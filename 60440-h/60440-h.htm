<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

</div>
<p>In commencing a new volume I would devote a
few pages to the consideration of the import of the
facts already collected concerning the London
Street-Folk, not only as regards the street-people
themselves, but also in connection with the general
society of which they form so large a proportion.</p>

<p>The precise extent of the proportion which the
Street-Traders bear to the rest of the Metropolitan
Population is the first point to be evolved; for
the want, the ignorance, and the vice of a street-life
being in a direct ratio to the numbers, it becomes
of capital importance that we should know
how many are seeking to pick up a livelihood in
the public thoroughfares. This is the more essential
because the Government returns never <i>have</i>
given us, and probably never <i>will</i> give us, any
correct information respecting it. The Census of
1841 set down the “Hawkers, Hucksters, and
Pedlars” of the Metropolis as numbering 2045;
and from the inquiries I have made among the
street-sellers as to the means taken to obtain a full
account of their numbers for the next population
return, the Census of 1851 appears likely to be
about as correct in its statements concerning the
Street Traders and Performers as the one which
preceded it.</p>

<p>According to the accounts which have been collected
during the progress of this work, the number
of the London Street-People, so far as the inquiry
has gone, is upwards of 40,000. This sum is made
up of 30,000 Costermongers; 2000 Street-Sellers
of “Green-Stuff,” as Watercresses, Chickweed, and
Groundsell, Turf, &amp;c.; 4000 Street Sellers of Eatables
and Drinkables; 1000 selling Stationery,
Books, Papers, and Engravings in the streets;
and 4000 other street-sellers vending manufactured
articles, either of metal, crockery, textile,
chemical, or miscellaneous substances, making altogether
41,000, or in round numbers say 40,000
individuals. The 30,000 costermongers may be
said to include 12,000 men, 6000 women, and
12,000 children.</p>

<p>The above numbers comprise the main body of
people selling in the London streets; hence if we
assert that, with the vendors of second-hand articles,
as old metal, glass, linen, clothes, &amp;c., and mineral
productions, such as coke, salt, and sand, there are
about 45,000 street-traders in the Metropolis, we
shall not, I am satisfied, be very far from the truth.</p>

<p>The value of the Capital, or Stock in Trade, of
these people, though individually trifling, amounts,
collectively, to a considerable sum of money&mdash;indeed,
to very nearly 40,000<i>l.</i>, or at the rate of
about 1<i>l.</i> per head. Under the term Capital are
included the donkeys, barrows, baskets, stalls,
trays, boards, and goods belonging to the several
street-traders; and though the stock of the water-cress,
the small-ware, the lucifer, the flower, or the
chickweed and groundsell seller may not exceed in
value 1<i>s.</i>, and the basket or tray upon which it is
carried barely half that sum, that of the more
prosperous costermonger, possessed of his barrow
and donkey; or of the Cheap John, with his cart
filled with hardware; or the Packman, with his
bale of soft wares at his back, may be worth almost
as many pounds as the others are pence.</p>

<p>The gross amount of trade done by the London
Street-Sellers in the course of the year is so large
that the mind is at first unable to comprehend how,
without reckless extravagance, want can be in any
way associated with the class. After the most
cautious calculation, the results having been checked
and re-checked in a variety of ways, so that the conclusion
arrived at might be somewhat near and
certainly not beyond the truth, it appears that the
“<i>takings</i>” of the London Street-Sellers cannot be
said to be less than 2,500,000<i>l.</i> per annum. But
vast as this sum may seem, and especially when
considered as only a portion of the annual expenditure
of the Metropolitan Poor, still, when we come
to spread the gross yearly receipts over 40,000
people, we find that the individual takings are but
62<i>l.</i> per annum, which (allowing the rate of profit
to be in all cases even 50 per cent., though I am
convinced it is often much less) gives to each street-trader
an annual income of 20<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, or within
a fraction of 8<i>s.</i> a week, all the year round. And
when we come to deduct from this the loss by
perishable articles, the keep of donkeys, the wear
and tear, or hire, of barrows&mdash;the cost of stalls and
baskets, together with the interest on stock-money
(generally at the rate of 4<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;and often
1<i>s.</i> a day&mdash;for 1<i>l.</i>, or 1040<i>l.</i> per cent. per annum),
we may with safety assert that the average gain or
clear income of the Metropolitan Street-Sellers is
rather under than over 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week. Some of
the more expert street-traders may clear 10<i>s.</i> or
even 15<i>s.</i> weekly throughout the year, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
weekly profit of the less expert, the old people,
and the children, may be said to be 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> These
incomes, however, are the average of the gross
yearly profits rather than the regular weekly gains;
the consequence is, that though they might be
sufficient to keep the majority of the street-sellers
in comparative comfort, were they constant and
capable of being relied upon, from week to week&mdash;but
being variable and uncertain, and rising
sometimes from nothing in the winter to 1<i>l.</i> a week
in the summer, when street commodities are plentiful
and cheap, and the poorer classes have money
wherewith to purchase them&mdash;and fluctuating
moreover, even at the best of times, according as
the weather is wet or fine, and the traffic of the
streets consequently diminished or augmented&mdash;it
is but natural that the people subject to such
alternations should lack the prudence and temperance
of those whose incomes are more regular
and uniform.</p>

<p>To place the above facts clearly before the
reader the following table has been prepared. The
first column states the titles of the several classes
of street-sellers; the second, the number of individuals
belonging to each of these classes; the
third, the value of their respective capitals or stock
in trade; the fourth, the gross amount of trade done
by them respectively every year; the fifth, the average
yearly takings of each class; and the sixth,
their average weekly gains. This gives us, as it
were, a bird’s-eye view of the earnings and pecuniary
condition of the various kinds of street-sellers
already treated of. It is here cited, as indeed
all the statistics in this work are, as an approximation
to the truth rather than a definite
and accurate result.</p>

<p>Now, according to the above estimate, it would
appear that the gross annual receipts of the entire
body of street-sellers (for there are many besides
those above specified&mdash;as for instance, the vendors
of second-hand articles, &amp;c.) may be estimated in
round numbers at 3,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling, and their
clear income at about 1,000,000<i>l.</i> per annum.
Hence, we are enabled to perceive the importance
of the apparently insignificant traffic of the streets;
for were the street-traders to be prohibited from
pursuing their calling, and so forced to apply for
relief at the several metropolitan unions, the poor-rates
would be at the least doubled. The total
sum expended in the relief of the London poor,
during 1848, was 725,000<i>l.</i>, but this we see is
hardly three-fourths of the income of the street-traders.
Those, therefore, who would put an end
to the commerce of our streets, should reflect
whether they would like to do so at the cost
of doubling the present poor-rates and of reducing
one-fortieth part of the entire metropolitan population
from a state of comparative independence to
absolute pauperism.</p>

<p>However unsatisfactory it may be to the aristocratic
pride of the wealthy commercial classes, it
cannot be denied that a very important element of
the trade of this vast capital&mdash;this marvellous
centre of the commerce of the world&mdash;I cite the
stereotype phrases of civic eloquence, for they
are at least truths&mdash;it is still undeniable, I say,
that a large proportion of the commerce of the
capital of Great Britain is in the hands of the
Street-Folk. This simple enunciation might appear
a mere platitude were it not that the street-sellers
are a <i>proscribed class</i>. They are driven from
stations to which long possession might have been
thought to give them a quasi legal right; driven
from them at the capricious desire of the shopkeepers,
some of whom have had bitter reason, by
the diminution of their own business, to repent
their interference. They are bandied about at the
will of a police-officer. They must “move on”
and not obstruct a thoroughfare which may be
crammed and blocked with the carriages of the
wealthy until to cross the road on foot is a danger.
They are, in fine, a body numbering thousands,
who are allowed to live in the prosecution of the
most ancient of all trades, sale or barter in the
open air, <i>by sufferance alone</i>. They are classed as
unauthorized or illegal and intrusive traders, though
they <i>“turn over” millions in a year</i>.</p>

<p>The authorities, it is true, do not sanction any
general arbitrary enforcement of the legal proscription
of the Street-Folk, but they have no option
if a section of shopkeepers choose to say to them,
“Drive away from our doors these street-people.”
It appears to be sufficient for an inferior class of
tradesmen&mdash;for such the meddlers with the street-folk
generally seem to be&mdash;merely to desire such
a removal in order to accomplish it. It is not
necessary for them to say in excuse, “We pay
heavy rents, and rates, and taxes, and are forced to
let our lodgings accordingly; we pay for licences, and
some of us as well pay fines for giving short weight
to poor people, and that, too, when it is hardly safe
to give short weight to our richer patrons; but
what rates, taxes, or licences do these street-traders
pay? Their lodgings may be dear enough,
but their rates are nominally nothing” (being
charged in the rent of their rooms). “From taxes
they are blessedly exempt. They are called upon
to pay no imposts on their property or income;
they defray merely the trifling duties on their
tobacco, beer, tea, sugar, coffee” (though these by
the way&mdash;the chief articles in the excise and
customs returns&mdash;make up one-half of the revenue
of the country). “They ought to be put down.
<i>We</i> can supply all that is wanting. What may
become of <i>them</i> is simply their own concern.”</p>

<p>The Act 50 Geo. III., c. 41, requires that every
person “carrying to sell or exposing to sale any
goods, wares, or merchandize,” shall pay a yearly
duty. But according to s. 23, “nothing in this
Act shall extend to prohibit any person or persons
from selling (by hawking in the streets) any printed
papers licensed by authority; or any fish, fruit, or
victuals.” Among the privileged articles are also
included barm or yeast, and coals. The same Act,
moreover, contains nothing to prohibit the maker
of any home-manufacture from exposing his goods
to sale in any town-market or fair, nor any tinker,
cooper, glazier, or other artizan, from going about
and carrying the materials of his business. The
unlicensed itinerant vendors of such things however
as lucifer-matches, boot-laces, braces, fuzees, or
any wares indeed, not of their own manufacture,
are violators of the law, and subject to a penalty
of 10<i>l.</i>, or three months’ imprisonment for each
offence. It is in practice, however, only in the
hawking of such articles as those on which the
duty is heavy and of considerable value to the
revenue (such as tea, tobacco, or cigars), that there
is any actual check in the London streets.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a large proportion of the street-trading
without a licence is contrary to law, and
the people seeking to obtain a living by such
means are strictly liable to fine or imprisonment,
while even those street-traders whom the Act
specially exempts&mdash;as for instance the street-sellers
of fish, fruit, and vegetables, and of eatables and
drinkables, as well as the street artizans, and who
are said to have the right of “exposing their
goods to sale in any market or fair in every city,
borough, town-corporate, and market-town”&mdash;even
these, I say, are liable to be punished for obstructing
the highway whenever they attempt to do so.</p>

<p>Now these are surely anomalies which it is
high time, in these free-trade days, should cease.
<i>The endeavour to obtain an honest and independent
livelihood should subject no man to fine
or imprisonment</i>; nor should the poor hawker&mdash;the
neediest perhaps of all tradesmen&mdash;be required
to pay 4<i>l.</i> a year for the liberty to carry on his
business when the wealthy shopkeeper can do so
“scot-free.” Moreover, it is a glaring iniquity
that the rich tradesman should have it in his
power, by complaining to the police, to deprive his
poorer rival of the right to dispose of his goods in
the streets. It is often said, in justification, that
as the shopkeepers pay the principal portion of
the rates and taxes, <i>they</i> must be protected in
the exercise of their business. But this, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
first place, is far from the truth. As regards the
taxes, the poorer classes pay nearly half of the
national imposts: they pay the chief portion of
the malt duty, and that is in round numbers
5,000,000<i>l.</i> a year; the greater part of the spirit
duty, which is 4,350,000<i>l.</i>; the tobacco duty,
4,250,000<i>l.</i>; the sugar duty, 4,500,000<i>l.</i>; and
the duty on tea, 5,330,000<i>l.</i>; making altogether
23,430,000<i>l.</i>, out of about 50,000,000<i>l.</i> Concerning
the rates, however, it is not so easy to
estimate what proportion the poor people contribute
towards the local burdens of the country;
but if they are householders, they have to pay
quota of the parish and county expenses directly,
and, if lodgers, indirectly in the rent of their
apartments. Hence it is evident, that to consider
the street-sellers unworthy of being protected in
the exercise of their calling because they pay
neither rates nor taxes, is to commit a gross injustice,
not only to the street-sellers themselves by
forcing them to contribute in their tea and sugar,
their beer, gin, and tobacco, towards the expenses
of a Government which exerts itself rather to
injure than benefit them, but likewise to the ratepayers
of the parish; for it is a necessary consequence,
if the shopkeepers have the power to
deprive the street-dealers of their living whenever
the out-of-door tradesmen are thought to interfere
with the business of those indoors (perhaps by
underselling them), that the street-dealers, being
unable to live by their own labour, must betake
themselves to the union and live upon the labour
of the parishioners, and thus the shopkeepers
may be said to enrich themselves at the expense,
not only of the poor street-people, but likewise
of their brother ratepayers.</p>

<p>Nor can it be said that the <i>Street-Sellers</i> are
interlopers upon these occasions, for if ancient
custom be referred to, it will be found that the
Shopkeepers are the real intruders, they having
succeeded the Hawkers, who were, in truth, the
original distributors of the produce of the country.</p>

<p>But though no body of Shopkeepers, nor,
indeed, any other class of people <i>individually</i>,
should possess the power to deprive the Hawkers
of what is often the last shift of struggling
independence&mdash;the sale of a few goods in the
street&mdash;still it is evident that the <i>general</i> convenience
of the public must be consulted, and
that, were the Street-Traders to be allowed the
right of pitching in any thoroughfare they pleased,
many of our principal streets would be blocked up
with costers’ barrows, and the kerb of Regent-street
possibly crowded like that of the New Cut,
with the hawkers and hucksters that would be
sure to resort thither; while those thoroughfares
which, like Fleet-street and Cheapside, are now
almost impassable at certain times of the day,
from the increased traffic of the City, would be
rendered still more impervious by the throngs of
street-sellers that the crowd alone would be sure
to attract to the spot.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, therefore, it becomes
necessary that we should provide for the vast
body of Street-Sellers some authorized place of
resort, where they might be both entitled and
permitted to obtain an honest living according to
Act of Parliament. To think for a moment of
“putting down” street-trading is to be at once
ignorant of the numbers and character of the
people pursuing it. To pass an Act declaring
50,000 individuals rogues and vagabonds, would
be to fill our prisons or our workhouses with men
who would willingly earn their own living. Besides,
the poor <i>will</i> buy of the poor. Subject the
petty trader to fine and imprisonment as you
please, still the very sympathy and patronage of
the petty purchaser will in this country always
call into existence a large body of purveyors to
the poorer classes. I would suggest, therefore,
and I do so after much consideration, and an
earnest desire to meet all the difficulties of the
case, that a number of “poor men’s markets” be
established throughout London, by the purchase
or rental of plots of ground in the neighbourhood
of the present street-markets; that a small toll be
paid by each of the Street-Sellers attending such
markets, for the right to vend their goods there&mdash;that
the keeper or beadle of each market be likewise
an Inspector of Weights and Measures,
and that any hawker found using “slangs” of
any kind, or resorting to any imposition whatever,
be prohibited entering the market for the
future&mdash;that the conduct and regulation of the
markets be under the direction of a committee
consisting of an equal number of shareholders,
sellers, and working men&mdash;the latter as representatives
of the buyers&mdash;and that the surplus
funds (if any, after paying all expenses, together
with a fair interest to the shareholders of the
market) should be devoted to the education of
the children of the hawkers before and after the
hours of sale. There might also be a penny
savings’-bank in connection with each of the markets,
and a person stationed at the gates on the
conclusion of the day’s business, to collect all he
could from the hawkers as they left.</p>

<p>There are already a sufficient number of poor-markets
established at the East end of the
town&mdash;though of a different character, such as
the Old Clothes Exchange&mdash;to prove the practicability
of the proposed plan among even the
pettiest traders. And I am convinced, after long
deliberation, that such institutions could not but
tend to produce a rapid and marked improvement
in the character of the London Hawkers.</p>

<p>This is the only way evident to me of meeting
the evil of our present street-life&mdash;an evil which
is increasing every day, and which threatens, ere
long, almost to overwhelm us with its abominations.
To revile the street-people is stark folly.
Their ignorance is no demerit to them, even as it
is no merit to us to know the little that we
do. If we really wish the people better, let
us, I say again, do for them what others have
done for us, and without which (humiliating as
it may be to our pride) we should most assuredly
have been as they are. It is the continued forgetfulness
of this truth&mdash;a truth which our
wretched self-conceit is constantly driving from
our minds&mdash;that prevents our stirring to improve
the condition of these poor people; though, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
knew but the whole of the facts concerning
them, and their sufferings and feelings, our very
fears alone for the safety of the state would be
sufficient to make us do something in their behalf.
I am quite satisfied, from all I have seen, that
there are thousands in this great metropolis ready
to rush forth, on the least evidence of a rising of
the people, to commit the most savage and revolting
excesses&mdash;men who have no knowledge of
the government of the country but as an armed
despotism, preventing their earning their living,
and who hate all law, because it is made to appear
to them merely as an organised tyranny&mdash;men,
too, who have neither religious nor moral principles
to restrain the exercise of their grossest passions
when once roused, and men who, from our
very neglect of them, are necessarily and essentially
the dangerous classes, whose existence we
either rail at or deplore.</p>

<p>The rate of increase among the street-traders it
is almost impossible to arrive at. The population
returns afford us no data for the calculation, and
the street-people themselves are unable to supply
the least information on the subject; all they can
tell us is, that about 20 years ago they took a
guinea for every shilling that they get now. This
heavy reduction of their receipts they attribute to
the cheapness of commodities, and the necessity
to carry and sell a greater quantity of goods in
order to get the same profit, as well as to the increase
in the number of street-traders; but when
questioned as to the extent of such increase, their
answers are of the vaguest possible kind. Arranging
the street-people, however, as we have done,
into three distinct classes, according to the causes
which have led to their induction into a street-life,
viz., those who are <i>born</i> and <i>bred</i> to the
streets&mdash;those who <i>take</i> to the streets&mdash;and
those who are <i>driven</i> to the streets, it is evident
that the main elements of any extraordinary increase
of the street-folk must be sought for among
the two latter classes. Among the first the increase
will, at the utmost, be at the same rate
as the ordinary increase of the population&mdash;viz.,
1&frac12; per cent. per annum; for the English costermongers
and street-traders in general appear to
be remarkable rather for the small than the large
number of their children, so that, even supposing
all the boys and girls of the street-sellers to be
brought up to the same mode of life as their
father, we could not thus account for any <i>enormous</i>
increase among the street-folk. With those,
however, who <i>take</i> to the streets from the love of
a “roving life,” or the desire to “shake a free
leg”&mdash;to quote the phrases of the men themselves&mdash;or
are <i>driven</i> to the streets from an inability
to obtain employment at the pursuit to
which they have been accustomed, the case is far
different.</p>

<p>That there is every day a greater difficulty for
working men to live by their labour&mdash;either from
the paucity of work, or from the scanty remuneration
given for it&mdash;surely no one will be disposed to
question when every one is crying out that the
country is over-populated. Such being the case, it
is evident that the number of mechanics in the
streets must be daily augmenting, for, as I have
before said, street-trading is the last shift of an unemployed
artizan to keep himself and his family
from the “Union.” The workman out of work,
sooner than starve or go to the parish for relief,
takes to making up and vending on his own account
the articles of his craft, whilst the underpaid
workman, sooner than continue toiling from morning
till midnight for a bare subsistence, resorts to
the easier trade of buying and selling. Again,
even among the less industrious of the working
classes, the general decline in wages has tended,
and is continually tending, to make their labour
more and more irksome to them. There is a cant
abroad at the present day, that there is a special
pleasure in industry, and hence we are taught
to regard all those who object to work as appertaining
to the class of natural vagabonds; but
where is the man among us that loves labour?
for work or labour is merely that which is irksome
to perform, and which every man requires
a certain amount of remuneration to induce him
to perform. If men really loved work they would
pay to be allowed to do it rather than require
to be paid for doing it. That occupation
which is agreeable to us we call amusement, and
that and that only which is disagreeable we term
labour, or drudgery, according to the intensity of
its irksomeness. Hence as the amount of remuneration
given by way of inducement to a man to
go through a certain amount of work becomes reduced,
so does the stimulus to work become weakened,
and this, through the decline of wages,
is what is daily taking place among us. Our operatives
are continually ceasing to be producers,
and passing from the creators of wealth into the
exchangers or distributors of it; becoming mere
tradesmen, subsisting on the labour of other
people rather than their own, and so adding to
the very non-producers, the great number of
whom is the main cause of the poverty of those
who make all our riches. To teach a people
the difficulty of living by labour is to inculcate the
most dangerous of all lessons, and this is what
we are daily doing. Our trading classes are increasing
at a most enormous rate, and so giving
rise to that exceeding competition, and consequently,
to that continual reduction of prices&mdash;all
of which must ultimately fall upon the working
man. This appears to me to be the main cause of
the increase of the London street people, and one
for which I candidly confess I see no remedy.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_SECOND-HAND_ARTICLES"></a>OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF SECOND-HAND ARTICLES.</h2>
</div>

<p>I have already treated of the street-commerce in
such things as are presented to the public in the form
in which they are to be cooked, eaten, drank, or used.
They have comprised the necessaries, delicacies,
or luxuries of the street; they have been either the
raw food or preparations ready cooked or mixed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
immediate consumption, as in the case of the street
eatables and drinkables; or else they were the
proceeds of taste (or its substitute) in art or literature,
or of usefulness or ingenuity in manufacture.</p>

<p>All these many objects of street-commerce may
be classified in one well-known word: they are
bought and sold <i>first-hand</i>. I have next to deal
with the <i>second-hand</i> sellers of our streets; and
in this division perhaps will be found more that is
novel, curious, and interesting, than in that just
completed.</p>

<p>Mr. Babbage, in his “Economy of Machinery
and Manufactures,” says, concerning the employment
of materials of little value: “The worn-out
saucepan and tin-ware of our kitchens, when beyond
the reach of the tinker’s art, are not utterly worthless.
We sometimes meet carts loaded with old
tin kettles and worn-out iron coal-skuttles traversing
our streets. These have not yet completed
their useful course; the less corroded parts are
cut into strips, punched with small holes, and
varnished with a coarse black varnish for the use
of the trunk-maker, who protects the edges and
angles of his boxes with them; the remainder are
conveyed to the manufacturing chemists in the
outskirts, who employ them in combination with
pyroligneous acid, in making a black dye for the
use of calico-printers.”</p>

<p>Mr. Babbage has here indicated one portion
of the nature of the street-trade in second-hand
articles&mdash;the application of worn-out materials
to a new purpose. But this second-hand
commerce of the streets&mdash;for a street-commerce it
mainly is, both in selling and buying&mdash;has a far
greater extent than that above indicated, and many
ramifications. Under the present head I shall
treat only of street <i>sellers</i>, unless when a street
<i>purchase</i> may be so intimately connected with a
street <i>sale</i> that for the better understanding of the
subject it may be necessary to sketch both. Of
the <span class="smcap">Street-Buyers</span> and the <span class="smcap">Street-Finders</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Collectors</span>, both connected with the second-hand
trade, I shall treat separately.</p>

<p>In London, where many, in order to live, struggle
to extract a meal from the possession of an article
which seems utterly worthless, nothing must be
wasted. Many a thing which in a country town
is kicked by the penniless out of their path even,
or examined and left as meet only for the scavenger’s
cart, will in London be snatched up as a prize; it
is money’s worth. A crushed and torn bonnet, for
instance, or, better still, an old hat, napless, shapeless,
crownless, and brimless, will be picked up in
the street, and carefully placed in a bag with
similar things by one class of street-folk&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Street-Finders</span>. And to tempt the well-to-do to
<i>sell</i> their second-hand goods, the street-trader
offers the barter of shapely china or shining glass
vessels; or blooming fuchsias or fragrant geraniums
for “the rubbish,” or else, in the spirit of the
hero of the fairy tale, he exchanges, “new lamps
for old.”</p>

<p>Of the street sale of second-hand articles, with
all the collateral or incidental matter bearing immediately
on the subject, I shall treat under the
following heads, or under such heads as really
constitute the staple of the business, dismissing
such as may be trifling or exceptional. Of these
traffickers, then, there are five classes, the mere
enumeration of the objects of their traffic being
curious <span class="lock">enough:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The Street-Sellers of Old Metal Articles</i>, such
as knives, forks, and butchers’ steels; saws, hammers,
pincers, files, screw-drivers, planes, chisels,
and other tools (more frequently those of the
workers in wood than of other artisans); old
scissors and shears; locks, keys, and hinges;
shovels, fire-irons, trivets, chimney-cranes, fenders,
and fire-guards; warming-pans (but rarely
now); flat and Italian irons, curling-tongs; rings,
horse-shoes, and nails; coffee and tea-pots, urns,
trays, and canisters; pewter measures; scales and
weights; bed-screws and keys; candlesticks and
snuffers; niggards, generally called niggers (<i>i. e.</i>,
false bottoms for grates); tobacco and snuff-boxes
and spittoons; door-plates, numbers, knockers,
and escutcheons; dog-collars and dog-chains (and
other chains); gridirons; razors; coffee-mills;
lamps; swords and daggers; gun and pistol-barrels
and locks (and occasionally the entire
weapon); bronze and cast metal figures; table,
chair, and sofa castors; bell-pulls and bells; the
larger buckles and other metal (most frequently
brass) articles of harness furniture; compositors’
sticks (the depositories of the type in the first
instance); the multifarious kinds of tin-wares;
stamps; cork-screws; barrel-taps; ink-stands; a
multiplicity of culinary vessels and of old metal lids;
footmen, broken machinery, and parts of machinery,
as odd wheels, and screws of all sizes, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Street-Sellers of Old Linen, Cotton, and
Woollen Articles</i>, such as old sheeting for towels;
old curtains of dimity, muslin, cotton, or moreen;
carpeting; blanketing for house-scouring cloths;
ticking for beds and pillows; sacking for different
purposes, according to its substance and quality;
fringes; and stocking-legs for the supply of “jobbing
worsted,” and for re-footing.</p>

<p>I may here observe that in the street-trade,
second-hand linen or cotton is often made to pay
a double debt. The shirt-collars sold, sometimes
to a considerable extent and very cheap, in the
street-markets, are made out of linen which has
previously been used in some other form; so is it
with white waistcoats and other habiliments. Of
the street-folk who vend such wares I shall speak
chiefly in the fourth division of this subject, viz. the
second-hand street-sellers of miscellaneous articles.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Street-Sellers of Old Glass and Crockery</i>,
including the variety of bottles, odd, or in sets,
or in broken sets; pans, pitchers, wash-hand
basins, and other crockery utensils; china ornaments;
pier, convex, and toilet glasses (often
without the frames); pocket ink-bottles; wine,
beer, and liqueur glasses; decanters; glass fish-bowls
(occasionally); salt-cellars; sugar-basins;
and lamp and gas glasses.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Street-Sellers of Miscellaneous Articles.</i>
These are such as cannot properly be classed under

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before proceeding immediately with my subject,
I may say a few words concerning what is,
in the estimation of some, a <i>second-hand</i> matter.
I allude to the many uses to which that which is
regarded, and indeed termed, “offal,” or “refuse,”
or “waste,” is put in a populous city. This may
be evidenced in the multiform uses to which the
“offal” of the animals which are slaughtered for
our use are put. It is still more curiously shown
in the uses of the offal of the animals which are
killed, not for our use, but for that of our dogs
and cats; and to this part of the subject I shall
more especially confine the remarks I have to
make. My observations on the uses of other
waste articles will be found in another place.</p>

<p>What in the butcher’s trade is considered the
offal of a bullock, was explained by Mr. Deputy
Hicks, before the last Select Committee of the
House of Commons on Smithfield Market: “The
carcass,” he said, “as it hangs clear of everything
else, is the carcass, and all else constitutes the
offal.”</p>

<p>The carcass may be briefly termed the four
quarters, whereas the offal then comprises the
hide, which in the average-sized bullock that is
slaughtered in London is worth 12<i>s.</i>; but with the
hide are sold the horns, which are worth about
10<i>d.</i> to the comb-makers, who use them to make
their “tortoise-shell” articles, and for similar
purposes. The hoofs are worth 2<i>d.</i> to the glue-makers,
or prussiate of potash manufacturers.
What “comes out of a bullock,” to use the trade
term, is the liver, the lights (or lungs), the stomach,
the intestinal canal (sometimes 36 yards when
extended), and the gall duct. These portions,
with the legs (called “feet” in the trade), form
what is styled the tripe-man’s portion, and are
disposed of to him by the butcher for 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
Separately, the value of the liver is 8<i>d.</i>, of the
lights, 6<i>d.</i> (both for dogs’-meat), and of the legs
which are worked into tooth-brush handles,
dominoes, &amp;c., 1<i>s.</i> The remaining 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> is the
worth of the other portion. The heart averages
rather more than 1<i>s.</i>; the kidneys the same; the
head, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>; the blood (which is “let down the
drain” in all but the larger slaughtering houses)
1&frac12;<i>d.</i> (being 3<i>d.</i> for 9 gallons); the tallow (7 stone)
14<i>s.</i>; and the tail, I was told, “from nothing to
2<i>s.</i>,” averaging about 6<i>d.</i>; the tongue, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
Thus the offal sells, altogether, first hand, for
1<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>I will now show the uses to which what is far
more decidedly pronounced “offal,” and what is
much more “second-hand” in popular estimation,
viz., a dead horse, is put, and even a dead horse’s
offal, and I will then show the difference in this
curious trade between the Parisian and London
horse offal.</p>

<p>The greatest horse-slaughtering establishments
in France are at Montfaucon, a short distance
from the capital. When the animal has been
killed, it is “cut up,” and the choicer portions of
the flesh are eaten by the work-people of the
establishment, and by the hangers-on and jobbers
who haunt the locality of such places, and are
often men of a desperate character. The rest of
the carcass is sold for the feeding of dogs, cats,
pigs, and poultry, a portion being also devoted to
purposes of manure. The flesh on a horse of
average size and fatness is 350 lbs., which sells
for 1<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> But this is only one of the uses of
the dead animal.</p>

<p>The skin is sold to a tanner for 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The
hoofs to a manufacturer of sal ammonia, or similar
preparations, or of Prussian blue, or to a comb or
toy-maker, for 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The old shoes and the
shoe-nails are worth 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> The hair of the mane
and tail realizes 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> The tendons are disposed
of, either fresh or dried, to glue-makers for 3<i>d.</i>&mdash;a
pound of dried tendons (separated from the
muscles) being about the average per horse. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
bones are bought by the turners, cutlers, fan-makers,
and the makers of ivory black and sal
ammoniac, 90 lbs. being an average weight of the
animal’s bones, and realizing 2<i>s.</i> The intestines
wrought into the different preparations required of
the gut-makers, or for manure, are worth 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The blood is used by the sugar-refiners, and by
the fatteners of poultry, pigeons, and turkeys
(which devour it greedily), or else for manure.
When required for manure it is dried&mdash;20 lbs. of
dried blood, which is the average weight, being
worth 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> The fat is removed from the carcass
and melted down. It is in demand for the
making of gas, of soap, and (when very fine) of&mdash;bear’s
grease; also for the dubbing or grease
applied to harness and to shoe-leather. This fat
when consumed in lamps communicates a greater
portion of heat than does oil, and is therefore
preferred by the makers of glass toys, and by
enamellers and polishers. A horse at Montfaucon
has been known to yield 60 lbs. of fat, but this is
an extreme case; a yield of 12 lbs. is the produce
of a horse in fair condition, but at these slaughterhouses
there are so many lean and sorry jades
that 8 lbs. may be taken as an average of fat, and
at a value of 6<i>d.</i> per lb. Nor does the list end
here; the dead and putrid flesh is made to teem
with life, and to produce food for other living
creatures. A pile of pieces of flesh, six inches in
height, layer on layer, is slightly covered with hay
or straw; the flies soon deposit their eggs in the
attractive matter, and thus maggots are bred, the
most of which are used as food for pheasants, and
in a smaller degree of domestic fowls, and as baits
for fish. These maggots give, or are supposed to
give, a “game flavour” to poultry, and a very
“high” flavour to pheasants. One horse’s flesh
thus produces maggots worth 1<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> The total
amount, then, realized on the dead horse, which
may cost 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The carcass of a French horse is also made
available in another way, and which relates to a
subject I have lately treated of&mdash;the destruction of
rats; but this is not a regularly-accruing emolument.
Montfaucon swarms with rats, and to kill
them the carcass of a horse is placed in a room,
into which the rats gain access through openings in
the floor contrived for the purpose. At night the
rats are lured by their keenness of scent to the
room, and lured in numbers; the openings are
then closed, and they are prisoners. In one room
16,000 were killed in four weeks. The Paris
furriers gave from three to four francs for 100
skins, so that, taking the average at 3<i>s.</i> of our
money, 16,000 rat-skins would return 24<i>l.</i></p>

<p>In London the uses of the dead horse’s flesh,
bones, blood, &amp;c., are different.</p>

<p>Horse-flesh is not&mdash;as yet&mdash;a portion of human
food in this country. In a recent parliamentary
inquiry, witnesses were examined as to whether
horse-flesh was used by the sausage-makers.
There was some presumption that such might be
the case, but no direct evidence. I found, however,
among butchers who had the best means of
knowing, a strong conviction that such <i>was</i> the
case. One highly-respectable tradesman told me
he was as certain of it as that it was the month
of June, though, if called upon to produce legal
evidence proving either that such was the sausage-makers’
practice, or that this <i>was</i> the month of
June, he might fail in both instances.</p>

<p>I found among street-people who dealt in provisions
a strong, or, at any rate, a strongly-expressed,
opinion that the tongues, kidneys, and
hearts of horses were sold as those of oxen. One
man told me, somewhat triumphantly, as a result
of his ingenuity in deduction, that he had thoughts
at one time of trying to establish himself in a
cats’-meat walk, and made inquiries into the nature
of the calling: “I’m satisfied the ’osses’ ’arts,” he
said, “is sold for beastesses’; ’cause you see, sir,
there’s nothing as ’ud be better liked for favourite
cats and pet dogs, than a nice piece of ’art, but
ven do you see the ’osses’ ’arts on a barrow? If
they don’t go to the cats, vere does they go to?
Vy, to the Christians.”</p>

<p>I am assured, however, by tradesmen whose
interest (to say nothing of other considerations)
would probably make them glad to expose such
practices, that this substitution of the equine for
the bovine heart is not attempted, and is hardly
possible. The bullock’s heart, kidneys, and
tongue, are so different in shape (the heart, more
especially), and in the colour of the fat, while the
rough tip of the ox’s tongue is not found in that of
the horse, that this second-hand, or offal kind of
animal food could not be palmed off upon any one
who had ever purchased the heart, kidneys, or
tongue of an ox. “If the horse’s tongue be used
as a substitute for that of any other,” said one
butcher to me, “it is for the dried reindeer’s&mdash;a
savoury dish for the breakfast table!” Since
writing the above, I have had convincing proof
given me that the horses’ tongues are cured and
sold as “neats.” The heart and kidneys are also
palmed, I find, for those of oxen!! Thus, in one
respect, there is a material difference between
the usages, in respect of this food, between Paris
and London.</p>

<p>One tradesman, in a large way of business&mdash;with
many injunctions that I should make no
allusion that might lead to his being known, as he
said it might be his ruin, even though he never
slaughtered the meat he sold, but was, in fact, a
dead salesman or a vendor of meat consigned to
him&mdash;one tradesman, I say, told me that he fancied
there was an <i>unreasonable</i> objection to the
eating of horse-flesh among us. The horse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
quite as dainty in his food as the ox, he was
quite as graminivorous, and shrunk more, from a
nicer sense of smell, from anything pertaining to a
contact with animal food than did the ox. The
principal objection lies in the number of diseased
horses sold at the knackers. My informant reasoned
only from analogy, as he had never tasted
horse-flesh; but a great-uncle of his, he told me,
had relished it highly in the peninsular war.</p>

<p>The uses to which a horse’s carcass are put in
London are these:&mdash;The skin, for tanning, sells for
6<i>s.</i> as a low average; the hoofs, for glue, are
worth 2<i>d.</i>; the shoes and nails, 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; the mane
and tail, 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; the bones, which in London (as
it was described to me) are “cracked up” for
manure, bring 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; the fat is melted down
and used for cart-grease and common harness
oil; one person acquainted with the trade thought
that the average yield of fat was 10 lbs. per
horse (“taking it low”), another that it was
12 lbs. (“taking it square”), so that if 11 lbs.
be accepted as an average, the fat, at 2<i>d.</i> per lb.,
would realize 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> Of the tendons no use is
made; of the blood none; and no maggots are
reared upon putrid horse-flesh, but a butcher, who
had been twenty years a farmer also, told me that
he knew from experience that there was nothing
so good as maggots for the fattening of poultry,
and he thought, from what I told him of maggot-breeding
in Montfaucon, that we were <i>behind</i> the
French in this respect.</p>

<p>Thus the English dead horse&mdash;the vendor receiving
on an average 1<i>l.</i> from the knacker,&mdash;realizes
the following amount, without including
the knacker’s profit in disposing of the flesh to
the cats’-meat man; but computing it merely at
2<i>l.</i> we have the subjoined <span class="lock">receipts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The French dead horse, then, is made a source
of nearly 5<i>s.</i> higher receipt than the English.
On my inquiring the reason of this difference, and
why the blood, &amp;c., were not made available, I
was told that the demand by the Prussian blue
manufacturers and the sugar refiners was so fully
supplied, and over-supplied, from the great cattle
slaughter-houses, that the private butchers, for the
trifling sum to be gained, let the blood be wasted.
One bullock slaughterer in Fox and Knot-yard,
who kills 180 cattle in a week, receives only 1<i>l.</i>
for the blood of the whole number, which is received
in a well in the slaughter-house. The
amount paid for blood a few years back was more
than double its present rate. Under these circumstances,
I was told, it would be useless trying to
turn the wasted offal of a horse to any profitable
purpose. There is, I am told, on an average,
1000 horses slaughtered every week in London,
and this, at 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> each animal, would make the
value of the dead horses of the metropolis amount
to 130,000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>Were it not that I might be dwelling too long
on the subject, I might point out how the offal of
the skins was made to subserve other purposes from
the Bermondsey tan-yards; and how the parings
and scrapings went to the makers of glue and size,
and the hair to the builders to mix with lime,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I may instance another thing in which the
worth of what in many places is valueless refuse
is exemplified, in the matter of “waste,” as waste
paper is always called in the trade. Paper in all
its glossiest freshness is but a reproduction of what
had become in some measure “waste,” viz. the
rags of the cotton or linen fabric after serving their
original purpose. There is a body of men in
London who occupy themselves entirely in collecting
waste paper. It is no matter of what kind;
a small prayer-book, a once perfumed and welcome
love-note, lawyers’ or tailors’ bills, acts of parliament,
and double sheets of the <i>Times</i>, form portions
of the waste dealer’s stock. Tons upon tons are
thus consumed yearly. Books of every description
are ingredients of this waste, and in every
language; modern poems or pamphlets and old
romances (perfect or imperfect), Shakespeare,
Molière, Bibles, music, histories, stories, magazines,
tracts to convert the heathen or to prove how
easily and how immensely our national and individual
wealth might be enhanced, the prospectuses
of a thousand companies, each certain to prove a
mine of wealth, schemes to pay off the national
debt, or recommendations to wipe it off, auctioneers’
catalogues and long-kept letters, children’s copy-books
and last century ledgers, printed effusions
which have progressed no further than the unfolded
sheets, uncut works and books mouldy from age&mdash;all
these things are found in the insatiate bag of
the waste collector, who of late has been worried
because he could not supply enough! “I don’t
know how it is, sir,” said one waste collector, with
whom I had some conversation on the subject of
street-sold books, with which business he was also
connected, “I can’t make it out, but paper gets
scarcer or else I’m out of luck. Just at this time
my family and me really couldn’t live on my waste
if we had to depend entirely upon it.”</p>

<p>I am assured that in no place in the world is
this traffic carried on to anything approaching the
extent that it is in London. When I treat of the
street-buyers I shall have some curious information
to publish on the subject. I do but allude to it
here as one strongly illustrative of “second-hand”
appliances.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-Hand
Metal Articles.</span></h3>

<p>I have in the preceding remarks specified the
wares sold by the vendors of the second-hand
articles of metal manufacture, or (as they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
called in the streets) the “old metal” men. The
several articles I have specified may never be all
found at one time upon one stall, but they are
all found on the respective stalls. “Aye, sir,”
said one old man whom I conversed with, “and
there’s more things every now and then comes to
the stalls, and there used to be still more when I
were young, but I can’t call them all to mind, for
times is worse with me, and so my memory fails.
But there used to be a good many bayonets, and
iron tinder-boxes, and steels for striking lights; I
can remember them.”</p>

<p>Some of the sellers have strong heavy barrows,
which they wheel from street to street. As this
requires a considerable exertion of strength, such
part of the trade is carried on by strong men,
generally of the costermongering class. The
weight to be propelled is about 300 lbs. Of this
class there are now a few, rarely more than half-a-dozen,
who sell on commission in the way I have
described concerning the swag-barrowmen.</p>

<p>These are the “old metal swags” of street
classification, but their remuneration is less fixed
than that of the other swag-barrowmen. It is sometimes
a quarter, sometimes a third, and sometimes
even a half of the amount taken. The
men carrying on this traffic are the servants of
the marine-store dealers, or vendors of old metal
articles, who keep shops. If one of these people
be “lumbered up,” that is, if he find his stock
increase too rapidly, he furnishes a barrow, and
sends a man into the streets with it, to sell what
the shopkeeper may find to be excessive. Sometimes
if the tradesman can gain only the merest
trifle more than he could gain from the people
who buy for the melting-pot, he is satisfied.</p>

<p>There is, or perhaps was, an opinion prevalent
that the street “old metals” in this way of business
got rid of stolen goods in such a manner as
the readiest mode of sale, some of which were
purposely rusted, and sold at almost any price,
so that they brought but a profit to the “fence,”
whose payment to the thief was little more than
the price of old metal at the foundry. I understand,
however, that this course is not now pursued,
nor is it likely that it ever was pursued to
any extent. The street-seller is directly under
the eye of the police, and when there is a search
for stolen goods, it is not very likely that they
would be paraded, however battered or rusted for
the purpose, before men who possessed descriptions
of all goods stolen. Until the establishment of
the present system of police, this might have been
an occasional practice. One street-seller had even
heard, and he “had it from the man what did it,”
that a last-maker’s shop was some years back
broken into in the expectation that money would
be met with, but none was found; and as the
thieves could not bring away such heavy lumbering
things as lasts, they cursed their ill-luck, and
brought away such tools as they could stow about
their persons, and cover with their loose great
coats. These were the large knives, fixed to
swivels, and resembling a small scythe, used by
the artizan to rough hew the block of beech-wood;
and a variety of excellent rasps and files
(for they must be of the best), necessary for the
completion of the last. These very tools were, in
ten days after the robbery, sold from a street-barrow.</p>

<p>The second-hand metal goods are sold from
stalls as well as from barrows, and these stalls are
often tended by women whose husbands may be
in some other branch of street-commerce. One of
these stalls I saw in the care of a stout elderly
Jewess, who was fast asleep, nodding over her
locks and keys. She was awakened by the
passing policeman, lest her stock should be pilfered
by the boys: “Come, wake up, mother, and
shake yourself,” he said, “I shall catch a weazel
asleep next.”</p>

<p>Some of these barrows and stalls are heaped
with the goods, and some are very scantily supplied,
but the barrows are by far the best stocked.
Many of them (especially the swag) look like
collections of the different stages of rust, from its
incipient spots to its full possession of the entire
metal. But amongst these seemingly useless
things there is a gleam of brass or plated ware.
On one barrow I saw an old brass door-plate, on
which was engraven the name of a late learned
judge, Baron <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>; another had formerly announced
the residence of a dignitary of the church,
the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The second-hand metal-sellers are to be seen
in all the street-markets, especially on the Saturday
nights; also in Poplar, Limehouse, and the Commercial-road,
in Golden-lane, and in Old-street
and Old-street-road, St. Luke’s, in Hoxton and
Shoreditch, in the Westminster Broadway, and
the Whitechapel-road, in Rosemary-lane, and in
the district where perhaps every street calling is
pursued, but where some special street-trades
seem peculiar to the genius of the place, in Petticoat-lane.
A person unacquainted with the last-named
locality may have formed an opinion that
Petticoat-lane is merely a lane or street. But
Petticoat-lane gives its name to a little district.

Black-horse-yard, Middlesex-street, Stoney-lane,
Meeting-house-yard, Gravel-lane, White-street,
Cutler-street, and Borer’s-lane, until the wayfarer
emerges into what appears the repose and spaciousness
of Devonshire-square, Bishopsgate-street,
up Borer’s-lane, or into what in the contrast
really looks like the aristocratic thoroughfare of
the Aldgate High-street, down Middlesex-street;
or into Houndsditch through the halls of the Old
Clothes Exchange.</p>

<p>All these narrow streets, lanes, rows, passages,
alleys, yards, courts, and places, are the
sites of the street-trade carried on in this quarter.
The whole neighbourhood rings with street cries,
many uttered in those strange east-end Jewish
tones which do not sound like English. Mixed
with the incessant invitations to buy Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dainties, or the “sheepest pargains,” is occasionally
heard the guttural utterance of the Erse
tongue, for the “native Irish,” as they are sometimes
called, are in possession of some portion of
the street-traffic of Petticoat-lane, the original Rag
Fair. The savour of the place is moreover peculiar.
There is fresh fish, and dried fish, and fish being
fried in a style peculiar to the Jews; there is the
fustiness of old clothes; there is the odour from
the pans on which (still in the Jewish fashion)
frizzle and hiss pieces of meat and onions; puddings
are boiling and enveloped in steam; cakes
with strange names are hot from the oven; tubs
of big pickled cucumbers or of onions give a sort
of acidity to the atmosphere; lemons and oranges
abound; and altogether the scene is not only such
as can only be seen in London, but only such as
can be seen in this one part of the metropolis.</p>

<p>When I treat of the street-Jews, I shall have
information highly curious to communicate, and
when I come to the fifth division of my present
subject, I shall more particularly describe Petticoat-lane,
as the head-quarters of the second-hand
clothes business.</p>

<p>I have here alluded to the character of this
quarter as being one much resorted to formerly,
and still largely used by the sellers of second-hand
metal goods. Here I was informed that a
strong-built man, known as Jack, or (appropriately
enough) as Iron Jack, had, until his death six or
seven years ago, one of the best-stocked barrows
in London. This, in spite of remonstrances, and
by a powerful exercise of his strength, the man
lifted, as it were, on to the narrow foot-path,
and every passer-by had his attention directed
almost perforce to the contents of the barrow, for
he must make a “<i>detour</i>” to advance on his way.
One of this man’s favourite pitches was close to
the lofty walls of what, before the change in their
charter, was one of the East India Company’s
vast warehouses. The contrast to any one who
indulged a thought on the subject&mdash;and there is
great food for thought in Petticoat-lane&mdash;was
striking enough. Here towered the store-house
of costly teas, and silks, and spices, and indigo;
while at its foot was carried on the most minute,
and apparently worthless of all street-trades, rusty
screws and nails, such as only few would care to
pick up in the street, being objects of earnest
bargaining!</p>

<p>An experienced man in the business, who
thought he was “turned 50, or somewhere about
that,” gave me the following account of his trade,
his customers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in most street-trades,” he said, “and
was born to it, like, for my mother was a rag-gatherer&mdash;not
a bad business once&mdash;and I helped
her. I never saw my father, but he was a soldier,
and it’s supposed lost his life in foreign parts.
No, I don’t remember ever having heard what
foreign parts, and it don’t matter. Well, perhaps,
this is about as tidy a trade for a bit of bread as
any that’s going now. Perhaps selling fish may
be better, but that’s to a man what knows fish
well. I can’t say I ever did. I’m more a dab
at cooking it (with a laugh). I like a bloater best
on what’s an Irish gridiron. Do you know what
that is, sir? I know, though I’m not Irish, but
I married an Irish wife, and as good a woman as
ever was a wife. It’s done on the tongs, sir, laid
across the fire, and the bloater’s laid across the
tongs. Some says it’s best turned and turned
very quick on the coals themselves, but the tongs
is best, for you can raise or lower.” [My informant
seemed interested in his account of this and
other modes of cookery, which I need not detail.]
“This is really a very trying trade. O, I mean
it tries a man’s patience so. Why, it was in
Easter week a man dressed like a gentleman&mdash;but
I don’t think he was a real gentleman&mdash;looked
out some bolts, and a hammer head, and other
things, odds and ends, and they came to 10&frac12;<i>d.</i>
He said he’d give 6<i>d.</i> ‘Sixpence!’ says I; ‘why
d’ you think I stole ’em?’ ‘Well,’ says he, ‘if
I didn’t think you’d stole ’em, I shouldn’t have
come to <i>you</i>.’ I don’t think he was joking.
Well, sir, we got to high words, and I said, ‘Then
I’m <span class="lock">d&mdash;d</span> if you have them for less than 1<i>s.</i>’
And a bit of a crowd began to gather, they was
most boys, but the p’liceman came up, as slow as
you please, and so my friend flings down 1<i>s.</i>, and
puts the things in his pocket and marches off,
with a few boys to keep him company. That’s
the way one’s temper’s tried. Well, it’s hard to
say what sells best. A latch-lock and keys goes
off quick. I’ve had them from 2<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>; but
it’s only the lower-priced things as sells now in
any trade. Bolts is a fairish stock, and so is all
sorts of tools. Well, not saws so much as such
things as screwdrivers, or hammers, or choppers,
or tools that if they’re rusty people can clean up
theirselves. Saws ain’t so easy to manage; bed-keys
is good. No, I don’t clean the metal up
unless it’s very bad; I think things don’t sell so
well that way. People’s jealous that they’re
just done up on purpose to deceive, though they
may cost only 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> There’s that cheese-cutter
now, it’s getting rustier and there’ll be
very likely a better chance to sell it. This is how
it is, sir, I know. You see if a man’s going to
buy old metal, and he sees it all rough and rusty,
he says to himself, ‘Well, there’s no gammon
about it; I can just see what it is.’ Then folks
like to clean up a thing theirselves, and it’s as if
it was something made from their own cleverness.
That was just my feeling, sir, when I bought old
metals for my own use, before I was in the trade,
and I goes by that. O, working people’s by far
my best customers. Many of ’em’s very fond of
jobbing about their rooms or their houses, and they
come to such as me. Then a many has fancies
for pigeons, or rabbits, or poultry, or dogs, and
they mostly make up the places for them theirselves,
and as money’s an object, why them sort
of fancy people buys hinges, and locks, and screws,
and hammers, and what they want of me. A
clever mechanic can turn his hand to most things
that he wants for his own use. I know a shoemaker
that makes beautiful rabbit-hutches and
sells them along with his prize cattle, as I calls
his great big long-eared rabbits. Perhaps I take
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> a day, and it’s about half profit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Yes, this time of the year I make good 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week, but in winter not 1<i>s.</i> a day. That
would be very poor pickings for two people
to live on, and I can’t do without my drop
of beer, but my wife has constant work with
a first-rate laundress at Mile End, and so we rub
on, for we’ve no family living.”</p>

<p>This informant told me further of the way in
which the old metal stocks sold in the streets
were provided; but that branch of the subject
relates to street-buying. Some of the street-sellers,
however, buy their stocks of the shopkeepers.</p>

<p>I find a difficulty in estimating the number of
the second-hand metal-ware street-sellers. Many
of the stalls or barrows are the property of the
marine-store shopkeepers, or old metal dealers
(marine stores being about the only things
the marine-store men do not sell), and these
are generally placed near the shop, being
indeed a portion of its contents out of doors.
Some of the marine-store men (a class of traders,
by the by, not superior to street-sellers, making
no “odious” comparison as to the honesty of
the two), when they have purchased largely&mdash;the
refuse iron for instance after a house has been
pulled down&mdash;establish two or three pitches in the
street, confiding the stalls or barrows to their
wives and children. I was told by several in the
trade that there were 200 old metal sellers in the
streets, but from the best information at my command
not more than 50 appear to be strictly
<i>street</i>-sellers, unconnected with shop-keeping.
Estimating a weekly receipt, per individual, of
15<i>s.</i> (half being profit), the yearly street outlay
among this body alone amounts to 1950<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-Hand
Metal Trays</span>, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>There are still some few portions of the old
metal trade in the streets which require specific
mention.</p>

<p>Among these is the sale of second-hand trays,
occasionally with such things as bread-baskets.
Instead of these wares, however, being matters of
daily traffic, they are offered in the streets only at
intervals, and generally on the Saturday and
Monday evenings, while a few are hawked to
public-houses. An Irishman, a rather melancholy
looking man, but possessed of some humour, gave
me the following account. His dress was a worn
suit, such as masons work in; but I have seldom
seen so coarse, and never on an Irishman of his
class, except on a Sunday, so clean a shirt, and he
made as free a display of it as if it were the
choicest cambric. He washed it, he told me, with
his own hands, as he had neither wife, nor mother,
nor sister. “I was a cow-keeper’s man,
your honour,” he said, “and he sent milk to
Dublin. I thought I might do betthur, and I got
to Liverpool, and walked here. Have I done
betthur, is it? Sorry a betthur. Would I like
to returren to Dublin? Well, perhaps, plaze God,
I’ll do betthur here yit. I’ve sould a power of
different things in the sthreets, but I’m off for
counthry work now. I have a few therrays left
if your honour wants such a thing. I first sould
a few for a man I lodged along wid in Kent-street,
when he was sick, and so I got to know the
therrade. He tould me to say, and it’s the
therruth, if anybody said, ‘They’re only second-hand,’
that they was all the betthur for that, for
if they hadn’t been real good therrays at first,
they would niver have lived to be second-hand ones.
I calls the bigghur therrays butlers, and the
smhaller, waithers. It’s a poor therrade. One
woman’ll say, ‘Pooh! ould-fashioned things.’
‘Will, thin, ma’am,’ I’ll say, ‘a good thing like
this is niver ould-fashioned, no more than the
bhutiful mate and berrid, and the bhutiful new
praties a coming in, that you’ll be atin off of it,
and thratin’ your husband to, God save him. No
lady iver goes to supper widout her therray.’
Yes, indeed, thin, and it is a poor therrade. It’s
the bhutiful therrays I’ve sould for 6<i>d.</i> I buys
them of a shop which dales in sich things. The
perrofit! Sorry a perrofit is there in it at all at
all; but I thries to make 4<i>d.</i> out of 1<i>s.</i> If I
makes 6<i>d.</i> of a night it’s good worruk.”</p>

<p>These trays are usually carried under the arm,
and are sometimes piled on a stool or small
stand, in a street market. The prices are from
2<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>, sometimes 1<i>s.</i> The stronger descriptions
are sold to street-sellers to display their
goods upon, as much as to any other class. Women
and children occasionally sell them, but it
is one of the callings which seems to be disappearing
from the streets. From two men, who
were familiar with this and other second-hand
trades, I heard the following reasons assigned for
the decadence. One man thought it was owing to
“swag-trays” being got up so common and so
cheap, but to look “stunning well,” at least as
long as the shininess lasted. The other contended
that poor working people had enough to do now-a-days
to get something to eat, without thinking
of a tray to put it on.</p>

<p>If 20 persons, and that I am told is about the
number of sellers, take in the one or two nights’
sale 4<i>s.</i> a week each, on second-hand trays (33 per
cent. being the rate of profit), the street expenditure
is 208<i>l.</i> in a year.</p>

<p>In other second-hand metal articles there is
now and then a separate trade. Two or three
sets of small <i>fire-irons</i> may be offered in a street-market
on a Saturday night; or a small stock of
<i>flat and Italian irons</i> for the laundresses, who
work cheap and must buy second-hand; or a
<i>collection of tools</i> in the same way; but these are
accidental sales, and are but ramifications from the
general “old metal” trade that I have described.
Perhaps, in the sale of these second-hand articles,
20 people may be regularly employed, and 300<i>l.</i>
yearly may be taken.</p>

<p>In Petticoat-lane, Rosemary-lane, Whitecross-street,
Ratcliff-highway, and in the street-markets
generally, are to be seen men, women, and
children selling <i>dinner knives and forks, razors,
pocket-knives, and scissors</i>. The pocket-knives
and scissors are kept well oiled, so that the weather
does not rust them. These goods have been
mostly repaired, ground, and polished for street-commerce.
The women and children selling these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
articles are the wives and families of the men
who repair, grind, and polish them, and who
belong, correctly speaking, to the class of street-artizans,
under which head they will be more
particularly treated of. It is the same also with
the street-vendors of second-hand tin saucepans
and other vessels (a trade, by the way, which is
rapidly decreasing), for these are generally made
of the old drums of machines retinned, or are old
saucepans and pots mended for use by the vendors,
who are mostly working tinmen, and appertain
to the artizan class.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-Hand
Linen</span>, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>I now come to the second variety of the several
kinds of street-sellers of second-hand articles.
The accounts of the street-trade in second-hand
linens, however, need be but brief; for none of
the callings I have now to notice supply a mode of
subsistence to the street-sellers independently of
other pursuits. They are resorted to whenever
an opportunity or a prospect of remuneration
presents itself by the class of general street-sellers,
women as well as men&mdash;the women being the
most numerous. The sale of these articles is on
the Saturday and Monday nights, in the street-markets,
and daily in Petticoat and Rosemary
lanes.</p>

<p>One of the most saleable of all the second-hand
textile commodities of the streets, is an article the
demand for which is certainly creditable to the
poorer and the working-classes of London&mdash;<i>towels</i>.
The principal supply of this street-towelling
is obtained from the several barracks in and
near London. They are a portion of what were
the sheets (of strong linen) of the soldiers’ beds,
which are periodically renewed, and the old sheeting
is then sold to a contractor, of whom the
street-folk buy it, and wash and prepare it for
market. It is sold to the street-traders at 4<i>d.</i> per
pound, 1 lb. making eight penny towels; some (inferior)
is as low as 2<i>d.</i> The principal demand is
by the working-classes.</p>

<p>“Why, for one time, sir,” said a street-seller
to me, “there wasn’t much towelling in the
streets, and I got a tidy lot, just when I knew
it would go off, like a thief round a corner. I
pitched in Whitecross-street, and not far from a
woman that was making a great noise, and had a
good lot of people about her, for cheap mackarel
weren’t so very plenty then as they are now.
‘Here’s your cheap mack’rel,’ shouts she, ‘cheap,
cheap, cheap mac-mac-mac-<i>mack</i>’rel. Then <i>I</i> begins:
‘Here’s your cheap towelling; cheap, cheap,
cheap, tow-tow-tow-<i>tow</i>-ellings. Here’s towels a
penny a piece, and two for twopence, or a double
family towel for twopence.’ I soon had a greater
crowd than she had. O, yes! I gives ’em a good
history of what I has to sell; patters, as you call
it; a man that can’t isn’t fit for the streets.
‘Here’s what every wife should buy for her husband,
and every husband for his wife,’ I goes on.
‘Domestic happiness is then secured. If a husband
licks his wife, or a wife licks her husband, a
towel is the handiest and most innocent thing it
can be done with, and if it’s wet it gives you a
strong clipper on the cheek, as every respectable
married person knows as well as I do. A clipper
that way always does me good, and I’m satisfied
it does more good to a gentleman than a lady.’
Always patter for the women, sir, if you wants to
sell. Yes, towels is good sale in London, but I
prefer country business. I’m three times as much
in the country as in town, and I’m just off to
Ascot to sell cards, and do a little singing, and
then I’ll perhaps take a round to Bath and Bristol,
but Bath’s not what it was once.”</p>

<p>Another street-seller told me that, as far as his
experience went, Monday night was a better time
for the sale of second-hand sheetings, &amp;c., than
Saturday, as on Monday the wives of the working-classes
who sought to buy cheaply what was
needed for household use, usually went out to
make their purchases. The Saturday-night’s mart
is more one for immediate necessities, either for the
Sunday’s dinner or the Sunday’s wear. It appears
to me that in all these little distinctions&mdash;of which
street-folk tell you, quite unconscious that they
tell anything new&mdash;there is something of the history
of the character of a people.</p>

<p>“Wrappers,” or “bale-stuff,” as it is sometimes
styled, are also sold in the streets as second-hand
goods. These are what have formed the covers of
the packages of manufactures, and are bought
(most frequently by the Jews) at the wholesale
warehouses or the larger retail shops, and re-sold
to the street-people, usually at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> per
pound. These goods are sometimes sold entire,
but are far more often cut into suitable sizes for
towels, strong aprons, &amp;c. They soon get
“bleached,” I was told, by washing and wear.</p>

<p><i>“Burnt” linen or calico</i> is also sold in the
streets as a second-hand article. On the occasion
of a fire at any tradesman’s, whose stock of drapery
had been injured, the damaged wares are bought
by the Jewish or other keepers of the haberdashery
swag-shops. Some of these are sold by the second-hand
street dealers, but the traffic for such articles
is greater among the hawkers. Of this I have
already given an account. The street-sale of these
burnt (and sometimes <i>designedly</i> burnt) wares is
in pieces, generally from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, or in
yards, frequently at 6<i>d.</i> per yard, but of course
the price varies with the quality.</p>

<p>I believe that no <i>second-hand sheets</i> are sold in
the streets as sheets, for when tolerably good they
are received at the pawn-shops, and if indifferent,
at the dolly-shops, or illegal pawn-shops. Street
folk have told me of sheets being sold in the street-markets,
but so rarely as merely to supply an
exception. In Petticoat-lane, indeed, they are
sold, but it is mostly by the Jew shopkeepers,
who also expose their goods in the streets, and they
are sold by them very often to street-traders, who
convert them into other purposes.</p>

<p>The statistics of this trade present great difficulties.
The second-hand linen, &amp;c., is not a
regular street traffic. It may be offered to the
public 20 days or nights in a month, or not one.
If a “job-lot” have been secured, the second-hand
street-seller may confine himself to that especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
stock. If his means compel him to offer only a
paucity of second-hand goods, he may sell but one
kind. Generally, however, the same man or
woman trades in two, three, or more of the second-hand
textile productions which I have specified,
and it is hardly one street-seller out of 20, who if
he have cleared his 10<i>s.</i> in a given time, by vending
different articles, can tell the relative amount he
cleared on each. The trade is, therefore, irregular,
and is but a consequence, or&mdash;as one street-seller
very well expressed it&mdash;a “tail” of other trades.
For instance, if there has been a great auction of
any corn-merchant’s effects, there will be more sacking
than usual in the street-markets; if there have
been sales, beyond the average extent, of old
household furniture, there will be a more ample
street stock of curtains, carpeting, fringes, &amp;c. Of
the articles I have enumerated the sale of second-hand
linen, more especially that from the barrack-stores,
is the largest of any.</p>

<p>The most intelligent man whom I met with in
this trade calculated that there were 80 of these
second-hand street-folk plying their trade two
nights in the week; that they took 8<i>s.</i> each
weekly, about half of it being profit; thus the
street expenditure would be 1664<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand
Curtains.</span></h3>

<p>Second-Hand Curtains, but only good ones, I
was assured, can now be sold in the streets,
“because common new ones can be had so cheap.”
The “good second-hands,” however, sell readily.
The most saleable of all second-hand curtains are
those of chintz, especially old-fashioned chintz,
now a scarce article; the next in demand are
what were described to me as “good check,” or
the blue and white cotton curtains. White dimity
curtains, though now rarely seen in a street-market,
are not bought to be re-used as curtains&mdash;“there’s
too much washing about them for
London”&mdash;but for petticoats, the covering of large
pincushions, dressing-table covers, &amp;c., and for the
last-mentioned purpose they are bought by the
householders of a small tenement who let a “well-furnished”
bed-room or two.</p>

<p>The uses to which the second-hand chintz or
check curtains are put, are often for “Waterloo”
or “tent” beds. It is common for a single
woman, struggling to “get a decent roof over her
head,” or for a young couple wishing to improve
their comforts in furniture, to do so piece-meal.
An old bedstead of a better sort may first be purchased,
and so on to the concluding “decency,”
or, in the estimation of some poor persons, “dignity”
of curtains. These persons are customers
of the street-sellers&mdash;the second-hand curtains
costing them from 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Moreen curtains have also a good sale. They
are bought by working people (and by some of the
dealers in second-hand furniture) for the re-covering
of sofas, which had become ragged, the deficiency
of stuffing being supplied with hay (which
is likewise the “stuffing” of the new sofas sold
by the “linen-drapers,” or “slaughter-houses”).
Moreen curtains, too, are sometimes cut into pieces,
for the re-covering of old horse-hair chairs, for
which purpose they are sold at 3<i>d.</i> each piece.</p>

<p>Second-hand curtains are moreover cut into portions
and sold for the hanging of the testers of
bedsteads, but almost entirely for what the street-sellers
call “half-teesters.” These are required
for the Waterloo bedsteads, “and if it’s a nice
thing, sir,” said one woman, “and perticler if it’s
a chintz, and to be had for 6<i>d.</i>, the women’ll
fight for it.”</p>

<p>The second-hand curtains, when sold entire, are
from 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> One man had lately sold a
pair of “good moreens, only faded, but dyeing’s
cheap,” for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand Carpeting,
Flannels, Stocking-legs</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</h3>

<p>I class these second-hand wares together, as they
are all of woollen materials.</p>

<p><i>Carpeting</i> has a fair sale, and in the streets is
vended not as an entire floor or stair-carpet, but in
pieces. The floor-carpet pieces are from 2<i>d.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> each; the stair-carpet pieces are from 1<i>d.</i> to
4<i>d.</i> a yard. Hearth-rugs are very rarely offered
to street-customers, but when offered are sold from
4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> Drugget is also sold in the same way
as the floor-carpeting, and sometimes for house-scouring
cloths.</p>

<p>“I’ve sold carpet, sir,” said a woman street-seller,
who called all descriptions&mdash;rugs and
drugget too&mdash;by that title; “and I would like to
sell it regular, but my old man&mdash;he buys everything&mdash;says
it can’t be had regular. I’ve sold
many things in the streets, but I’d rather sell good
second-hand in carpet or curtains, or fur in winter,
than anything else. They’re nicer people as buys
them. It would be a good business if it was
regular. Ah! indeed, in my time, and before I
was married, I have sold different things in a
different way; but I’d rather not talk about that,
and I make no complaints, for seeing what I see.
I’m not so badly off. Them as buys carpet are
very particular&mdash;I’ve known them take a tape
out of their pockets and measure&mdash;but they’re
honourable customers. If they’re satisfied they
buy, most of them does, at once; without any of
your ‘is that the lowest?’ as ladies asks in shops,
and that when they don’t think of buying, either.
Carpet is bought by working people, and they use
it for hearth-rugs, and for bed-sides, and such like.
I know it by what I’ve heard them say when I’ve
been selling. One Monday evening, five or six
years back, I took 10<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> in carpet; there had
been some great sales at old houses, and a good
quantity of carpet and curtains was sold in the
streets. Perhaps I cleared 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on that 10<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
But to take 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> is good work now, and often
not more than 3<i>d.</i> in the 1<i>s.</i> profit. Still, it’s
a pretty good business, when you can get a stock
of second-hands of different kinds to keep you
going constantly.”</p>

<p>What in the street-trade is known as “<i>Flannels</i>,”
is for the most part second-hand blankets, which
having been worn as bed furniture, and then very
probably, or at the same time, used for ironing
cloths, are found in the street-markets, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they are purchased for flannel petticoats for the
children of the poor, or when not good enough for
such use, for house cloths, at 1<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p>The trade in <i>stocking legs</i> is considerable. In
these legs the feet have been cut off, further darning
being impossible, and the fragment of the
stocking which is worth preserving is sold to the
careful housewives who attach to it a new foot.
Sometimes for winter wear a new cheap sock is
attached to the footless hose. These legs sell
from &frac12;<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> the pair, but very rarely 3<i>d.</i>, and
only when of the best quality, though the legs would
not be saleable in the streets at all, had they not
been of a good manufacture originally. Men’s hose
are sold in this way more largely than women’s.</p>

<p>The trade in second-hand stockings is very considerable,
but they form a part of the second-hand
apparel of street-commerce, and I shall notice
them under that head.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand Bed-ticking,
Sacking, Fringe</span>, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>For <i>bed-ticking</i> there is generally a ready sale,
but I was told “not near so ready as it was a dozen
year or more back.” One reason which I heard
assigned for this was, that new ticking was made
so cheap (being a thin common cotton, for the
lining of common carpet-bags, portmanteaus, &amp;c.),
that poor persons scrupled to give any equivalent
price for good sound second-hand linen bed-ticking,
“though,” said a dealer, “it’ll still wear out
half a dozen of their new slop rigs. I should
like a few of them there slop-masters, that’s
making fortins out of foolish or greedy folks, to
have to live a few weeks in the streets by this sort
of second-hand trade; they’d hear what was
thought of them then by all sensible people, which
aren’t so many as they should be by a precious
long sight.”</p>

<p>The ticking sold in the street is bought for the
patching of beds and for the making of pillows
and bolsters, and for these purposes is sold in
pieces at from 2<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> as the most frequent price.
One woman who used to sell bed-ticking, but not
lately, told me that she knew poor women who
cared nothing for such convenience themselves,
buy ticking to make pillows for their children.</p>

<p><i>Second-hand Sacking</i> is sold without much difficulty
in the street-markets, and usually in pieces
at from 2<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> This sacking has been part of
a corn sack, or of the strong package in which
some kinds of goods are dispatched by sea or
railway. It is bought for the mending of bedstead
sacking, and for the making of porters’
knots, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Second-hand Fringe</i> is still in fair demand, but
though cheaper than ever, does not, I am assured,
“sell so well as when it was dearer.” Many of
my readers will have remarked, when they have
been passing the apartments occupied by the
working class, that the valance fixed from the
top of the window has its adornment of fringe; a
blind is sometimes adorned in a similar manner,
and so is the valance from the tester of a bedstead.
For such uses the second-hand fringe is bought in
the street-markets in pieces, sometimes called
“quantities,” of from 1<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>Second-hand Table-cloths</i> used to be an article
of street-traffic to some extent. If offered at all
now&mdash;and one man, though he was a regular
street-seller, thought he had not seen one offered
in a market this year&mdash;they are worn things such
as will not be taken by the pawnbrokers, while
the dolly-shop people would advance no more
than the table-cloth might be worth for the rag-bag.
<i>The glazed table-covers</i>, now in such
general use, are not as yet sold second-hand in the
streets.</p>

<p>I was told by a street-seller that he had heard
an old man (since dead), who was a buyer of
second-hand goods, say that in the old times, after
a great sale by auction&mdash;as at Wanstead-house
(Mr. Wellesley Pole’s), about 30 years ago&mdash;the
open-air trade was very brisk, as the street-sellers,
like the shop-traders, proclaimed all their second-hand
wares as having been bought at “the great
sale.” For some years no such “<i>ruse</i>” has been
practised by street-folk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-Hand
Glass and Crockery.</span></h3>

<p>These sellers are another class who are fast disappearing
from the streets of London. Before
glass and crockery, but more especially glass,
became so low-priced when new, the second-hand
glass-man was one of the most prosperous of the
open-air traders; he is now so much the reverse
that he must generally mix up some other calling
with his original business. One man, whose
address was given to me as an experienced glass-man,
I found selling mackarel and “pound
crabs,” and complaining bitterly that mackarel
were high, and that he could make nothing out
of them that week at 2<i>d.</i> each, for poor persons,
he told me, would not give more. “Yes, sir,” he
said, “I’ve been in most trades, besides having
been a pot-boy, both boy and man, and I don’t
like this fish-trade at all. I could get a pot-boy’s
place again, but I’m not so strong as I were, and
it’s slavish work in the place I could get; and a
man that’s not so young as he was once is
chaffed so by the young lads and fellows in the
tap-room and the skittle-ground. For this last
three year or more I had to do something in addition
to my glass for a crust. Before I dropped
it as a bad consarn, I sold old shoes as well
as old glass, and made both ends meet that way,
a leather end and a glass end. I sold off my
glass to a rag and bottle shop for 9<i>s.</i>, far less than
it were worth, and I swopped my shoes for my
fish-stall, and water-tub, and 3<i>s.</i> in money. I’ll
be out of this trade before long. The glass was
good once; I’ve made my 15<i>s.</i> and 20<i>s.</i> a week
at it: I don’t know how long that is ago, but it’s
a good long time. Latterly I could do no business
at all in it, or hardly any. The old shoes
was middling, because they’re a free-selling thing,
but somehow it seems awkward mixing up any
other trade with your glass.”</p>

<p>The stall or barrow of a “second-hand glass-man”
presented, and still, in a smaller degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
presents, a variety of articles, and a variety of
colours, but over the whole prevails that haziness
which seems to be considered proper to this trade.
Even in the largest rag and bottle shops, the
second-hand bottles always look dingy. “It
wouldn’t pay to wash them all,” said one shopkeeper
to me, “so we washes none; indeed, I
b’lieve people would rather buy them as they is,
and clean them themselves.”</p>

<p>The street-assortment of second-hand glass may
be described as one of “odds and ends”&mdash;odd
goblets, odd wine-glasses, odd decanters, odd cruet-bottles,
salt-cellars, and mustard-pots; together
with a variety of “tops” to fit mustard-pots or
butter-glasses, and of “stoppers” to fit any sized
bottle, the latter articles being generally the most
profitable. Occasionally may still be seen a blue
spirit-decanter, one of a set of three, with “brandy,”
in faded gold letters, upon it, or a brass or plated
label, as dingy as the bottle, hung by a fine wire-chain
round the neck. Blue finger-glasses sold
very well for use as sugar-basins to the wives of
the better-off working-people or small tradesmen.
One man, apparently about 40, who had been in
this trade in his youth, and whom I questioned as
to what was the quality of his stock, told me of
the demand for “blue sugars,” and pointed out to
me one which happened to be on a stand by the
door of a rag and bottle shop. When I mentioned its
original use, he asked further about it, and after my
answers seemed sceptical on the subject. “People
that’s quality,” he said, “that’s my notion on it,
that hasn’t neither to yarn their dinner, nor to
cook it, but just open their mouths and eat it, can’t
dirty their hands so at dinner as to have glasses to
wash ’em in arterards. But there’s queer ways
everywhere.”</p>

<p>At one time what were called “doctors’ bottles”
formed a portion of the second-hand stock I am
describing. These were phials bought by the poorer
people, in which to obtain some physician’s gratuitous
prescription from the chemist’s shop, or the time-honoured
nostrum of some wonderful old woman.
For a very long period, it must be borne in mind,
all kinds of glass wares were dear. Small glass
frames, to cover flower-roots, were also sold
at these stalls, as were fragments of looking-glass.
Beneath his stall or barrow, the “old glass-man”
often had a few old wine or beer-bottles for sale.</p>

<p>At the period before cast-glass was so common,
and, indeed, subsequently, until glass became
cheap, it was not unusual to see at the second-hand
stalls, rich cut-glass vessels which had been
broken and cemented, for sale at a low figure, the
glass-man being often a mender. It was the same
with China punch-bowls, and the costlier kind of
dishes, but this part of the trade is now unknown.</p>

<p>There is one curious sort of ornament still to be
met with at these stalls&mdash;wide-mouthed bottles,
embellished with coloured patterns of flowers,
birds, &amp;c., generally cut from “furniture prints,”
and kept close against the sides of the interior by
the salt with which the bottles are filled. A
few second-hand pitchers, teapots, &amp;c., are still
sold at from 1<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>There are now not above six men (of the ordinary
street-selling class) who carry on this trade
regularly. Sometimes twelve stalls or barrows
may be seen; sometimes one, and sometimes none.
Calculating that each of the six dealers takes 12<i>s.</i>
weekly, with a profit of 6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i>, we find 187<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>
expended in this department of street-commerce.
The principal place for the trade is in High-street,
Whitechapel.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-Hand
Miscellaneous Articles.</span></h3>

<p>I have in a former page specified some of the
goods which make up the sum of the second-hand
miscellaneous commerce of the streets of London.</p>

<p>I may premise that the trader of this class is a
sort of street broker; and it is no more possible
minutely to detail his especial traffic in the several
articles of his stock, than it would be to give a specific
account of each and several of the “sundries”
to be found in the closets or corners of an old-furniture
broker’s or marine-store seller’s premises, in
describing his general business.</p>

<p>The members of this trade (as will be shown in
the subsequent statements) are also “miscellaneous”
in their character. A few have known
liberal educations, and have been established in
liberal professions; others have been artisans or
shopkeepers, but the mass are of the general class
of street-sellers.</p>

<p>I will first treat of the <i>Second-Hand Street-Sellers
of Articles for Amusement</i>, giving a wide
interpretation to the word “amusement.”</p>

<p>The backgammon, chess, draught, and cribbage-boards
of the second-hand trade have originally
been of good quality&mdash;some indeed of a very
superior manufacture; otherwise the “cheap
Germans” (as I heard the low-priced foreign goods
from the swag-shops called) would by their superior
cheapness have rendered the business a nullity.
The backgammon-boards are bought of brokers,
when they are often in a worn, unhinged, and
what may be called ragged condition. The
street-seller “trims them up,” but in this there
is nothing of artisanship, although it requires
some little taste and some dexterity of finger. A
new hinge or two, or old hinges re-screwed, and a
little pasting of leather and sometimes the application
of strips of bookbinder’s gold, is all that is
required. The backgammon-boards are sometimes
offered in the streets by an itinerant; sometimes
(and more frequently than otherwise in a
deplorable state, the points of the table being
hardly distinguishable) they are part of the furniture
of a second-hand stall. I have seen one at
an old book-stall, but most usually they are
vended by being hawked to the better sort of
public-houses, and there they are more frequently
disposed of by raffle than by sale. It is not once
in a thousand times, I am informed, that second-hand
“men” are sold with the board. Before the
board has gone through its series of hands to the
street-seller, the men have been lost or scattered.
New men are sometimes sold or raffled with the
backgammon-boards (as with the draught) at from
6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the set, the best being of box-wood.</p>

<p>Chess-boards and men&mdash;for without the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
course a draught, or the top of a backgammon-board
suffices for chess&mdash;are a commodity
now rarely at the disposal of the street-sellers;
and, as these means of a leisurely and abstruse
amusement are not of a ready sale, the second-hand
dealers do not “look out” for them, but
merely speculate in them when the article “falls
in their way” and seems a palpable bargain.
Occasionally, a second-hand chess apparatus is
still sold by the street-folk. One man&mdash;upon
whose veracity I have every reason to rely&mdash;told
me that he once sold a beautiful set of ivory men
and a handsome “leather board” (second-hand)
to a gentleman who accosted him as he saw him
carry them along the street for sale, inviting him
to step in doors, when the gentleman’s residence
was reached. The chess-men were then arranged
and examined, and the seller asked 3<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> for
them, at once closing with the offer of 3<i>l.</i>; “for
I found, sir,” he said, “I had a gentleman to do
with, for he told me he thought they were really
cheap at 3<i>l.</i>, and he would give me that.” Another
dealer in second-hand articles, when I asked him
if he had ever sold chess-boards and men, replied,
“Only twice, sir, and then at 4<i>s.</i> and 5<i>s.</i> the set;
they was poor. I’ve seen chess played, and I
should say it’s a rum game; but I know nothing
about it. I once had a old gent for a customer,
and he was as nice and quiet a old gent as could
be, and I always called on him when I thought I
had a curus old tea-caddy, or knife-box, or anything
that way. He didn’t buy once in twenty
calls, but he always gave me something for my
trouble. He used to play at chess with another
old gent, and if, after his servant had told him
I’d come, I waited ’til I could wait no longer,
and then knocked at his room door, he swore like
a trooper.”</p>

<p>Draught-boards are sold at from 3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>
second-hand. Cribbage-boards, also second-hand,
and sometimes with cards, are only sold, I am informed,
when they are very bad, at from 1<i>d.</i> to
3<i>d.</i>, or very good, at from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> One
street-seller told me that he once sold a “Chinee”
cribbage-board for 18<i>s.</i>, which cost him 10<i>s.</i> “It
was a most beautiful thing,” he stated, “and was
very high-worked, and was inlaid with ivory, and
with green ivory too.”</p>

<p>The Dice required for the playing of backgammon,
or for any purpose, are bought of the waiters
at the club-houses, generally at 2<i>l.</i> the dozen sets.
They are retailed at about 25 per cent. profit.
Dice in this way are readily disposed of by the
street-people, as they are looked upon as “true,”
and are only about a sixth of the price they could
be obtained for new ones in the duly-stamped
covers. A few dice are sold at 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> the
set, but they are old and battered.</p>

<p>There are but two men who support themselves
wholly by the street-sale and the hawking of the
different boards, &amp;c., I have described. There
are two, three, or sometimes four occasional participants
in the trade. Of these one held a commission
in Her Majesty’s service, but was ruined
by gaming, and when unable to live by any other
means, he sells the implements with which he had
been but too familiar. “He lost everything in
Jermyn-street,” a man who was sometimes his
comrade in the sale of these articles said to me,
“but he is a very gentlemanly and respectable
man.”</p>

<p>The profits in this trade are very uncertain. A
man who was engaged in it told me that one
week he had cleared 2<i>l.</i>, and the next, with greater
pains-taking, did not sell a single thing.</p>

<p>The other articles which are a portion of the
second-hand miscellaneous trade of this nature are
sold as often, or more often, at stalls than elsewhere.
Dominoes, for instance, may be seen in
the winter, and they are offered only in the
winter, on perhaps 20 stalls. They are sold
at from 4<i>d.</i> a set, and I heard of one superior set
which were described to me as “brass-pinned,”
being sold in a handsome box for 5<i>s.</i>, the shop
price having been 15<i>s.</i> The great sale of dominoes
is at Christmas.</p>

<p>Pope-Joan boards, which, I was told, were
fifteen years ago sold readily in the streets, and
were examined closely by the purchasers (who
were mostly the wives of tradesmen), to see that
the print or paint announcing the partitions for
“intrigue,” “matrimony,” “friendship,” “Pope,”
&amp;c., were perfect, are now never, or rarely, seen.
Formerly the price was 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> In the
present year I could hear of but one man who
had even offered a Pope-board for sale in the
street, and he sold it, though almost new,
for 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“Fish,” or the bone, ivory, or mother-o’-pearl
card counters in the shape of fish, or sometimes
in a circular form, used to be sold second-hand as
freely as the Pope-boards, and are now as rarely to
be seen.</p>

<p>Until about 20 years ago, as well as I can fix
upon a term from the information I received, the
apparatus for a game known as the “Devil among
the tailors” was a portion of the miscellaneous
second-hand trade or hawking of the streets. In
it a top was set spinning on a long board, and
the result depended upon the number of men, or
“tailors,” knocked down by the “devil” (top)
of each player, these tailors being stationed,
numbered, and scored (when knocked down) in
the same way as when the balls are propelled into
the numbered sockets in a bagatelle-board. I am
moreover told that in the same second-hand calling
were boards known as “solitaire-boards.” These
were round boards, with a certain number of
holes, in each of which was a peg. One peg was
removed at the selection of the player, and the
game consisted in taking each remaining peg, by
advancing another over its head into any vacant
hole, and if at the end of the game only one peg
remained in the board, the player won; if winning
it could be called when the game could only be
played by one person, and was for “solitary”
amusement. Chinese puzzles, sometimes on a large
scale, were then also a part of the second-hand
traffic of the streets. These are a series of thin
woods in geometrical shapes, which may be fitted
into certain forms or patterns contained in a book,
or on a sheet. These puzzles are sold in the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
still, but in smaller quantity and diminished size.
Different games played with the teetotum were
also a part of second-hand street-sale, but none of
these bygone pastimes were vended to any
extent.</p>

<p>From the best data I have been able to obtain
it appears that the amount received by the street-sellers
or street-hawkers in the sale of these
second-hand articles of amusement is 10<i>l.</i> weekly,
about half being profit, divided in the proportions
I have intimated, as respects the number of street-sellers
and the periods of sale; or 520<i>l.</i> expended
yearly.</p>

<p>I should have stated that the principal customers
of this branch of second-hand traders are
found in the public-houses and at the cigar-shops,
where the goods are carried by street-sellers, who
hawk from place to place.</p>

<p>These dealers also attend the neighbouring, and,
frequently in the summer, the more distant races,
where for dice and the better quality of their
“boards,” &amp;c., they generally find a prompt
market. The sale at the fairs consists only of the
lowest-priced goods, and in a very scant proportion
compared to the races.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand
Musical Instruments.</span></h3>

<p>Of this trade there are two branches; the sale of
instruments which are really second-hand, and the
sale of those which are pretendedly so; in other
words, an honest and a dishonest business. As
in street estimation the whole is a second-hand
calling, I shall so deal with it.</p>

<p>At this season of the year, when fairs are
frequent and the river steamers with their bands
of music run oft and regularly, and out-door music
may be played until late, the calling of the street-musician
is “at its best.” In the winter he is
not unfrequently starving, especially if he be what
is called “a chance hand,” and have not the
privilege of playing in public-houses when the
weather renders it impossible to collect a street
audience. Such persons are often compelled to
part with their instruments, which they offer in
the streets or the public-houses, for the pawnbrokers
have been so often “stuck” (taken in)
with inferior instruments, that it is difficult to
pledge even a really good violin. With some of
these musical men it goes hard to part with their
instruments, as they have their full share of the
pride of art. Some, however, sell them recklessly
and at almost any price, to obtain the means of
prolonging a drunken carouse.</p>

<p>From a man who is now a dealer in second-hand
musical instruments, and is also a musician,
I had the following account of his start in the
second-hand trade, and of his feelings when he
first had to part with his fiddle.</p>

<p>“I was a gentleman’s footboy,” he said, “when
I was young, but I was always very fond of music,
and so was my father before me. He was a tailor
in a village in Suffolk and used to play the bass-fiddle
at church. I hardly know how or when I
learned to play, but I seemed to grow up to it.
There was two neighbours used to call at my
father’s and practise, and one or other was always
showing me something, and so I learned to play
very well. Everybody said so. Before I was
twelve, I’ve played nearly all night at a dance in
a farm-house. I never played on anything but
the violin. You must stick to one instrument, or
you’re not up to the mark on any if you keep
changing. When I got a place as footboy it was
in a gentleman’s family in the country, and I
never was so happy as when master and mistress
was out dining, and I could play to the servants
in the kitchen or the servants’ hall. Sometimes
they got up a bit of a dance to my violin. If
there was a dance at Christmas at any of the
tenants’, they often got leave for me to go and play.
It was very little money I got given, but too
much drink. At last master said, he hired me to
be his servant and not for a parish fiddler, so I
must drop it. I left him not long after&mdash;he got so
cross and snappish. In my next place&mdash;no, the
next but one&mdash;I was on board wages, in London,
a goodish bit, as the family were travelling, and
I had time on my hands, and used to go and play at
public-houses of a night, just for the amusement
of the company at first, but I soon got to know
other musicians and made a little money. Yes,
indeed, I could have saved money easily then,
but I didn’t; I got too fond of a public-house
life for that, and was never easy at home.”</p>

<p>I need not very closely pursue this man’s course
to the streets, but merely intimate it. He had
several places, remaining in some a year or more,
in others two, three, or six months, but always
unsettled. On leaving his last place he married a
fellow-servant, older than himself, who had saved
“a goodish bit of money,” and they took a beer-shop
in Bermondsey. A “free and easy” (concert),
both vocal and instrumental, was held in
the house, the man playing regularly, and the
business went on, not unprosperously, until the
wife died in child-bed, the child surviving. After
this everything went wrong, and at last the man
was “sold up,” and was penniless. For three or
four years he lived precariously on what he could
earn as a musician, until about six or seven years
ago, when one bitter winter’s night he was without
a farthing, and had laboured all day in the vain
endeavour to earn a meal. His son, a boy then of
five, had been sent home to him, and an old woman
with whom he had placed the lad was incessantly
dunning for 12<i>s.</i> due for the child’s maintenance.
The landlord clamoured for 15<i>s.</i> arrear of rent for
a furnished room, and the hapless musician did
not possess one thing which he could convert into
money except his fiddle. He must leave his room
next day. He had held no intercourse with his
friends in the country since he heard of his father’s
death some years before, and was, indeed, resourceless.
After dwelling on the many excellences of
his violin, which he had purchased, “a dead bargain,”
for 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>, he said: “Well, sir, I sat down
by the last bit of coal in the place, and sat a long
time thinking, and didn’t know what to do. There
was nothing to hinder me going out in the morning,
and working the streets with a mate, as I’d
done before, but then there was little James that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was sleeping there in his bed. He was very delicate
then, and to drag him about and let him
sleep in lodging-houses would have killed him, I
knew. But then I couldn’t think of parting with
my violin. I felt I should never again have such
another. I felt as if to part with it was parting with
my last prop, for what was I to do? I sat a long
time thinking, with my instrument on my knees,
’til&mdash;I’m sure I don’t know how to describe it&mdash;I
felt as if I was drunk, though I hadn’t even
tasted beer. So I went out boldly, just as if I
<i>was</i> drunk, and with a deal of trouble persuaded
a landlord I knew to lend me 1<i>l.</i> on my instrument,
and keep it by him for three months, ’til
I could redeem it. I have it now, sir. Next
day I satisfied my two creditors by paying each
half, and a week’s rent in advance, and I walked
off to a shop in Soho, where I bought a dirty old
instrument, broken in parts, for 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> I was
great part of the day in doing it up, and in the
evening earned 7<i>d.</i> by playing solos by Watchorn’s
door, and the Crown and Cushion, and the Lord
Rodney, which are all in the Westminster-road.
I lodged in Stangate-street. There was a young
man&mdash;he looked like a respectable mechanic&mdash;gave
me 1<i>d.</i>, and said: ‘I wonder how you can use
your fingers at all such a freezing night. It seems
a good fiddle.’ I assure you, sir, I was surprised
myself to find what I could do with my instrument.
‘There’s a beer-shop over the way,’ says
the young man, ‘step in, and I’ll pay for a pint,
and try my hand at it.’ And so it was done, and
I sold him my fiddle for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> No, sir, there
was no take in; it was worth the money. I’d
have sold it now that I’ve got a connection for
half a guinea. Next day I bought such another
instrument at the same shop for 3<i>s.</i>, and sold it
after a while for 6<i>s.</i>, having done it up, in course.
This it was that first put it into my head to
start selling second-hand instruments, and so I
began. Now I’m known as a man to be depended
on, and with my second-hand business, and engagements
every now and then as a musician, I do
middling.”</p>

<p>In this manner is the honest second-hand street-business
in musical instruments carried on. It is
usually done by hawking. A few, however, are sold
at miscellaneous stalls, but they are generally such
as require repair, and are often without the bow,
&amp;c. The persons carrying on the trade have all,
as far as I could ascertain, been musicians.</p>

<p>Of the street-sale of musical instruments by
drunken members of the “profession” I need say
little, as it is exceptional, though it is certainly a
branch of the trade, for so numerous is the body
of street-musicians, and of so many classes is it
composed, that this description of second-hand
business is being constantly transacted, and often
to the profit of the more wary dealers in these
goods. The statistics I shall show at the close of
my remarks on this subject.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Music “Duffers.”</span></h3>

<p>Second-Hand Guitars are vended by the
street-sellers. The price varies from 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>
<i>Harps</i> form no portion of the second-hand business
of the streets. A <i>drum</i> is occasionally, and only
occasionally, sold to a showman, but the chief
second-hand traffic is in violins. <i>Accordions</i>, both
new and old, used to sell readily in the streets,
either from stalls or in hawking, “but,” said a
man who had formerly sold them, “they have
been regularly ‘duffed’ out of the streets, so much
cheap rubbish is made to sell. There’s next to
nothing done in them now. If one’s offered to a
man that’s no judge of it, he’ll be sure you want
to cheat him, and perhaps abuse you; if he be a
judge, of course it’s no go, unless with a really
good article.”</p>

<p>Among the purchasers of second-hand musical
instruments are those of the working-classes who
wish to “practise,” and the great number of street-musicians,
street-showmen, and the indifferently
paid members of the orchestras of minor (and not
always of minor) theatres. Few of this class
ever buy new instruments. There are sometimes,
I am informed, as many as 50 persons, one-fourth
being women, engaged in this second-hand sale.
Sometimes, as at present, there are not above half
the number. A broker who was engaged in the
traffic estimated&mdash;and an intelligent street-seller
agreed in the computation&mdash;that, take the year
through, at least 25 individuals were regularly, but
few of them fully, occupied with this traffic, and
that their weekly takings averaged 30<i>s.</i> each, or an
aggregate yearly amount of 190<i>l.</i> The weekly
profits run from 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>, and sometimes the
well-known dealers clear 40<i>s.</i> or 50<i>s.</i> a week,
while others do not take 5<i>s.</i> Of this amount
about two-thirds is expended on violins, and one-tenth
of the whole, or nearly a tenth, on “duffing”
instruments sold as second-hand, in which department
of the business the amount “turned over”
used to be twice, and even thrice as much. The
sellers have nearly all been musicians in some
capacity, the women being the wives or connections
of the men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What I have called the “dishonest trade” is
known among the street-folk as “music-duffing.”
Among the swag-shopkeepers, at one place in
Houndsditch more especially, are dealers in
“duffing fiddles.” These are German-made instruments,
and are sold to the street-folk at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
or 3<i>s.</i> each, bow and all. When purchased by the
music-duffers, they are discoloured so as to be
made to look old. A music-duffer, assuming the
way of a man half-drunk, will enter a public-house
or accost any party in the street, saying:
“Here, I must have money, for I won’t go home
’til morning, ’til morning, ’til morning, I won’t go
home ’til morning, ’til daylight does appear. And
so I may as well sell my old fiddle myself as take
it to a rogue of a broker. Try it anybody, it’s a
fine old tone, equal to any Cremonar. It cost me
two guineas and another fiddle, and a good ’un too,
in exchange, but I may as well be my own broker,
for I must have money any how, and I’ll sell it
for 10<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>Possibly a bargain is struck for 5<i>s.</i>; for the
duffing violin is perhaps purposely damaged in
some slight way, so as to appear easily reparable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and any deficiency in tone may be attributed to
that defect, which was of course occasioned by the
drunkenness of the possessor. Or possibly the
tone of the instrument may not be bad, but it
may be made of such unsound materials, and in
such a slop-way, though looking well to a little-practised
eye, that it will soon fall to pieces. One
man told me that he had often done the music-duffing,
and had sold trash violins for 10<i>s.</i>, 15<i>s.</i>, and
even 20<i>s.</i>, “according,” he said, “to the thickness
of the buyer’s head,” but that was ten or twelve
years ago.</p>

<p>It appears that when an impetus was given to
the musical taste of the country by the establishment
of cheap singing schools, or of music classes,
(called at one time “singing for the million”), or
by the prevalence of cheap concerts, where good
music was heard, this duffing trade flourished,
but now, I am assured, it is not more than a
quarter of what it was. “There’ll always be something
done in it,” said the informant I have before
quoted, “as long as you can find young men
that’s conceited about their musical talents, fond
of taking their medicine (drinking). If I’ve
gone into a public-house room where I’ve seen a
young gent that’s bought a duffing fiddle of me,
it don’t happen once in twenty times that he complains
and blows up about it, and only then,
perhaps, if he happens to be drunkish, when people
don’t much mind what’s said, and so it does me no
harm. People’s too proud to confess that they’re
ever ‘done’ at any time or in anything. Why,
such gents has pretended, when I’ve sold ’em a
duffer, and seen them afterwards, that they’ve
done <i>me!</i>”</p>

<p>Nor is it to violins that this duffing or sham
second-hand trade is confined. At the swag-shops
<i>duffing cornopeans</i>, <i>French horns</i>, and <i>clarionets</i>
are vended to the street-folk. One of
these cornopeans may be bought for 14<i>s.</i>; a French
horn for 10<i>s.</i>; and a clarionet for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; or as a
general rule at one-fourth of the price of a properly-made
instrument sold as reasonably as
possible. These things are also made to look old,
and are disposed of in the same manner as the
duffing violins. The sale, however, is and was
always limited, for “if there be one working
man,” I was told, “or a man of any sort not professional
in music, that tries his wind and his
fingers on a clarionet, there’s a dozen trying their
touch and execution on a violin.”</p>

<p>Another way in which the duffing music trade
at one time was made available as a second-hand
business was this:&mdash;A band would play before a
pawnbroker’s door, and the duffing German brass
instruments might be well-toned enough, the inferiority
consisting chiefly in the materials, but
which were so polished up as to appear of the best.
Some member of the band would then offer his
brass instrument in pledge, and often obtain an
advance of more than he had paid for it.</p>

<p>One man who had been himself engaged in
what he called this “artful” business, told me
that when two pawnbrokers, whom he knew,
found that they had been tricked into advancing
15<i>s.</i> on cornopeans, which they could buy new in
Houndsditch for 14<i>s.</i>, they got him to drop the
tickets of the pledge, which they drew out for the
purpose, in the streets. These were picked up by
some passer-by&mdash;and as there is a very common
feeling that there is no harm, or indeed rather a
merit, in cheating a pawnbroker or a tax-gatherer&mdash;the
instruments were soon redeemed by the fortunate
finder, or the person to whom he had disposed
of his prize. Nor did the roguery end here. The
same man told me that he had, in collusion with a
pawnbroker, dropped tickets of (sham) second-hand
musical instruments, which he had bought new at
a swag-shop for the very purpose, the amount on
the duplicate being double the cost, and as it is
known that the pawnbrokers do not advance the
value of any article, the finders were gulled into
redeeming the pledge, as an advantageous bargain.
“But I’ve left off all that dodging now,
sir,” said the man with a sort of a grunt, which
seemed half a sigh and half a laugh; “I’ve left
it off entirely, for I found I was getting into
trouble.”</p>

<p>The derivation of the term “duffing” I am unable
to discover. The Rev. Mr. Dixon says, in
his “Dovecote and Aviary,” that the term
“<i>Duffer</i>,” applied to pigeons, is a corruption of
<i>Dovehouse</i>,&mdash;but <i>query</i>? In the slang dictionaries
a “<i>Duffer</i>” is explained as “a man who hawks
things;” hence it would be equivalent to <i>Pedlar</i>,
which means strictly beggar&mdash;being from the
Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bedclaar</i>, and the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bettler</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-Hand
Weapons.</span></h3>

<p>The sale of second-hand pistols, for to that weapon
the street-sellers’ or hawkers’ trade in arms seems
confined, is larger than might be cursorily imagined.</p>

<p>There must be something seductive about the
possession of a pistol, for I am assured by persons
familiar with the trade, that they have sold them
to men who were ignorant, when first invited to
purchase, how the weapon was loaded or discharged,
and seemed half afraid to handle it.
Perhaps the possession imparts a sense of security.</p>

<p>The pistols which are sometimes seen on the
street-stalls are almost always old, rusted, or battered,
and are useless to any one except to those
who can repair and clean them for sale.</p>

<p>There are three men now selling new or second-hand
pistols, I am told, who have been gunmakers.</p>

<p>This trade is carried on almost entirely by
hawking to public-houses. I heard of no one
who depended solely upon it, “but this is the
way,” one intelligent man stated to me, “if I am
buying second-hand things at a broker’s, or in
Petticoat-lane, or anywhere, and there’s a pistol
that seems cheap, I’ll buy it as readily as anything
I know, and I’ll soon sell it at a public-house,
or I’ll get it raffled for. Second-hand pistols
sell better than new by such as me. If I was
to offer a new one I should be told it was some
Brummagem slop rubbish. If there’s a little
silver-plate let into the wood of the pistol, and a
crest or initials engraved on it&mdash;I’ve got it done
sometimes&mdash;there’s a better chance of sale, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
people think it’s been made for somebody of consequence
that wouldn’t be fobbed off with an inferior
thing. I don’t think I’ve often sold pistols
to working-men, but I’ve known them join in
raffles for them, and the winner has often wanted
to sell it back to me, and has sold it to somebody.
It’s tradesmen that buy, or gentlefolks, if you can
get at them. A pistol’s a sort of a plaything with
them.”</p>

<p>On my talking with a street-dealer concerning
the street-trade in second-hand pistols, he produced
a handsome pistol from his pocket. I inquired
if it was customary for men in his way
of life to carry pistols, and he expressed his
conviction that it was, but only when travelling
in the country, and in possession of
money or valuable stock. “I gave only 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for this pistol,” he said, “and have refused 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for it, for I shall get a better price, as it’s an excellent
article, on some of my rounds in town. I
bought it to take to Ascot races with me, and have
it with me now, but it’s not loaded, for I’m going
to Moulsey Hurst, where Hampton races are
held. You’re not safe if you travel after a great
muster at a race by yourself without a pistol.
Many a poor fellow like me has been robbed, and
the public hear nothing about it, or say it’s all
gammon. At Ascot, sir, I trusted my money to a
booth-keeper I knew, as a few men slept in his
booth, and he put my bit of tin with his own
under his head where he slept, for safe keeping.
There’s a little doing in second-hand pistols to
such as me, but we generally sell them again.”</p>

<p>Of <i>second-hand guns</i>, or other offensive weapons,
there is no street sale. A few “<i>life-preservers</i>,”
some of gutta percha, are hawked, but they are
generally new. Bullets and powder are not sold
by the pistol-hawkers, but a <i>mould</i> for the casting
of bullets is frequently sold along with the weapon.</p>

<p>Of these second-hand pistol-sellers there are now,
I am told, more than there were last year. “I
really believe,” said one man, laughing, but I
heard a similar account from others, “people were
afraid the foreigners coming to the Great Exhibition
had some mischief in their noddles, and so a
pistol was wanted for protection. In my opinion,
a pistol’s just one of the things that people don’t
think of buying, ’til it’s shown to them, and then
they’re tempted to have it.”</p>

<p>The principal street-sale, independently of the
hawking to public-houses, is in such places as Ratcliffe-highway,
where the mates and petty officers
of ships are accosted and invited to buy a good
second-hand pistol. The wares thus vended are
generally of a well-made sort.</p>

<p>In this traffic, which is known as a “straggling”
trade, pursued by men who are at the same time
pursuing other street-callings, it may be estimated,
I am assured, that there are 20 men engaged,
each taking as an average 1<i>l.</i> a week. In some
weeks a man may take 5<i>l.</i>; in the next month he
may sell no weapons at all. From 30 to 50 per
cent. is the usual rate of profit, and the yearly
street outlay on these second-hand offensive or defensive
weapons is 1040<i>l.</i></p>

<p>One man who “did a little in pistols” told me,
“that 25 or 30 years ago, when he was a boy, his
father sometimes cleared 2<i>l.</i> a week in the street-sale
and hawking of second-hand <i>boxing-gloves</i>,
and that he himself had sometimes carried the
‘gloves’ in his hand, and pistols in his pocket for
sale, but that now boxing-gloves were in no demand
whatever among street-buyers, and were ‘a
complete drug.’ He used to sell them at 3<i>s.</i> the
set, which is four gloves.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand
Curiosities.</span></h3>

<p>Several of the things known in the street-trade
as “curiosities” can hardly be styled second-hand
with any propriety, but they are so styled in the
streets, and are usually vended by street-merchants
who trade in second-hand wares.</p>

<p>Curiosities are displayed, I cannot say temptingly
(except perhaps to a sanguine antiquarian),
for there is a great dinginess in the display, on
stalls. One man whom I met wheeling his barrow
in High-street, Camden-town, gave me an account
of his trade. He was dirtily rather than meanly
clad, and had a very self-satisfied expression of
face. The principal things on his barrow were
<i>coins</i>, <i>shells</i>, and <i>old buckles</i>, with a pair of the
very high and wooden-heeled <i>shoes</i>, worn in the
earlier part of the last century.</p>

<p>The coins were all of copper, and certainly did
not lack variety. Among them were tokens, but
none very old. There was the head of “Charles
Marquis Cornwallis” looking fierce in a cocked
hat, while on the reverse was Fame with her
trumpet and a wreath, and banners at her feet,
with the superscription: “His fame resounds
from east to west.” There was a head of Wellington
with the date 1811, and the legend of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vincit
amor patriæ</span>.” Also “The R. Hon. W. Pitt,
Lord Warden Cinque Ports,” looking courtly in a
bag wig, with his hair brushed from his brow into
what the curiosity-seller called a “topping.” This
was announced as a “Cinque Ports token payable
at Dover,” and was dated 1794. “Wellingtons,”
said the man, “is cheap; that one’s only a halfpenny,
but here’s one here, sir, as you seem to
understand coins, as I hope to get 2<i>d.</i> for, and will
take no less. It’s ‘J. Lackington, 1794,’ you
see, and on the back there’s a Fame, and round
her is written&mdash;and it’s a good speciment of a coin&mdash;‘Halfpenny
of Lackington, Allen &amp; Co.,
cheapest booksellers in the world.’ That’s scarcer
and more vallyballer than Wellingtons or Nelsons
either.” Of the current coin of the realm, I saw
none older than Charles II., and but one of his
reign, and little legible. Indeed the reverse had
been ground quite smooth, and some one had engraved
upon it “Charles Dryland Tunbridg.” A
small “e” over the “g” of Tunbridg perfected
the orthography. This, the street-seller said, was
a “love-token” as well as an old coin, and “them
love-tokens was getting scarce.” Of foreign and
colonial coins there were perhaps 60. The oldest
I saw was one of Louis XV. of France and Navarre,
1774. There was one also of the “Republique
Francaise” when Napoleon was First
Consul. The colonial coins were more numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
than the foreign. There was the “One Penny
token” of Lower Canada; the “one quarter
anna” of the East India Company; the “half
stiver of the colonies of Essequibo and Demarara;”
the “halfpenny token of the province of
Nova Scotia,” &amp;c. &amp;c. There were also counterfeit
halfcrowns and bank tokens worn from their
simulated silver to rank copper. The principle
on which this man “priced” his coins, as he
called it, was simple enough. What was the
size of a halfpenny he asked a penny for; the size
of a penny coin was 2<i>d.</i> “It’s a difficult trade
is mine, sir,” he said, “to carry on properly, for
you may be so easily taken in, if you’re not a
judge of coins and other curiosities.”</p>

<p>The shells of this man’s stock in trade he called
“conks” and “king conks.” He had no “clamps”
then, he told me, but they sold pretty well; he
described them as “two shells together, one fitting
inside the other.” He also had sold what he called
“African cowries,” which were as “big as a pint
pot,” and the smaller cowries, which were “money
in India, for his father was a soldier and had been
there and saw it.” The shells are sold from 1<i>d.</i>
to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The old buckles were such as used to be worn
on shoes, but the plate was all worn off, and
“such like curiosities,” the man told me, “got
scarcer and scarcer.”</p>

<p>Many of the stalls which are seen in the
streets are the property of adjacent shop or store-keepers,
and there are not now, I am informed,
more than six men who carry on this trade apart
from other commerce. Their average takings are
15<i>s.</i> weekly each man, about two-thirds being
profit, or 234<i>l.</i> in a year. Some of the stands
are in Great Wyld-street, but they are chiefly the
property of the second-hand furniture brokers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand
Telescopes and Pocket Glasses.</span></h3>

<p>In the sale of second-hand telescopes only one
man is now engaged in any extensive way, except
on mere chance occasions. Fourteen or fifteen
years ago, I was informed, there was a considerable
street sale in small telescopes at 1<i>s.</i> each.
They were made at Birmingham, my informant
believed, but were sold as second-hand goods in
London. Of this trade there is now no remains.</p>

<p>The principal seller of second-hand telescopes
takes a stand on Tower Hill or by the Coal
Exchange, and his customers, as he sells excellent
“glasses,” are mostly sea-faring men. He has sold,
and still sells, telescopes from 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to 5<i>l.</i> each,
the purchasers generally “trying” them, with
strict examination, from Tower Hill, or on the
Custom-House Quay. There are, in addition to
this street-seller, six and sometimes eight others,
who offer telescopes to persons about the docks or
wharfs, who may be going some voyage. These
are as often new as second-hand, but the second-hand
articles are preferred. This, however, is
a Jewish trade which will be treated of under
another head.</p>

<p>An old opera-glass, or the smaller articles best
known as “pocket-glasses,” are occasionally
hawked to public-houses and offered in the streets,
but so little is done in them that I can obtain
no statistics. A spectacle seller told me that he
had once tried to sell two second-hand opera-glasses
at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, in the street, and then in
the public-houses, but was laughed at by the
people who were usually his customers. “Opera-glasses!”
they said, “why, what did they want
with opera-glasses? wait until they had opera-boxes.”
He sold the glasses at last to a shopkeeper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of other Miscellaneous
Second-Hand Articles.</span></h3>

<p>The other second-hand articles sold in the streets
I will give under one head, specifying the different
characteristics of the trade, when any striking
peculiarities exist. To give a detail of the whole
trade, or rather of the several kinds of articles in
the whole trade, is impossible. I shall therefore
select only such as are sold the more extensively,
or present any novel or curious features of second-hand
street-commerce.</p>

<p><i>Writing-desks</i>, <i>tea-caddies</i>, <i>dressing-cases</i>, and
<i>knife-boxes</i> used to be a ready sale, I was informed,
when “good second-hand;” but they are
“got up” now so cheaply by the poor fancy cabinet-makers
who work for the “slaughterers,” or furniture
warehouses, and for some of the general-dealing
swag-shops, that the sale of anything
second-hand is greatly diminished. In fact I was
told that as regards second-hand writing-desks and
dressing-cases, it might be said there was “no
trade at all now.” A few, however, are still to
be seen at miscellaneous stalls, and are occasionally,
but very rarely, offered at a public-house
“used” by artisans who may be considered
“judges” of work. The tea-caddies are the things
which are in best demand. “Working people buy
them,” I was informed, and “working people’s
wives. When women are the customers they look
closely at the lock and key, as they keep ‘my
uncle’s cards’ there” (pawnbroker’s duplicates).</p>

<p>One man had lately sold second-hand tea-caddies
at 9<i>d.</i>, 1<i>s.</i>, and 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> each, and cleared
2<i>s.</i> in a day when he had stock and devoted his
time to this sale. He could not persevere in it if
he wished, he told me, as he might lose a day in
looking out for the caddies; he might go to fifty
brokers and not find one caddy cheap enough for
his purpose.</p>

<p><i>Brushes</i> are sold second-hand in considerable
quantities in the streets, and are usually vended
at stalls. Shoe-brushes are in the best demand,
and are generally sold, when in good condition, at
1<i>s.</i> the set, the cost to the street-seller being 8<i>d.</i>
They are bought, I was told, by the people who
clean their own shoes, or have to clean other
people’s. Clothes’ brushes are not sold to any
extent, as the “hard brush” of the shoe set is used
by working people for a clothes’ brush. Of late,
I am told, second-hand brushes have sold more
freely than ever. They were hardly to be had
just when wanted, in a sufficient quantity, for the
demand by persons going to Epsom and Ascot
races, who carry a brush of little value with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to brush the dust gathered on the road from their
coats. The coster-girls buy very hard brushes,
indeed mere stumps, with which they brush
radishes; these brushes are vended at the street-stalls
at 1<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p>In <i>Stuffed Birds</i> for the embellishment of the
walls of a room, there is still a small second-hand
street sale, but none now in images or chimney-piece
ornaments. “Why,” said one dealer, “I can now
buy new figures for 9<i>d.</i>, such as not many years
ago cost 7<i>s.</i>, so what chance of a second-hand
sale is there?” The stuffed birds which sell the
best are starlings. They are all sold as second-hand,
but are often “made up” for street-traffic;
an old bird or two, I was told, in a new case, or a
new bird in an old case. Last Saturday evening
one man told me he had sold two “long cases” of
starlings and small birds for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each. There
are no stuffed parrots or foreign birds in this sale,
and no pheasants or other game, except sometimes
wretched old things which are sold because they
happen to be in a case.</p>

<p>The street-trade in second-hand <i>Lasts</i> is confined
principally to Petticoat and Rosemary lanes, where
they are bought by the “garret-masters” in
the shoemaking trade who supply the large wholesale
warehouses; that is to say, by small masters
who find their own materials and sell the boots
and shoes by the dozen pairs. The lasts are
bought also by mechanics, street-sellers, and other
poor persons who cobble their own shoes. A
shoemaker told me that he occasionally bought
a last at a street stall, or rather from street
hampers in Petticoat and Rosemary lanes, and it
seemed to him that second-hand stores of street
lasts got neither bigger nor smaller: “I suppose
it’s this way,” he reasoned; “the garret-master
buys lasts to do the slop-snobbing cheap, mostly
women’s lasts, and he dies or is done up and goes
to the “great house,” and his lasts find their way
back to the streets. You notice, sir, the first time
you’re in Rosemary-lane, how little a great many
of the lasts have been used, and that shows what
a terrible necessity there was to part with them.
In some there’s hardly any peg-marks at all.”
The lasts are sold from 1<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> each, or twice
that amount in pairs, “rights and lefts,” according
to the size and the condition. There are about
20 street last-sellers in the second-hand trade of
London&mdash;“at least 20,” one man said, after he
seemed to have been making a mental calculation
on the subject.</p>

<p><i>Second-hand harness</i> is sold largely, and when
good is sold very readily. There is, I am told,
far less slop-work in harness-making than in shoemaking
or in the other trades, such as tailoring,
and “many a lady’s pony harness,” it was said to
me by a second-hand dealer, “goes next to a
tradesman, and next to a costermonger’s donkey,
and if it’s been good leather to begin with&mdash;as
it will if it was made for a lady&mdash;why the traces’ll
stand clouting, and patching, and piecing, and
mending for a long time, and they’ll do to cobble
old boots last of all, for old leather’ll wear just
in treading, when it might snap at a pull. Give
me a good quality to begin with, sir, and it’s
serviceable to the end.” In my inquiries among
the costermongers I ascertained that if one of that
body started his donkey, or rose from that to his
pony, he never bought new harness, unless
it were a new collar if he had a regard for the
comfort of his beast, but bought old harness, and
“did it up” himself, often using iron rivets,
or clenched nails, to reunite the broken parts,
where, of course, a harness-maker would apply a
patch. Nor is it the costermongers alone who
buy all their harness second-hand. The sweep,
whose stock of soot is large enough to require the
help of an ass and a cart in its transport; the
collector of bones and offal from the butchers’
slaughter-houses or shops; and the many who
may be considered as co-traders with the costermonger
class&mdash;the greengrocer, the street coal-seller
by retail, the salt-sellers, the gravel and
sand dealer (a few have small carts)&mdash;all, indeed,
of that class of traders, buy their harness second-hand,
and generally in the streets. The chief sale
of second-hand harness is on the Friday afternoons,
in Smithfield. The more especial street-sale is in
Petticoat and Rosemary lanes, and in the many
off-streets and alleys which may be called the tributaries
to those great second-hand marts. There
is no sale of these wares in the Saturday night
markets, for in the crush and bustle generally
prevailing there at such times, no room could
be found for things requiring so much space as
sets of second-hand harness, and no time sufficiently
to examine them. “There’s so much to
look at, you understand, sir,” said one second-hand
street-trader, who did a little in harness
as well as in barrows, “if you wants a decent
set, and don’t grudge a shilling or two&mdash;and
I never grudges them myself when I has ’em&mdash;so
that it takes a little time. You must see that the
buckles has good tongues&mdash;and it’s a sort of joke
in the trade that a bad tongue’s a <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> bad
thing&mdash;and that the pannel of the pad ain’t as
hard as a board (flocks is the best stuffing, sir),
and that the bit, if it’s rusty, can be polished up,
for a animal no more likes a rusty bit in his
mouth than we likes a musty bit of bread in
our’n. O, a man as treats his ass as a ass
ought to be treated&mdash;and it’s just the same if he
has a pony&mdash;can’t be too perticler. If I had my
way I’d ’act a law making people perticler about
’osses’ and asses’ shoes. If your boot pinches you,
sir, you can sing out to your bootmaker, but a ass
can’t blow up a farrier.” It seems to me that in
these homely remarks of my informant, there is,
so to speak, a sound practical kindliness. There
can be little doubt that a fellow who maltreats his
ass or his dog, maltreats his wife and children
when he dares.</p>

<p><i>Clocks</i> are sold second-hand, but only by three
or four foreigners, Dutchmen or Germans, who
hawk them and sell them at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i>
each, Dutch clocks only being disposed of in this
way. These traders, therefore, come under the
head of <span class="smcap">Street-Foreigners</span>. “Ay,” one street-seller
remarked to me, “it’s only Dutch now as
is second-handed in the streets, but it’ll soon be
Americans. The swags is some of them hung up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with Slick’s;” [so he called the American clocks,
meaning the “Sam <i>Slicks</i>,” in reference to Mr.
Justice Hallyburton’s work of that title;] “they’re
hung up with ’em, sir, and no relation whatsomever
(pawnbroker) ’ll give a printed character of ’em
(a duplicate), and so they must come to the streets,
and jolly cheap they’ll be.” The foreigners who
sell the second-hand Dutch clocks sell also new
clocks of the same manufacture, and often on
tally, 1<i>s.</i> a week being the usual payment.</p>

<p><i>Cartouche-boxes</i> are sold at the miscellaneous
stalls, but only after there has been what I heard
called a “Tower sale” (sale of military stores).
When bought of the street-sellers, the use of these
boxes is far more peaceful than that for which
they were manufactured. Instead of the receptacles
of cartridges, the divisions are converted
into nail boxes, each with its different assortment,
or contain the smaller kinds of tools, such as awl-blades.
These boxes are sold in the streets at
&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 1<i>d.</i> each, and are bought by jobbing shoemakers
more than by any other class.</p>

<p>Of the other second-hand commodities of the
streets, I may observe that in <i>Trinkets</i> the trade
is altogether Jewish; in <i>Maps</i>, with frames, it is
now a nonentity, and so it is with <i>Fishing-rods</i>,
<i>Cricket-bats</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In <i>Umbrellas</i> and <i>Parasols</i> the second-hand
traffic is large, but those vended in the streets are
nearly all “done up” for street-sale by the class
known as “Mush,” or more properly “Mushroom
Fakers,” that is to say, the makers or <i>fakers</i>
(<i>facere</i>&mdash;the slang <i>fakement</i> being simply a corruption
of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facimentum</i>) of those articles
which are similar in shape to <i>mushrooms</i>. I shall
treat of this class and the goods they sell under
the head of Street-Artisans. The collectors of Old
Umbrellas and Parasols are the same persons as
collect the second-hand habiliments of male and
female attire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The men and women engaged in the street-commerce
carried on in second-hand articles are,
in all respects, a more mixed class than the generality
of street-sellers. Some hawk in the streets
goods which they also display in their shops, or
in the windowless apartments known as their
shops. Some are not in possession of shops, but
often buy their wares of those who are. Some
collect or purchase the articles they vend; others
collect them by barter. The itinerant crock-man,
the root-seller, the glazed table-cover seller, the
hawker of spars and worked stone, and even the
costermonger of the morning, is the dealer in
second-hand articles of the afternoon and evening.
The costermonger is, moreover, often the buyer
and seller of second-hand harness in Smithfield.
I may point out again, also, what a multifariousness
of wares passes in the course of a month through
the hands of a general street-seller; at one time
new goods, at another second-hand; sometimes
he is stationary at a pitch vending “lots,” or
“swag toys;” at others itinerant, selling braces,
belts, and hose.</p>

<p>I found no miscellaneous dealer who could tell
me of the proportionate receipts from the various
articles he dealt in even for the last month. He
“did well” in this, and badly in the other trade,
but beyond such vague statements there is no precise
information to be had. It should be recollected
that the street-sellers do not keep accounts,
or those documents would supply references. “It’s
all headwork with us,” a street-seller said, somewhat
boastingly, to me, as if the ignorance of
book-keeping was rather commendable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Second-hand Store Shops.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps it may add to the completeness of the
information here given concerning the trading in
old refuse articles, and especially those of a miscellaneous
character, the manner in which, and
the parties by whom the business is carried on,
if I conclude this branch of the subject by an
account of the shops of the second-hand dealers.
The distance between the class of these shopkeepers
and of the stall and barrow-keepers
I have described is not great. It may be said
to be merely from the street to within doors.
Marine-store dealers have often in their start in
life been street-sellers, not unfrequently costermongers,
and street-sellers they again become if
their ventures be unsuccessful. Some of them,
however, make a good deal of money in what
may be best understood as a “hugger-mugger
way.”</p>

<p>On this subject I cannot do better than quote
Mr. Dickens, one of the most minute and truthful
of <span class="lock">observers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The reader must often have perceived in some
by-street, in a poor neighbourhood, a small dirty
shop, exposing for sale the most extraordinary and
confused jumble of old, worn-out, wretched articles,
that can well be imagined. Our wonder at
their ever having been bought, is only to be
equalled by our astonishment at the idea of their
ever being sold again. On a board, at the side of
the door, are placed about twenty books&mdash;all odd
volumes; and as many wine-glasses&mdash;all different
patterns; several locks, an old earthenware pan,
full of rusty keys; two or three gaudy chimney
ornaments&mdash;cracked, of course; the remains of a
lustre, without any drops; a round frame like a
capital O, which has once held a mirror; a flute,
complete with the exception of the middle joint;
a pair of curling-irons; and a tinder-box. In
front of the shop-window, are ranged some half-dozen
high-backed chairs, with spinal complaints
and wasted legs; a corner cupboard; two or
three very dark mahogany tables with flaps like
mathematical problems; some pickle-bottles, some
surgeons’ ditto, with gilt labels and without
stoppers; an unframed portrait of some lady who
flourished about the beginning of the thirteenth
century, by an artist who never flourished at all;
an incalculable host of miscellanies of every description,
including armour and cabinets, rags and
bones, fenders and street-door knockers, fire-irons,
wearing-apparel and bedding, a hall-lamp, and a
room-door. Imagine, in addition to this incongruous
mass, a black doll in a white frock, with
two faces&mdash;one looking up the street, and the
other looking down, swinging over the door; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
board with the squeezed-up inscription ‘Dealer in
marine stores,’ in lanky white letters, whose
height is strangely out of proportion to their
width; and you have before you precisely the
kind of shop to which we wish to direct your
attention.</p>

<p>“Although the same heterogeneous mixture of
things will be found at all these places, it is
curious to observe how truly and accurately some
of the minor articles which are exposed for sale&mdash;articles
of wearing-apparel, for instance&mdash;mark the
character of the neighbourhood. Take Drury-lane
and Covent-garden for example.</p>

<p>“This is essentially a theatrical neighbourhood.
There is not a potboy in the vicinity who is not,
to a greater or less extent, a dramatic character.
The errand-boys and chandlers’-shop-keepers’ sons,
are all stage-struck: they ‘get up’ plays in back
kitchens hired for the purpose, and will stand
before a shop-window for hours, contemplating a
great staring portrait of Mr. somebody or other,
of the Royal Coburg Theatre, ‘as he appeared in
the character of Tongo the Denounced.’ The
consequence is, that there is not a marine-store
shop in the neighbourhood, which does not exhibit
for sale some faded articles of dramatic finery,
such as three or four pairs of soiled buff boots
with turn-over red tops, heretofore worn by a
‘fourth robber,’ or ‘fifth mob;’ a pair of rusty
broad-swords, a few gauntlets, and certain resplendent
ornaments, which, if they were yellow
instead of white, might be taken for insurance
plates of the Sun Fire-office. There are several
of these shops in the narrow streets and dirty
courts, of which there are so many near the
national theatres, and they all have tempting
goods of this description, with the addition, perhaps,
of a lady’s pink dress covered with spangles;
white wreaths, stage shoes, and a tiara like
a tin lamp reflector. They have been purchased of
some wretched supernumeraries, or sixth-rate
actors, and are now offered for the benefit of the
rising generation, who, on condition of making
certain weekly payments, amounting in the whole
to about ten times their value, may avail themselves
of such desirable bargains.</p>

<p>“Let us take a very different quarter, and
apply it to the same test. Look at a marine-store
dealer’s, in that reservoir of dirt, drunkenness,
and drabs: thieves, oysters, baked potatoes, and
pickled salmon&mdash;Ratcliff-highway. Here, the
wearing-apparel is all nautical. Rough blue
jackets, with mother-of-pearl buttons, oil-skin hats,
coarse checked shirts, and large canvass trousers
that look as if they were made for a pair of bodies
instead of a pair of legs, are the staple commodities.
Then, there are large bunches of cotton
pocket-handkerchiefs, in colour and pattern unlike
any one ever saw before, with the exception of
those on the backs of the three young ladies without
bonnets who passed just now. The furniture
is much the same as elsewhere, with the addition
of one or two models of ships, and some old
prints of naval engagements in still older frames.
In the window are a few compasses, a small tray
containing silver watches in clumsy thick cases;
and tobacco-boxes, the lid of each ornamented
with a ship, or an anchor, or some such trophy.
A sailor generally pawns or sells all he has before
he has been long ashore, and if he does not, some
favoured companion kindly saves him the trouble.
In either case, it is an even chance that he afterwards
unconsciously repurchases the same things
at a higher price than he gave for them at first.</p>

<p>“Again: pay a visit, with a similar object, to a
part of London, as unlike both of these as they
are to each other. Cross over to the Surry side,
and look at such shops of this description as are
to be found near the King’s Bench prison, and in
‘the Rules.’ How different, and how strikingly
illustrative of the decay of some of the unfortunate
residents in this part of the metropolis! Imprisonment
and neglect have done their work. There
is contamination in the profligate denizens of a
debtors’ prison; old friends have fallen off; the
recollection of former prosperity has passed away;
and with it all thoughts for the past, all care for
the future. First, watches and rings, then cloaks,
coats, and all the more expensive articles of dress,
have found their way to the pawnbroker’s. That
miserable resource has failed at last, and the sale
of some trifling article at one of these shops, has
been the only mode left of raising a shilling or
two, to meet the urgent demands of the moment.
Dressing-cases and writing-desks, too old to pawn
but too good to keep; guns, fishing-rods, musical
instruments, all in the same condition; have first
been sold, and the sacrifice has been but slightly
felt. But hunger must be allayed, and what has
already become a habit, is easily resorted to,
when an emergency arises. Light articles of
clothing, first of the ruined man, then of his wife,
at last of their children, even of the youngest,
have been parted with, piecemeal. There they
are, thrown carelessly together until a purchaser
presents himself, old, and patched and repaired,
it is true; but the make and materials tell of
better days: and the older they are, the greater
the misery and destitution of those whom they
once adorned.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-sellers of Second-hand
Apparel.</span></h3>

<p>The multifariousness of the articles of this trade
is limited only by what the uncertainty of the
climate, the caprices of fashion, or the established
styles of apparel in the kingdom, have caused to
be worn, flung aside, and reworn as a revival of
an obsolete style. It is to be remarked, however,
that of the old-fashioned styles none that are
costly have been revived. Laced coats, and embroidered
and lappeted waistcoats, have long disappeared
from second-hand traffic&mdash;the last stage
of fashions&mdash;and indeed from all places but court
or fancy balls and the theatre.</p>

<p>The great mart for second-hand apparel was,
in the last century, in Monmouth-street; now,
by one of those arbitrary, and almost always
inappropriate, changes in the nomenclature of
streets, termed Dudley-street, Seven Dials. “Monmouth-street
finery” was a common term to express
tawdriness and pretence. Now Monmouth-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>street,
for its new name is hardly legitimated,
has no finery. Its second-hand wares are almost
wholly confined to old boots and shoes, which are
vamped up with a good deal of trickery; so much so
that a shoemaker, himself in the poorer practice
of the “gentle craft,” told me that blacking and
brown paper were the materials of Monmouth-street
cobbling. Almost every master in Monmouth-street
now is, I am told, an Irishman; and
the great majority of the workmen are Irishmen
also. There were a few Jews and a few cockneys
in this well-known street a year or two
back, but now this branch of the second-hand
trade is really in the hands of what may be
called a clan. A little business is carried on in
second-hand apparel, as well as boots and shoes,
but it is insignificant.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of this second-hand trade
are now in Petticoat and Rosemary lanes, especially
in Petticoat-lane, and the traffic there
carried on may be called enormous. As in other
departments of commerce, both in our own capital,
in many of our older cities, and in the cities of
the Continent, the locality appropriated to this
traffic is one of narrow streets, dark alleys, and
most oppressive crowding. The traders seem to
judge of a Rag-fair garment, whether a cotton
frock or a ducal coachman’s great-coat, by the
touch, more reliably than by the sight; they inspect,
so to speak, with their fingers more than
their eyes. But the business in Petticoat and
Rosemary lanes is mostly of a retail character.
The wholesale mart&mdash;for the trade in old clothes
has both a wholesale and retail form&mdash;is in a place
of especial curiosity, and one of which, as being
little known, I shall first speak.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Old Clothes Exchange.</span></h3>

<p>The trade in second-hand apparel is one of the
most ancient of callings, and is known in almost
every country, but anything like the Old Clothes
Exchange of the Jewish quarter of London, in
the extent and order of its business, is unequalled
in the world. There is indeed no other such
place, and it is rather remarkable that a business
occupying so many persons, and requiring such
facilities for examination and arrangement, should
not until the year 1843 have had its regulated
proceedings. The Old Clothes Exchange is the
latest of the central marts, established in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Smithfield, or the Cattle Exchange, is the
oldest of all the markets; it is mentioned as a
place for the sale of horses in the time of Henry
II. Billingsgate, or the Fish Exchange, is of
ancient, but uncertain era. Covent Garden&mdash;the
largest Fruit, Vegetable, and Flower Exchange&mdash;first
became established as the centre of such commerce
in the reign of Charles II.; the establishment
of the Borough and Spitalfields markets, as
other marts for the sale of fruits, vegetables, and
flowers, being nearly as ancient. The Royal
Exchange dates from the days of Queen Elizabeth,
and the Bank of England and the Stock-Exchange
from those of William III., while the present premises
for the Corn and Coal Exchanges are modern.</p>

<p>Were it possible to obtain the statistics of the
last quarter of a century, it would, perhaps, be
found that in none of the important interests
I have mentioned has there been a greater increase
of business than in the trade in old clothes.
Whether this purports a high degree of national
prosperity or not, it is not my business at present
to inquire, and be it as it may, it is certain that,
until the last few years, the trade in old clothes
used to be carried on entirely in the open air, and
this in the localities which I have pointed out in
my account of the trade in old metal (p. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>, vol. ii.)
as comprising the Petticoat-lane district. The old
clothes trade was also pursued in Rosemary-lane,
but then&mdash;and so indeed it is now&mdash;this was but a
branch of the more centralized commerce of Petticoat-lane.
The head-quarters of the traffic at
that time were confined to a space not more than
ten square yards, adjoining Cutler-street. The
chief traffic elsewhere was originally in Cutler-street,
White-street, Carter-street, and in Harrow-alley&mdash;the
districts of the celebrated Rag-fair.</p>

<p>The confusion and clamour before the institution
of the present arrangements were extreme.
Great as was the extent of the business transacted,
people wondered how it could be accomplished, for
it always appeared to a stranger, that there could
be no order whatever in all the disorder. The
wrangling was incessant, nor were the trade-contests
always confined to wrangling alone. The
passions of the Irish often drove them to resort to
cuffs, kicks, and blows, which the Jews, although
with a better command over their tempers, were
not slack in returning. The East India Company,
some of whose warehouses adjoined the market,
frequently complained to the city authorities of
the nuisance. Complaints from other quarters
were also frequent, and sometimes as many as
200 constables were necessary to restore or enforce
order. The nuisance, however, like many a
public nuisance, was left to remedy itself, or
rather it was left to be remedied by individual
enterprise. Mr. L. Isaac, the present proprietor,
purchased the houses which then filled up the back
of Phil’s-buildings, and formed the present Old
Clothes Exchange. This was eight years ago;
now there are no more policemen in the locality
than in other equally populous parts.</p>

<p>Of Old Clothes Exchanges there are now
two, both adjacent, the one first opened by Mr.
Isaac being the most important. This is 100
feet by 70, and is the mart to which the collectors
of the cast-off apparel of the metropolis bring their
goods for sale. The goods are sold wholesale and
retail, for an old clothes merchant will buy either
a single hat, or an entire wardrobe, or a sackful
of shoes,&mdash;I need not say <i>pairs</i>, for odd shoes
are not rejected. In one department of “Isaac’s
Exchange,” however, the goods are not sold to
parties who buy for their own wearing, but to the
old clothes merchant, who buys to sell again. In
this portion of the mart are 90 stalls, averaging
about six square feet each.</p>

<p>In another department, which communicates
with the first, and is two-thirds of the size, are
assembled such traders as buy the old garments to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
dispose of them, either after a process of cleaning,
or when they have been repaired and renovated.
These buyers are generally shopkeepers, residing
in the old clothes districts of Marylebone-lane,
Holywell-street, Monmouth-street, Union-street
(Borough), Saffron-hill (Field-lane), Drury-lane,
Shoreditch, the Waterloo-road, and other places
of which I shall have to speak hereafter.</p>

<p>The difference between the first and second
class of buyers above mentioned, is really that of
the merchant and the retail shopkeeper. The one
buys literally anything presented to him which is
vendible, and in any quantity, for the supply of
the wholesale dealers from distant parts, or for
exportation, or for the general trade of London.
The other purchases what suits his individual
trade, and is likely to suit regular or promiscuous
customers.</p>

<p>In another part of the same market is carried
on the <i>retail</i> old clothes trade to any one&mdash;shopkeeper,
artisan, clerk, costermonger, or gentlemen.
This indeed, is partially the case in the other
parts. “Yesh, inteet,” said a Hebrew trader,
whom I conversed with on the subject, “I shall
be clad to shell you one coat, sir. Dish von is
shust your shize; it is verra sheep, and vosh
made by one tip-top shnip.” Indeed, the keenness
and anxiety to trade&mdash;whenever trade seems
possible&mdash;causes many of the frequenters of these
marts to infringe the arrangements as to the
manner of the traffic, though the proprietors
endeavour to cause the regulations to be strictly
adhered to.</p>

<p>The second Exchange, which is a few yards
apart from the other is known as Simmons and
Levy’s Clothes Exchange, and is unemployed, for
its more especial business purposes, except in
the mornings. The commerce is then wholesale,
for here are sold collections of unredeemed pledges
in wearing apparel, consigned there by the pawnbrokers,
or the buyers at the auctions of unredeemed
goods; as well as draughts from the
stocks of the wardrobe dealers; a quantity of
military or naval stores, and such like articles.
In the afternoon the stalls are occupied by retail
dealers. The ground is about as large as the first-mentioned
exchange, but is longer and narrower.</p>

<p>In neither of these places is there even an
attempt at architectural elegance, or even neatness.
The stalls and partitions are of unpainted
wood, the walls are bare, the only care that
seems to be manifested is that the places should
be dry. In the first instance the plainness was
no doubt a necessity from motives of prudence, as
the establishments were merely speculations, and
now everything but <i>business</i> seems to be disregarded.
The Old Clothes Exchanges have assuredly
one recommendation as they are now
seen&mdash;their appropriateness. They have a threadbare,
patched, and <i>second-hand</i> look. The dresses
worn by the dealers, and the dresses they deal
in, are all in accordance with the genius of the
place. But the eagerness, crowding, and energy,
are the grand features of the scene; and of all
the many curious sights in London there is none
so picturesque (from the various costumes of the
buyers and sellers), none so novel, and none so
animated as that of the Old Clothes Exchange.</p>

<p>Business is carried on in the wholesale department
of the Old Clothes Exchanges every day
during the week; and in the retail on each day
except the Hebrew Sabbath (Saturday). The
Jews in the old clothes trade observe strictly the
command that on their Sabbath day they shall do
no manner of work, for on a visit I paid to the
Exchange last Saturday, not a single Jew could I
see engaged in any business. But though the
Hebrew Sabbath is observed by the Jews and
disregarded by the Christians, the Christian
Sabbath, on the other hand, is disregarded by Jew
and Christian alike, some few of the Irish excepted,
who may occasionally go to early mass,
and attend at the Exchange afterwards. Sunday,
therefore, in “Rag-fair,” is like the other days of
the week (Saturday excepted); business closes on
the Sunday, however, at 2 instead of 6.</p>

<p>On the Saturday the keen Jew-traders in the
neighbourhood of the Exchanges may be seen
standing at their doors&mdash;after the synagogue hours&mdash;or
looking out of their windows, dressed in their
best. The dress of the men is for the most part
not distinguishable from that of the English on
the Sunday, except that there may be a greater
glitter of rings and watch-guards. The dress of
the women is of every kind; becoming, handsome,
rich, tawdry, but seldom neat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Wholesale Business at the Old
Clothes Exchange.</span></h3>

<p>A considerable quantity of the old clothes disposed
of at the Exchange are bought by merchants
from Ireland. They are then packed in
bales by porters, regularly employed for the
purpose, and who literally <i>build</i> them up square
and compact. These bales are each worth from
50<i>l.</i> to 300<i>l.</i>, though seldom 300<i>l.</i>, and it is
curious to reflect from how many classes
the pile of old garments has been collected&mdash;how
many privations have been endured
before some of these habiliments found their
way into the possession of the old clothesman&mdash;what
besotted debauchery put others in
his possession&mdash;with what cool calculation others
were disposed of&mdash;how many were procured for
money, and how many by the tempting offers of
flowers, glass, crockery, spars, table-covers, lace,
or millinery&mdash;what was the clothing which could
first be spared when rent was to be defrayed or
bread to be bought, and what was treasured until the
last&mdash;in what scenes of gaiety or gravity, in the
opera-house or the senate, had the perhaps departed
wearers of some of that heap of old clothes
figured&mdash;through how many possessors, and again
through what new scenes of middle-class or
artizan comfort had these dresses passed, or through
what accidents of “genteel” privation and destitution&mdash;and
lastly through what necessities of
squalid wretchedness and low debauchery.</p>

<p>Every kind of old attire, from the highest to
the <i>very lowest</i>, I was emphatically told, was
sent to Ireland.</p>

<p>Some of the bales are composed of garments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
originally made for the labouring classes. These
are made up of every description of colour and
material&mdash;cloth, corduroy, woollen cords, fustian,
moleskin, flannel, velveteen, plaids, and the several
varieties of those substances. In them are to be
seen coats, great-coats, jackets, trousers, and
breeches, but no other habiliments, such as boots,
shirts, or stockings. I was told by a gentleman,
who between 40 and 50 years ago was familiar
with the liberty and poorer parts of Dublin, that
the most coveted and the most saleable of all
second-hand apparel was that of leather breeches,
worn commonly in some of the country parts
of England half a century back, and sent
in considerable quantities at that time from
London to Ireland. These nether habiliments
were coveted because, as the Dublin sellers would
say, they “would wear for ever, and look illigant
after that.” Buck-skin breeches are now never
worn except by grooms in their liveries, and
gentlemen when hunting, so that the trade in
them in the Old Clothes Exchange, and their exportation
to Ireland, are at an end. The next most
saleable thing&mdash;I may mention, incidentally&mdash;vended
cheap and second-hand in Dublin, to the
poor Irishmen of the period I speak of, was a
wig! And happy was the man who could wear
two, one over the other.</p>

<p>Some of the Irish buyers who are regular frequenters
of the London Old Clothes Exchange,
take a small apartment, often a garret or a cellar,
in Petticoat-lane or its vicinity, and to this room
they convey their purchases until a sufficient stock
has been collected. Among these old clothes the
Irish possessors cook, or at any rate eat, their
meals, and upon them they sleep. I did not hear
that such dealers were more than ordinarily unhealthy; though
it may, perhaps, be assumed that
such habits are fatal to health. What may be the
average duration of life among old clothes sellers
who live in the midst of their wares, I do not
know, and believe that no facts have been collected
on the subject; but I certainly saw among
them some very old men.</p>

<p>Other wholesale buyers from Ireland occupy
decent lodgings in the neighbourhood&mdash;decent
considering the locality. In Phil’s-buildings, a
kind of wide alley which forms one of the approaches
to the Exchange, are eight respectable
apartments, almost always let to the Irish old
clothes merchants.</p>

<p>Tradesmen of the same class come also from
the large towns of England and Scotland to buy
for their customers some of the left-off clothes of
London.</p>

<p>Nor is this the extent of the wholesale trade.
Bales of old clothes are exported to Belgium and
Holland, but principally to Holland. Of the
quantity of goods thus exported to the Continent
not above one-half, perhaps, can be called old
<i>clothes</i>, while among these the old livery suits are in
the best demand. The other goods of this foreign
trade are old serges, duffles, carpeting, drugget,
and heavy woollen goods generally, of all the
descriptions which I have before enumerated as
parcel of the second-hand trade of the streets.
Old merino curtains, and any second-hand decorations
of fringes, woollen lace, &amp;c., are in demand
for Holland.</p>

<p>Twelve bales, averaging somewhere about 100<i>l.</i>
each in value, but not fully 100<i>l.</i>, are sent direct
every week of the year from the Old Clothes
Exchange to distant places, and this is not the
whole of the traffic, apart from what is done retail.
I am informed on the best authority, that the
average trade may be stated at 1500<i>l.</i> a week
all the year round. When I come to the
conclusion of the subject, however, I shall be
able to present statistics of the amount turned
over in the respective branches of the old
clothes trade, as well as of the number of the
traffickers, only one-fourth of whom are now
Jews.</p>

<p>The conversation which goes on in the Old
Clothes Exchange during business hours, apart
from the “larking” of the young sweet-stuff and
orange or cake-sellers, is all concerning business,
but there is, even while business is being transacted,
a frequent interchange of jokes, and even of
practical jokes. The business talk&mdash;I was told
by an old clothes collector, and I heard similar
remarks&mdash;is often to the following <span class="lock">effect:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“How much is this here?” says the man who
comes to buy. “One pound five,” replies the
Jew seller. “I won’t give you above half the
money.” “Half de money,” cries the salesman,
“I can’t take dat. Vat above the 16<i>s.</i> dat you
offer now vill you give for it? Vill you give me
eighteen? Vell, come, give ush your money, I’ve
got ma rent to pay.” But the man says, “I only
bid you 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and I shan’t give no more.”
And then, if the seller finds he can get him to
“spring” or advance no further, he says, “I shupposh
I musht take your money even if I loosh by
it. You’ll be a better cushtomer anoder time.”
[This is still a common “deal,” I am assured by
one who began the business at 13 years old, and
is now upwards of 60 years of age. The Petticoat-laner
will always ask at least twice as
much as he means to take.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a more detailed account of the mode of
business as conducted at the Old Clothes Exchange
I refer the reader to p. 368, vol. i. Subsequent
visits have shown me nothing to alter in
that description, although written (in one of my
letters in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>), nearly two
years ago. I have merely to add that I have
there mentioned the receipt of a halfpenny toll;
but this, I find, is not levied on Saturdays and
Sundays.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I ought not to omit stating that pilfering one
from another by the poor persons who have collected
the second-hand garments, and have carried
them to the Old Clothes Exchange to dispose of,
is of very rare occurrence. This is the more commendable,
for many of the wares could not be
identified by their owner, as he had procured
them only that morning. If, as happens often
enough, a man carried a dozen pairs of old
shoes to the Exchange, and one pair were stolen, he
might have some difficulty in swearing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
identity of the pair purloined. It is true that
the Jews, and crock-men, and others, who collect,
by sale or barter, masses of old clothes, note all
their defects very minutely, and might have no
moral doubt as to identity, nevertheless the
magistrate would probably conclude that the legal
evidence&mdash;were it only circumstantial&mdash;was insufficient.
The young thieves, however, who flock
from the low lodging-houses in the neighbourhood,
are an especial trouble in Petticoat-lane,
where the people robbed are generally too busy,
and the article stolen of too little value, to induce
a prosecution&mdash;a knowledge which the juvenile
pilferer is not slow in acquiring. Sometimes when
these boys are caught pilfering, they are severely
beaten, especially by the women, who are aided
by the men, if the thief offers any formidable resistance,
or struggles to return the blows.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Uses of Second-hand Garments.</span></h3>

<p>I have now to describe the uses to which the
several kinds of garments which constitute the
commerce of the Old Clothes Exchange are devoted,
whether it be merely in the re-sale of the
apparel, to be worn in its original form or in a
repaired or renovated form; or whether it be
“worked up” into other habiliments, or be useful
for the making of other descriptions of woollen
fabrics; or else whether it be fit merely for its last
stages&mdash;the rag-bag for the paper-maker, or the
manure heap for the hop-grower.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each “left-off” garment has its peculiar after
<i>uses</i>, according to its material and condition. The
practised eye of the old clothes man at once embraces
every capability of the apparel, and the
amount which these capabilities will realize; whether
they be woollen, linen, cotton, leathern, or
silken goods; or whether they be articles which
cannot be classed under any of those designations,
such as macintoshes and furs.</p>

<p>A <i>surtout</i> coat is the most serviceable of any
second-hand clothing, originally good. It can
be re-cuffed, re-collared, or the skirts re-lined with
new or old silk, or with a substitute for silk.
It can be “restored” if the seams be white and
the general appearance what is best understood
by the expressive word “seedy.” This restoration
is a sort of re-dyeing, or rather re-colouring,
by the application of gall and logwood with a
small portion of copperas. If the under sleeve be
worn, as it often is by those whose avocations are
sedentary, it is renewed, and frequently with a
second-hand piece of cloth “to match,” so that
there is no perceptible difference between the
renewal and the other parts. Many an honest
artisan in this way becomes possessed of his
Sunday frock-coat, as does many a smarter clerk
or shopman, impressed with a regard to his personal
appearance.</p>

<p>In the last century, I may here observe, and
perhaps in the early part of the present, when
woollen cloth was much dearer, much more substantial,
and therefore much more durable, it was
common for economists to have a good coat “turned.”
It was taken to pieces by the tailor and re-made,
the inner part becoming the outer. This mode
prevailed alike in France and England; for Molière
makes his miser, <i>Harpagon</i>, magnanimously
resolve to incur the cost of his many-years’-old
coat being “turned,” for the celebration of his
expected marriage with a young and wealthy
bride. This way of dealing with a second-hand
garment is not so general now as it was formerly
in London, nor is it in the country.</p>

<p>If the surtout be incapable of restoration to
the appearance of a “respectable” garment, the
skirts are sold for the making of cloth caps;
or for the material of boys’ or “youths’” waistcoats;
or for “poor country curates’ gaiters; but
not so much now as they once were. The poor
journeymen parsons,” I was told, “now goes
for the new slops; they’re often green, and is
had by ’vertisements, and bills, and them books
about fashions which is all over both country
and town. Do you know, sir, why them
there books is always made so small? The leaves
is about four inches square. That’s to prevent
their being any use as waste paper. I’ll back a
coat such as is sometimes sold by a gentleman’s
servant to wear out two new slops.”</p>

<p><i>Cloaks</i> are things of as ready sale as any kind
of old garments. If good, or even reparable, they
are in demand both for the home and foreign
trades, as cloaks; if too far gone, which is but
rarely the case, they are especially available for
the same purposes as the surtout. The same may
be said of the great-coat.</p>

<p><i>Dress-coats</i> are far less useful, as if cleaned up
and repaired they are not in demand among the
working classes, and the clerks and shopmen on
small salaries are often tempted by the price, I
was told, to buy some wretched new slop thing
rather than a superior coat second-hand. The
dress-coats, however, are used for caps. Sometimes
a coat, for which the collector may have given
9<i>d.</i>, is cut up for the repairs of better garments.</p>

<p><i>Trousers</i> are re-seated and repaired where the
material is strong enough; and they are, I am
informed, now about the only habiliment which is
ever “turned,” and that but exceptionally. The
repairs to trousers are more readily effected than
those to coats, and trousers are freely bought by
the collectors, and as freely re-bought by the
public.</p>

<p><i>Waistcoats</i>&mdash;I still speak of woollen fabrics&mdash;are
sometimes used in cap-making, and were used
in gaiter-making. But generally, at the present
time, the worn edges are cut away, the buttons
renewed or replaced by a new set, sometimes of
glittering glass, the button-holes repaired or their
jaggedness gummed down, and so the waistcoat
is reproduced as a waistcoat, a size smaller.
Sometimes a “vest,” as waistcoats are occasionally
called, is used by the cheap boot-makers for the
“legs” of a woman’s cloth boots, either laced or
buttoned, but not a quarter as much as they would
be, I was told, if the buttons and button-holes of
the waistcoat would “do again” in the boot.</p>

<p>Nor is the woollen garment, if too thin, too
worn, or too rotten to be devoted to any of the
uses I have specified, flung away as worthless. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the traders in second-hand apparel, or in the remains
of second-hand apparel, a dust-hole is an
unknown receptacle. The woollen rag, for so it
is then considered, when unravelled can be made
available for the manufacture of cheap yarns,
being mixed with new wool. It is more probable,
however, that the piece of woollen fabric which
has been rejected by those who make or mend,
and who must make or mend so cheaply that the
veriest vagrant may be their customer, is formed
not only into a new material, but into a material
which sometimes is made into a new garment.
These garments are inferior to those woven of new
wool, both in look and wear; but in some articles
the re-manufacture is beautiful. The fabric thus
snatched, as it were, from the ruins of cloth, is
known as shoddy, the chief seat of manufacture
being in Dewsbury, a small town in Yorkshire.
The old material, when duly prepared, is torn
into wool again by means of fine machinery, but
the recovered wool is shorter in its fibre and
more brittle in its nature; it is, indeed, more a
woollen pulp than a wool.</p>

<p>Touching this peculiar branch of manufacture,
I will here cite from the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> a
brief description of a Shoddy Mill, so that the
reader may have as comprehensive a knowledge
as possible of the several uses to which his left-off
clothes may be put.</p>

<p>“The small town of Dewsbury holds, in the
woollen district, very much the same position
which Oldham does in the cotton country&mdash;the
spinning and preparing of waste and refuse materials.
To this stuff the name of “shoddy” is
given, but the real and orthodox “shoddy” is a
production of the woollen districts, and consists
of the second-hand wool manufactured by the
tearing up, or rather the grinding, of woollen rags
by means of coarse willows, called devils; the
operation of which sends forth choking clouds of
dry pungent dirt and floating fibres&mdash;the real and
original “devil’s dust.” Having been, by the
agency of the machinery in question, reduced to
something like the original raw material, fresh
wool is added to the pulp in different proportions,
according to the quality of the stuff to be manufactured,
and the mingled material is at length
reworked in the usual way into a little serviceable
cloth.</p>

<p>“There are some shoddy mills in the neighbourhood
of Huddersfield, but the mean little town
of Dewsbury may be taken as the metropolis of
the manufacture. Some mills are devoted solely
to the sorting, preparing, and grinding of rags,
which are worked up in the neighbouring factories.
Here great bales, choke full of filthy tatters, lie
scattered about the yard, while the continual
arrival of loaded waggons keeps adding to the
heap. A glance at the exterior of these mills
shows their character. The walls and part of
the roof are covered with the thick clinging dust
and fibre, which ascends in choky volumes from the
open doors and glassless windows of the ground
floor, and which also pours forth from a chimney,
constructed for the purpose, exactly like smoke.
The mill is covered as with a mildewy fungus, and
upon the gray slates of the roof the frowzy
deposit is often not less than two inches in depth.</p>

<p>“In the upper story of these mills the rags are
stored. A great ware-room is piled in many
places from the floor to the ceiling with bales of
woollen rags, torn strips and tatters of every
colour peeping out from the bursting depositories.
There is hardly a country in Europe which does
not contribute its quota of material to the shoddy
manufacturer. Rags are brought from France,
Germany, and in great quantities from Belgium.
Denmark, I understand, is favourably looked upon
by the tatter merchants, being fertile in morsels of
clothing, of fair quality. Of domestic rags, the
Scotch bear off the palm; and possibly no one
will be surprised to hear, that of all rags Irish
rags are the most worn, the filthiest, and generally
the most unprofitable. The gradations of
value in the world of rags are indeed remarkable.
I was shown rags worth 50<i>l.</i> per ton, and rags
worth only 30<i>s.</i> The best class is formed of the
remains of fine cloth, the produce of which, eked
out with a few bundles of fresh wool, is destined
to go forth to the world again as broad cloth, or
at all events as pilot cloth. Fragments of damask
and skirts of merino dresses form the staple of
middle-class rags; and even the very worst bales&mdash;they
appear unmitigated mashes of frowzy
filth&mdash;afford here and there some fragments of
calico, which are wrought up into brown paper.
The refuse of all, mixed with the stuff which even
the shoddy-making devil rejects, is packed off to
the agricultural districts for use as manure, to fertilize
the hop-gardens of Kent.</p>

<p>“Under the rag ware-room is the sorting and
picking room. Here the bales are opened, and
their contents piled in close, poverty-smelling
masses, upon the floor. The operatives are entirely
women. They sit upon low stools, or half
sunk and half enthroned amid heaps of the filthy
goods, busily employed in arranging them according
to the colour and the quality of the morsels,
and from the more pretending quality of rags
carefully ripping out every particle of cotton
which they can detect. Piles of rags of different
sorts, dozens of feet high, are the obvious fruits
of their labour. All these women are over eighteen
years of age, and the wages which they are
paid for ten hours’ work are 6<i>s.</i> per week. They
look squalid and dirty enough; but all of them
chatter and several sing over their noisome labour.
The atmosphere of the room is close and
oppressive; and although no particularly offensive
smell is perceptible, there is a choky, mildewy
sort of odour&mdash;a hot, moist exhalation&mdash;arising
from the sodden smouldering piles, as the workwomen
toss armfuls of rags from one heap to
another. This species of work is the lowest and
foulest which any phase of the factory system can
show.</p>

<p>“The devils are upon the ground floor. The
choking dust bursts out from door and window,
and it is not until a minute or so that the visitor
can see the workmen moving amid the clouds,
catching up armfuls of the sorted rags and tossing
them into the machine to be torn into fibry frag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>ments
by the whirling revolutions of its teeth.
The place in which this is done is a large bare
room&mdash;the uncovered beams above, the rough
stone walls, and the woodwork of the unglazed
windows being as it were furred over with clinging
woolly matter. On the floor, the dust and
coarse filaments lie as if ‘it had been snowing
snuff.’ The workmen are coated with the flying
powder. They wear bandages over their mouths,
so as to prevent as much as possible the inhalation
of the dust, and seem loath to remove the protection
for a moment. The rag grinders, with their
squalid, dust-strewn garments, powdered to a dull
grayish hue, and with their bandages tied over
the greater part of their faces, move about like
reanimated mummies in their swathings, looking
most ghastly. The wages of these poor creatures
do not exceed 7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> a week. The men are
much better paid, none of them making less than
18<i>s.</i> a week, and many earning as much as 22<i>s.</i>
Not one of them, however, will admit that he
found the trade injurious. The dust tickles them
a little, they say, that is all. They feel it most
of a Monday morning, after being all Sunday in
the fresh air. When they first take to the work
it hurts their throats a little, but they drink mint
tea, and that soon cures them. They are all
more or less subject to ‘shoddy fever,’ they confess,
especially after tenting the grinding of the
very dusty sorts of stuff&mdash;worsted stockings, for
example. The shoddy fever is a sort of stuffing
of the head and nose, with sore throat, and it
sometimes forces them to give over work for two
or three days, or at most a week; but the disorder,
the workmen say, is not fatal, and leaves
no particularly bad effects.</p>

<p>“In spite of all this, however, it is manifestly
impossible for human lungs to breathe under such
circumstances without suffering. The visitor exposed
to the atmosphere for ten minutes experiences
an unpleasant choky sensation in the
throat, which lasts all the remainder of the day.
The rag grinders, moreover, according to the best
accounts, are very subject to asthmatic complaints,
particularly when the air is dull and warm. The
shoddy fever is said to be like a bad cold, with
constant acrid running from the nose, and a great
deal of expectoration. It is when there is a particularly
dirty lot of rags to be ground that the
people are usually attacked in this way, but the
fever seldom keeps them more than two or three
days from their work.</p>

<p>“In other mills the rags are not only ground, but
the shoddy is worked up into coarse bad cloth, a
great proportion of which is sent to America for
slave clothing (and much now sold to the slop-shops).</p>

<p>“After the rags have been devilled into shoddy,
the remaining processes are much the same, although
conducted in a coarser way, as those
performed in the manufacture of woollen cloth.
The weaving is, for the most part, carried on at
the homes of the workpeople. The domestic
arrangements consist, in every case, of two tolerably
large rooms, one above the other, with a cellar
beneath&mdash;a plan of construction called in Yorkshire
a “house and a chamber.” The chamber
has generally a bed amid the looms. The weavers
complain of irregular work and diminished wages.
Their average pay, one week with another, with
their wives to wind for them&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, to place the
thread upon the bobbin which goes into the shuttle&mdash;is
hardly so much as 10<i>s.</i> a week. They work
long hours, often fourteen per day. Sometimes
the weaver is a small capitalist with perhaps half
a dozen looms, and a hand-jenny for spinning
thread, the workpeople being within his own
family as regular apprentices and journeymen.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hemingway, a gentleman who has a large
practice in the shoddy district, has given the following
information touching the “shoddy fever”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The disease popularly known as ‘shoddy
fever,’ and which is of frequent occurrence, is a
species of bronchitis, caused by the irritating effect
of the floating particles of dust upon the mucous
membrane of the trachea and its ramifications. In
general, the attack is easily cured&mdash;particularly if
the patient has not been for any length of time
exposed to the exciting cause&mdash;by effervescing
saline draughts to allay the symptomatic febrile
action, followed by expectorants to relieve the
mucous membrane of the irritating dust; but a
long continuance of employment in the contaminated
atmosphere, bringing on as it does repeated
attacks of the disease, is too apt, in the end, to
undermine the constitution, and produce a train of
pectoral diseases, often closing with pulmonary
consumption. Ophthalmic attacks are by no
means uncommon among the shoddy-grinders, some
of whom, however, wear wire-gauze spectacles to
protect the eyes. As regards the effect of the
occupation upon health, it may shorten life by
about five years on a rough average, taking, of
course, as the point of comparison, the average
longevity of the district in which the manufacture
is carried on.”</p>

<p>“Shoddy fever” is, in fact, a modification of
the very fatal disease induced by what is called
“dry grinding” at Sheffield; but of course the
particles of woollen filament are less fatal in their
influence than the floating steel dust produced by
the operation in question.</p>

<p>At one time shoddy cloth was not good and
firm enough to be used for other purposes than
such as padding by tailors, and in the inner linings
of carriages, by coach-builders. It was not used
for purposes which would expose it to stress, but
only to a moderate wear or friction. Now shoddy,
which modern improvements have made susceptible
of receiving a fine dye (it always looked a
dead colour at one period), is made into cloth for
soldiers’ and sailors’ uniforms and for pilot-coats;
into blanketing, drugget, stair and other carpeting,
and into those beautiful table-covers, with their
rich woollen look, on which elegantly drawn and
elaborately coloured designs are printed through
the application of aquafortis. Thus the rags
which the beggar could no longer hang about him
to cover his nakedness, may be a component of the
soldier’s or sailor’s uniform, the carpet of a palace,
or the library table-cover of a prime-minister.</p>

<p>There is yet another use for old woollen clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
What is not good for shoddy is good for manure,
and more especially for the manure prepared by
the agriculturists in Kent, Sussex, and Herefordshire,
for the culture of a difficult plant&mdash;hops.
It is good also for corn land (judiciously used),
so that we again have the remains of the old
garment in our beer or our bread.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have hitherto spoken of <i>woollen</i> fabrics. The
garments of other materials are seldom diverted
from their original use, for as long as they will
hold together they can be sold for exportation to
Ireland, though of course for very trifling amounts.</p>

<p>The black <i>Velvet</i> and <i>Satin Waistcoats</i>&mdash;the
latter now so commonly worn&mdash;are almost always
resold as waistcoats, and oft enough, when rebound
and rebuttoned, make a very respectable
looking garment. Nothing sells better to the
working-classes than a <i>good</i> second-hand vest of
the two materials of satin or velvet. If the satin,
however, be so worn and frayed that mending is
impossible, the back, if not in the same plight, is
removed for rebacking of any waistcoat, and the
satin thrown away, one of the few things which
in its last stage is utterly valueless. It is the
same with silk waistcoats, and for the most part
with velvet, but a velvet waistcoat may be thrown
in the refuse heap with the woollen rags for
manure. The coloured waistcoats of silk or velvet
are dealt with in the same way. At one time,
when under-waistcoats were worn, the edges being
just discernible, quantities were made out of the
full waistcoats where a sufficiency of the stuff was
unworn. This fashion is now becoming less and
less followed, and is principally in vogue in the
matter of white under-waistcoats. For the jean
and other vests&mdash;even if a mixture of materials&mdash;there
is the same use as what I have described of
the black satin, and failing that, they are generally
transferable to the rag-bag.</p>

<p><i>Hats</i> have become in greater demand than ever
among the street-buyers since the introduction
into the London trade, and to so great an extent,
of the silk, velvet, French, or Parisian hats. The
construction of these hats is the same, and the
easy way in which the hat-bodies are made, has
caused a number of poor persons, with no previous
knowledge of hat-making, to enter into the trade.
“There’s hundreds starving at it,” said a hat-manufacturer
to me, “in Bermondsey, Lock’s-fields,
and the Borough; ay, hundreds.” This
facility in the making of the bodies of the new
silk hats is quite as available in the restoration of
the bodies of the old hats, as I shall show from
the information of a highly-intelligent artisan,
who told me that of all people he disliked rich
slop-sellers; but there was another class which he
disliked more, and that was rich slop-buyers.</p>

<p>The bodies of the stuff or beaver hats of the
best quality are made of a firm felt, wrought up of
fine wool, rabbits’ hair, &amp;c., and at once elastic,
firm, and light. Over this is placed the nap, prepared
from the hair of the beaver. The bodies of
the silk hats are made of calico, which is blocked
(as indeed is the felt) and stiffened and pasted up
until “only a hat-maker can tell,” as it was expressed
to me, “good sound bodies from bad; and
the slop-masters go for the cheap and bad.” The
covering is not a nap of any hair, but is of silk or
velvet (the words are used indifferently in the
trade) manufactured for the purpose. Thus if an
old hat be broken, or rather crushed out of all
shape, the body can be glazed and sized up again
so as to suit the slop hatter, if sold to him as a
body, and that whether it be of felt or calico. If,
however, the silk cover of the hat be not worn
utterly away, the body, without stripping off the
cover, can be re-blocked and re-set, and the silk-velvet
trimmed up and “set,” or re-dyed, and a
decent hat is sometimes produced by these means.
More frequently, however, a steeping shower of
rain destroys the whole fabric.</p>

<p><i>Second-hand Caps</i> are rarely brought into this
trade.</p>

<p>Such things as <i>drawers</i>, <i>flannel waistcoats</i>, and
what is sometimes called “inner wear,” sell very
well when washed up, patched&mdash;for patches do
not matter in a garment hidden from the eye
when worn&mdash;or mended in any manner. Flannel
waistcoats and drawers are often in demand by
the street-sellers and the street-labourers, as they
are considered “good against the rheumatics.”
These habiliments are often sold unrepaired, having
been merely washed, as the poor men’s wives may
be competent to execute an easy bit of tailoring;
or perhaps the men themselves, if they have been
reared as mechanics; and they believe (perhaps
erroneously) that so they obtain a better bargain.
<i>Shirts</i> are repaired and sold as shirts, or for old
linen; the trade is not large.</p>

<p><i>Men’s Stockings</i> are darned up, but only when
there is little to be done in darning, as they are
retailed at 2<i>d.</i> the pair. The sale is not very
great, for the supply is not. “Lots might be sold,”
I was informed, “if they was to be had, for them
flash coves never cares what they wears under
their Wellingtons.”</p>

<p><i>The Women’s Apparel</i> is sold to be re-worn in
its original form quite as frequently, or more frequently,
than it is mended up by the sellers; the
purchasers often preferring to make the alterations
themselves. A gown of stuff, cotton, or any
material, if full-sized, is frequently bought and
altered to fit a smaller person or a child, and so
the worn parts may be cut away. It is very
rarely also that the apparel of the middle-classes
is made into any other article, with the sole exception,
perhaps, of <i>silk gowns</i>. If a silk gown
be not too much frayed, it is easily cleaned and
polished up, so as to present a new gloss, and is
sold readily enough; but if it be too far gone for
this process, the old clothes renovator is often
puzzled as to what uses to put it. A portion of a
black silk dress may be serviceable to re-line the
cuffs of the better kind of coats. There is seldom
enough, I was told, to re-line the two skirts of a
surtout, and it is difficult to match old silk; a
man used to buying a good second-hand surtout, I
was assured, would soon detect a difference in the
shade of the silk, if the skirts were re-lined from
the remains of different gowns, and say, “I’ll not
give any such money for that piebald thing.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Skirts may be sometimes re-lined this way on the
getting up of frock coats, but very rarely. There
is the same difficulty in using a coloured silk gown
for the re-covering of a parasol. The quantity
may not be enough for the gores, and cannot be
matched to satisfy the eye, for the buyer of a silk
parasol even in Rosemary-lane may be expected to
be critical. When there is enough of good silk
for the purposes I have mentioned, then, it must
be borne in mind, the gown may be more valuable,
because saleable to be re-worn as a gown. It is
the same with satin dresses, but only a few of
them, in comparison with the silk, are to be seen
at the Old Clothes’ Exchange.</p>

<p>Among the purposes to which portions of worn
silk gowns are put are the making of spencers
for little girls (usually by the purchasers, or by
the dress-maker, who goes out to work for 1<i>s.</i> a
day), of children’s bonnets, for the lining of
women’s bonnets, the re-lining of muffs and fur-tippets,
the patching of quilts (once a rather
fashionable thing), the inner lining or curtains to a
book-case, and other household appliances of a
like kind. This kind of silk, too, no matter in
how minute pieces, is bought by the fancy cabinet-makers
(the small masters) for the lining of their
dressing-cases and work-boxes supplied to the
warehouses, but these poor artisans have neither
means nor leisure to buy such articles of those
connected with the traffic of the Old Clothes’ Exchange,
but must purchase it, of course at an enhanced
price, of a broker who has bought it at
the Exchange, or in some establishment connected
with it. The second-hand silk is bought also for
the dressing of dolls for the toy-shops, and for the
lining of some toys. The hat-manufacturers of
the cheaper sort, at one time, used second-hand
silk for the padded lining of hats, but such is
rarely the practice now. It was once used in the
same manner by the bookbinders for lining the
inner part of the back of a book. If there be
any part of silk in a dress not suitable for any of
these purposes it is wasted, or what is accounted
wasted, although it may have been in wear for
years. It is somewhat remarkable, that while
woollen and even cotton goods can be “shoddied”&mdash;and
if they are too rotten for that, they are made
available for manure, or in the manufacture of paper&mdash;no
use is made of the refuse of silk. Though one of
the most beautiful and costly of textile fabrics, its
“remains” are thrown aside, when a beggar’s rags
are preserved and made profitable. There can be
little doubt that silk, like cotton, could be shoddied,
but whether such a speculation would be remunerative
or not is no part of my present inquiry.</p>

<p>There is not, as I shall subsequently show, so
great an exportation of female attire as might be
expected in comparison with male apparel; the
poorer classes of the metropolis being too anxious
to get any decent gown when within their slender
means.</p>

<p><i>Stays</i>, unless of superior make and in good
condition, are little bought by the classes who are
the chief customers of the old-clothes’ men in
London. I did not hear any reason for this from
any of the old-clothes’ people. One man thought,
if there was a family of daughters, the stays
which had became too small for the elder girl were
altered for the younger, and that poor women liked
to mend their old stays as long as they would stick
together. Perhaps, there may be some repugnance&mdash;especially
among the class of servant-maids
who have not had “to rough it”&mdash;to wear street-collected
stays; a repugnance not, perhaps, felt
in the wearing of a gown which probably can be
washed, and is not worn so near the person. The
stays that are collected are for the most part exported,
a great portion being sent to Ireland. If
they are “worn to rags,” the bones are taken out;
but in the slop-made stays, it is not whalebone,
but wood that is used to give, or preserve the due
shape of the corset, and then the stays are
valueless.</p>

<p><i>Old Stockings</i> are of great sale both for home
wear and foreign trade. In the trade of women’s
stockings there has been in the last 20 or 25
years a considerable change. Before that period
black stockings were worn by servant girls, and
the families of working people and small tradesmen;
they “saved washing.” Now, even in Petticoat-lane,
women’s stockings are white, or “mottled,”
or some light-coloured, very rarely black.
I have heard this change attributed to what is
rather vaguely called “pride.” May it not be
owing to a more cultivated sense of cleanliness?
The women’s stockings are sold darned and
undarned, and at (retail) prices from 1<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i>;
1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> being the most frequent prices.</p>

<p>The <i>petticoats</i> and other under clothing are not
much bought second-hand by the poor women of
London, and are exported.</p>

<p><i>Women’s caps</i> used to be sold second-hand, I
was told, both in the streets and the shops, but
long ago, and before muslin and needlework were
so cheap.</p>

<p>I heard of one article which formerly supplied
considerable “stuff” (the word used) for second-hand
purposes, and was a part, but never a considerable
part, of the trade at Rag-fair. These
were the “<i>pillions</i>,” or large, firm, solid cushions
which were attached to a saddle, so that a horse
“carried double.” Fifty years ago the farmer and
his wife, of the more prosperous order, went
regularly to church and market on one horse, a
pillion sustaining the good dame. To the best
sort of these pillions was appended what was
called the “pillion cloth,” often of a fine, but thin
quality, which being really a sort of housing to
the horse, cut straight and with few if any seams,
was an excellent material for what I am informed
was formerly called “making and mending.” The
colour was almost exclusively drab or blue. The
pillion on which the squire’s lady rode&mdash;and
Sheridan makes his <i>Lady Teazle</i> deny “the
pillion and the coach-horse,” the butler being her
cavalier&mdash;was a perfect piece of upholstery, set off
with lace and fringes, which again were excellent
for second-hand sale. Such a means of conveyance
may still linger in some secluded country
parts, but it is generally speaking obsolete.</p>

<p><i>Boots</i> and <i>Shoes</i> are not to be had, I am told,
in sufficient quantity for the demand from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slop-shops, the “translators,” and the second-hand
dealers. Great quantities of second-hand boots and
shoes are sent to Ireland to be “translated” there.
Of all the wares in this traffic, the clothing for the
feet is what is most easily prepared to cheat the
eye of the inexperienced, the imposition having
the aids of heel-ball, &amp;c., to fill up crevices, and
of blacking to hide defects. Even when the
boots or shoes are so worn out that no one will
put a pair on his feet, though purchaseable for
about 1<i>d.</i>, the insoles are ripped out; the soles, if
there be a sufficiency of leather, are shaped into
insoles for children’s shoes, and these insoles are
sold in bundles of two dozen pairs at 2<i>d.</i> the
bundle. So long as the boot or shoe be not in many
holes, it can be cobblered up in Monmouth-street
or elsewhere. Of the “translating” business
transacted in those localities I had the following
interesting account from a man who was
lately engaged in it.</p>

<p>“Translation, as I understand it (said my informant),
is this&mdash;to take a worn, old pair of shoes
or boots, and by repairing them make them appear
as if left off with hardly any wear&mdash;as if they
were only soiled. I’ll tell you the way they
manage in Monmouth-street. There are in the
trade ‘horses’ heads’&mdash;a ‘horse’s head’ is the foot
of a boot with sole and heel, and part of a front&mdash;the
back and the remainder of the front having
been used for refooting boots. There are also
‘stand-bottoms’ and ‘lick-ups.’ A ‘stand-bottom’
is where the shoe appears to be only soiled, and a
‘lick-up’ is a boot or shoe re-lasted to take the
wrinkles out, the edges of the soles having been
rasped and squared, and then blacked up to hide
blemishes, and the bottom covered with a ‘smother,’
which I will describe. There is another
article called a ‘flyer,’ that is, a shoe soled without
having been welted. In Monmouth-street a
‘horse’s head’ is generally retailed at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but
some fetch 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;that’s the extreme price.
They cost the translator from 1<i>s.</i> a dozen pair to
8<i>s.</i>, but those at 8<i>s.</i> are good, and are used for
the making up of Wellington boots. Some
‘horses’ heads’&mdash;such as are cut off that the boots
may be re-footed on account of old fashion, or a
misfit, when hardly worn&mdash;fetch 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pair,
and they are made up as new-footed boots, and
sell from 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> The average price of feet
(that is, for the ‘horse’s head,’ as we call it) is
4<i>d.</i>, and a pair of backs say 2<i>d.</i>; the back is
attached loosely by chair stitching, as it is called,
to the heel, instead of being stitched to the in-sole,
as in a new boot. The wages for all this is
1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in Monmouth-street (in Union-street, Borough,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>); but I was told by a master that
he had got the work done in Gray’s-inn-lane at 9<i>d.</i>
Put it, however, at 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> wages&mdash;then, with 4<i>d.</i>
and 2<i>d.</i> for the feet and back, we have 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
outlay (the workman finds his own grindery), and
8<i>d.</i> profit on each pair sold at a rate of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
Some masters will sell from 70 to 80 pairs per
week: that’s under the mark; and that’s in
‘horses’ heads’ alone. One man employs, or did
lately employ, seven men on ‘horses’ heads’
solely. The profit generally, in fair shops, in
‘stand-bottoms,’ is from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per pair, as
they sell generally at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> One man takes, or
did take, 100<i>l.</i> in a day (it was calculated as an
average) over the counter, and all for the sort of
shoes I have described. The profit of a ‘lick-up’
is the same as that of a ‘stand-bottom.’ To show
the villanous way the ‘stand-bottoms’ are got
up, I will tell you this. You have seen a broken
upper-leather; well, we place a piece of leather,
waxed, underneath the broken part, on which we
set a few stitches through and through. When
dry and finished, we take what is called a ‘soft-heel-ball’
and ‘smother’ it over, so that it sometimes
would deceive a currier, as it appears like
the upper leather. With regard to the bottoms,
the worn part of the sole is opened from the edge,
a piece of leather is made to fit exactly into the
hole or worn part, and it is then nailed and filed
until level. Paste is then applied, and ‘smother’
put over the part, and that imitates the dust of the
road. This ‘smother’ is obtained from the dust
of the room. It is placed in a silk stocking, tied
at both ends, and then shook through, just like a
powder-puff, only we shake at both ends. It is
powdered out into our leather apron, and mixed
with a certain preparation which I will describe
to you (he did so), but I would rather not have
it published, as it would lead others to practise
similar deceptions. I believe there are about
2000 translators, so you may judge of the extent
of the trade; and translators are more constantly
employed than any other branch of the business.
Many make a great deal of money. A journeyman
translator can earn from 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> a day. You
can give the average at 20<i>s.</i> a week, as the wages
are good. It must be good, for we have 2<i>s.</i> for
soling, heeling, and welting a pair of boots; and
some men don’t get more for making them. Monmouth-street
is nothing like what it was; as to
curious old garments, that’s all gone. There’s
not one English master in the translating business
in Monmouth-street&mdash;they are all Irish; and
there is now hardly an English workman there&mdash;perhaps
not one. I believe that all the tradesmen in
Monmouth-street make their workmen lodge with
them. I was lodging with one before I married a
little while ago, and I know the system to be the
same now as it was then, unless, indeed, it be altered
for the worse. To show how disgusting these
lodgings must be, I will state this:&mdash;I knew a
Roman Catholic, who was attentive to his religious
duties, but when pronounced on the point of death,
and believing firmly that he was dying, he would
not have his priest administer extreme unction, for
the room was in such a filthy and revolting state
he would not allow him to see it. Five men
worked and slept in that room, and they were
working and sleeping there in the man’s illness&mdash;all
the time that his life was despaired of. He was
ill nine weeks. Unless the working shoemaker
lodged there he would not be employed. Each
man pays 2<i>s.</i> a week. I was there once, but I
couldn’t sleep in such a den; and five nights out
of the seven I slept at my mother’s, but my lodging
had to be paid all the same. These men
(myself excepted) were all Irish, and all tee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>totallers,
as was the master. How often was
the room cleaned out, do you say? Never, sir,
never. The refuse of the men’s labour was generally
burnt, smudged away in the grate, smelling
terribly. It would stifle you, though it didn’t me,
because I got used to it. I lodged in Union-street
once. My employer had a room known as the
‘barracks;’ every lodger paid him 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week.
Five men worked and slept there, and three were
<i>sitters</i>&mdash;that is, men who paid 1<i>s.</i> a week to sit
there and work, lodging elsewhere. A little before
that there were six sitters. The furniture
was one table, one chair, and two beds. There
was no place for purposes of decency: it fell to
bits from decay, and was never repaired. This
barrack man always stopped the 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for lodging,
if he gave you only that amount of work in
the week. The beds were decent enough; but
as to Monmouth-street! you don’t see a clean
sheet there for nine weeks; and, recollect, such
snobs are dirty fellows. There was no chair in
the Monmouth-street room that I have spoken of,
the men having only their seats used at work;
but when the beds were let down for the night,
the seats had to be placed in the fire-place because
there was no space for them in the room. In
many houses in Monmouth-street there is a system
of sub-letting among the journeymen. In one
room lodged a man and his wife (a laundress
worked there), four children, and two single
young men. The wife was actually delivered in
this room whilst the men kept at their work&mdash;they
never lost an hour’s work; nor is this an
unusual case&mdash;it’s not an isolated case at all. I
could instance ten or twelve cases of two or three
married people living in one room in that street.
The rats have scampered over the beds that lay
huddled together in the kitchen. The husband of
the wife confined as I have described paid 4<i>s.</i> a
week, and the two single men paid 2<i>s.</i> a week each,
so the master was rent free; and he received from
each man 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for tea (without sugar),
and no bread and butter, and 2<i>d.</i> a day for potatoes&mdash;that’s
the regular charge.”</p>

<p>In connection with the translation of old boots
and shoes, I have obtained the following statistics.

Dickens’ description of the Seven Dials, of which
Monmouth-street is a <span class="lock">seventh:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The stranger who finds himself in ‘The Dials’
for the first time, and stands, Belzoni-like, at the
entrance of seven obscure passages, uncertain
which to take, will see enough around him to
keep his curiosity and attention awake for no
inconsiderable time. From the irregular square
into which he has plunged, the streets and courts
dart in all directions, until they are lost in the
unwholesome vapour which hangs over the house-tops,
and renders the dirty perspective uncertain
and confined; and, lounging at every corner, as if
they came there to take a few gasps of such fresh
air as has found its way so far, but is too much
exhausted already, to be enabled to force itself
into the narrow alleys around, are groups of
people, whose appearance and dwellings would fill
any mind but a regular Londoner’s with astonishment.</p>

<p>“In addition to the numerous groups who are
idling about the gin-shops and squabbling in the
centre of the road, every post in the open space
has its occupant, who leans against it for hours,
with listless perseverance. It is odd enough that
one class of men in London appear to have no
enjoyment beyond leaning against posts. We
never saw a regular bricklayer’s labourer take any
other recreation, fighting excepted. Pass through
St. Giles’s in the evening of a week-day, there
they are in their fustian dresses, spotted with
brick-dust and whitewash, leaning against posts.
Walk through Seven Dials on Sunday morning:
there they are again, drab or light corduroy
trowsers, Blucher boots, blue coats, and great
yellow waistcoats, leaning against posts. The
idea of a man dressing himself in his best clothes,
to lean against a post all day!</p>

<p>“The peculiar character of these streets, and
the close resemblance each one bears to its neighbour,
by no means tends to decrease the bewilderment
in which the unexperienced wayfarer through
‘the Dials’ finds himself involved. He traverses
streets of dirty, straggling houses, with now and
then an unexpected court, composed of buildings
as ill-proportioned and deformed as the half-naked
children that wallow in the kennels. Here and
there, a little dark chandler’s shop, with a cracked
bell hung up behind the door to announce the entrance
of a customer, or betray the presence of
some young gentleman in whom a passion for shop
tills has developed itself at an early age; others,
as if for support, against some handsome lofty
building, which usurps the place of a low dingy
public-house; long rows of broken and patched
windows expose plants that may have flourished
when ‘The Dials’ were built, in vessels as dirty
as ‘The Dials’ themselves; and shops for the
purchase of rags, bones, old iron, and kitchen-stuff,
vie in cleanliness with the bird-fanciers and
rabbit-dealers, which one might fancy so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
arks, but for the irresistible conviction that no
bird in its proper senses, who was permitted to
leave one of them would ever come back again.
Brokers’ shops, which would seem to have been
established by humane individuals, as refuges for
destitute bugs, interspersed with announcements
of day-schools, penny theatres, petition-writers,
mangles, and music for balls or routs, complete the
‘still-life’ of the subject; and dirty men, filthy
women, squalid children, fluttering shuttlecocks,
noisy battledores, reeking pipes, bad fruit, more
than doubtful oysters, attenuated cats, depressed
dogs, and anatomical fowls, are its cheerful accompaniments.</p>

<p>“If the external appearance of the houses, or
a glance at their inhabitants, present but few attractions,
a closer acquaintance with either is little
calculated to alter one’s first impression. Every
room has its separate tenant, and every tenant is,
by the same mysterious dispensation which causes
a country curate to ‘increase and multiply’ most
marvellously, generally the head of a numerous
family.</p>

<p>“The man in the shop, perhaps, is in the baked
‘jemmy’ line, or the fire-wood and hearth-stone
line, or any other line which requires a floating
capital of eighteen pence or thereabouts: and he
and his family live in the shop, and the small back
parlour behind it. Then there is an Irish labourer
and <i>his</i> family in the back kitchen, and
a jobbing-man&mdash;carpet-beater and so forth&mdash;with
<i>his</i> family, in the front one. In the front
one pair there’s another man with another wife
and family, and in the back one-pair there’s ‘a
young ’oman as takes in tambour-work, and
dresses quite genteel,’ who talks a good deal
about ‘my friend,’ and can’t ‘abear anything low.’
The second floor front, and the rest of the lodgers,
are just a second edition of the people below, except
a shabby-genteel man in the back attic, who
has his half-pint of coffee every morning from the
coffee-shop next door but one, which boasts a little
front den called a coffee-room, with a fire-place,
over which is an inscription, politely requesting
that, ‘to prevent mistakes,’ customers will ‘please
to pay on delivery.’ The shabby-genteel man is
an object of some mystery, but as he leads a life
of seclusion, and never was known to buy anything
beyond an occasional pen, except half-pints
of coffee, penny loaves, and ha’porths of ink, his
fellow-lodgers very naturally suppose him to be an
author; and rumours are current in the Dials,
that he writes poems for Mr. Warren.</p>

<p>“Now any body who passed through the Dials
on a hot summer’s evening, and saw the different
women of the house gossiping on the steps, would
be apt to think that all was harmony among them,
and that a more primitive set of people than the
native Diallers could not be imagined. Alas! the
man in the shop illtreats his family; the carpet-beater
extends his professional pursuits to his wife;
the one-pair front has an undying feud with the
two-pair front, in consequence of the two-pair
front persisting in dancing over his (the one-pair
front’s) head, when he and his family have retired
for the night; the two-pair back <i>will</i> interfere
with the front kitchen’s children; the Irishman
comes home drunk every other night, and attacks
every body; and the one-pair back screams at
everything. Animosities spring up between floor
and floor; the very cellar asserts his equality.
Mrs. A. ‘smacks’ Mrs. B.’s child for ‘making
faces.’ Mrs. B. forthwith throws cold water over
Mrs. A.’s child for ‘calling names.’ The husbands
are embroiled&mdash;the quarrel becomes general&mdash;an
assault is the consequence, and a police-officer the
result.”</p>

<p>Of Monmouth-street the same author <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We have always entertained a particular
attachment towards Monmouth-street, as the only
true and real emporium for second-hand wearing
apparel. Monmouth-street is venerable from its
antiquity, and respectable from its usefulness.
Holywell-street we despise; the red-headed and
red-whiskered Jews who forcibly haul you into
their squalid houses, and thrust you into a suit of
clothes whether you will or not, we detest.</p>

<p>“The inhabitants of Monmouth-street are a
distinct class; a peaceable and retiring race, who
immure themselves for the most part in deep
cellars, or small back parlours, and who seldom
come forth into the world, except in the dusk and
coolness of evening, when they may be seen
seated, in chairs on the pavement, smoking their
pipes, or watching the gambols of their engaging
children as they revel in the gutter, a happy troop
of infantine scavengers. Their countenances bear
a thoughtful and a dirty cast, certain indications
of their love of traffic; and their habitations are
distinguished by that disregard of outward appearance,
and neglect of personal comfort, so
common among people who are constantly immersed
in profound speculations, and deeply engaged
in sedentary pursuits.</p>

<p>“Through every alteration and every change
Monmouth-street has still remained the burial-place
of the fashions; and such, to judge from all
present appearances, it will remain until there are
no more fashions to bury.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Petticoat and
Rosemary-Lanes.</span></h3>

<p>Immediately connected with the trade of the
central mart for old clothes are the adjoining streets
of Petticoat-lane, and those of the not very distant
Rosemary-lane. In these localities is a
second-hand garment-seller at almost every step,
but the whole stock of these traders, decent,
frowsy, half-rotten, or smart and good habiliments,
has first passed through the channel of the Exchange.
The men who sell these goods have all
bought them at the Exchange&mdash;the exceptions
being insignificant&mdash;so that this street-sale is but
an extension of the trade of the central mart,
with the addition that the wares have been made
ready for use.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SCENE IN PETTICOAT-LANE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A cursory observation might lead an inexperienced
person to the conclusion, that these old
clothes traders who are standing by the bundles of
gowns, or lines of coats, hanging from their door-posts,
or in the place from which the window has
been removed, or at the sides of their houses, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
piled in the street before them, are drowsy people,
for they seem to sit among their property, lost
in thought, or caring only for the fumes of a
pipe. But let any one indicate, even by an approving
glance, the likelihood of his becoming a
customer, and see if there be any lack of diligence
in business. Some, indeed, pertinaciously invite
attention to their wares; some (and often well-dressed
women) leave their premises a few yards
to accost a stranger pointing to a “good dress-coat”
or “an excellent frock” (coat). I am told
that this practice is less pursued than it was, and
it seems that the solicitations are now addressed
chiefly to strangers. These strangers, persons
happening to be passing, or visitors from curiosity,
are at once recognised; for as in all not very extended
localities, where the inhabitants pursue a
similar calling, they are, as regards their knowledge
of one another, as the members of one
family. Thus a stranger is as easily recognised
as he would be in a little rustic hamlet where
a strange face is not seen once a quarter.
Indeed so narrow are some of the streets and
alleys in this quarter, and so little is there of
privacy, owing to the removal, in warm weather,
even of the casements, that the room is commanded
in all its domestic details; and as among
these details there is generally a further display of
goods similar to the articles outside, the jammed-up
places really look like a great family house
with merely a sort of channel, dignified by the
name of a street, between the right and left suites
of apartments.</p>

<p>In one off-street, where on a Sunday there is a
considerable demand for Jewish sweet-meats by
Christian boys, and a little sly, and perhaps not
very successful gambling on the part of the ingenuous
youth to possess themselves of these confectionaries
at the easiest rate, there are some
mounds of builders’ rubbish upon which, if an inquisitive
person ascended, he could command the
details of the upper rooms, probably the bed
chambers&mdash;if in their crowded apartments these
traders can find spaces for beds.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that old clothes are
more than the great staple of the traffic of this
district. Wherever persons are assembled there
are certain to be purveyors of provisions and of
cool or hot drinks for warm or cold weather. The
interior of the Old Clothes Exchange has its
oyster-stall, its fountain of ginger-beer, its coffee-house,
and ale-house, and a troop of peripatetic
traders, boys principally, carrying trays. Outside
the walls of the Exchange this trade is still
thicker. A Jew boy thrusts a tin of highly-glazed
cakes and pastry under the people’s noses here;
and on the other side a basket of oranges regales
the same sense by its proximity. At the next
step the thoroughfare is interrupted by a gaudy-looking
ginger-beer, lemonade, raspberryade, and
nectar fountain; “a halfpenny a glass, a halfpenny
a glass, sparkling lemonade!” shouts the vendor
as you pass. The fountain and the glasses glitter
in the sun, the varnish of the wood-work shines,
the lemonade really does sparkle, and all looks
clean&mdash;except the owner. Close by is a brawny
young Irishman, his red beard unshorn for perhaps
ten days, and his neck, where it had been
exposed to the weather, a far deeper red than his
beard, and he is carrying a small basket of nuts,
and selling them as gravely as if they were articles
suited to his strength. A little lower is the cry,
in a woman’s voice, “Fish, fried fish! Ha’penny;
fish, fried fish!” and so monotonously and mechanically
is it ejaculated that one might think
the seller’s life was passed in uttering these few
words, even as a rook’s is in crying “Caw, caw.”
Here I saw a poor Irishwoman who had a child
on her back buy a piece of this fish (which may
be had “hot” or “cold”), and tear out a piece
with her teeth, and this with all the eagerness and
relish of appetite or hunger; first eating the
brown outside and then <i>sucking</i> the bone. I never
saw fish look firmer or whiter. That fried fish is
to be procured is manifest to more senses than
one, for you can hear the sound of its being fried,
and smell the fumes from the oil. In an open
window opposite frizzle on an old tray, small
pieces of thinly-cut meat, with a mixture of
onions, kept hot by being placed over an old pan
containing charcoal. In another room a mess of
batter is smoking over a grate. “Penny a lot,
oysters,” resounds from different parts. Some of
the sellers command two streets by establishing
their stalls or tubs at a corner. Lads pass, carrying
sweet-stuff on trays. I observed one very
dark-eyed Hebrew boy chewing the hard-bake he
vended&mdash;if it were not a substitute&mdash;with an expression
of great enjoyment. Heaped-up trays
of fresh-looking sponge-cakes are carried in tempting
pyramids. Youths have stocks of large hard-looking
biscuits, and walk about crying, “Ha’penny
biscuits, ha’penny; three a penny, biscuits;”
these, with a morsel of cheese, often supply a
dinner or a luncheon. Dates and figs, as dry as
they are cheap, constitute the stock in trade of
other street-sellers. “Coker-nuts” are sold in
pieces and entire; the Jew boy, when he invites
to the purchase of an entire nut, shaking it at
the ear of the customer. I was told by a costermonger
that these juveniles had a way of drumming
with their fingers on the shell so as to
satisfy a “green” customer that the nut offered
was a sound one.</p>

<p>Such are the summer eatables and drinkables
which I have lately seen vended in the Petticoat-lane
district. In winter there are, as long as daylight
lasts&mdash;and in no other locality perhaps does
it last so short a time&mdash;other street provisions,
and, if possible, greater zeal in selling them, the
hours of business being circumscribed. There is
then the potato-can and the hot elder-wine apparatus,
and smoking pies and puddings, and roasted
apples and chestnuts, and walnuts, and the several
fruits which ripen in the autumn&mdash;apples, pears,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have spoken only of such eatables
and drinkables as are ready for consumption, but
to these the trade in the Petticoat-lane district
is by no means confined. There is fresh fish,
generally of the cheaper kinds, and smoked or
dried fish (smoked salmon, moreover, is sold ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cooked), and costermongers’ barrows, with their
loads of green vegetables, looking almost out of
place amidst the surrounding dinginess. The cries
of “Fine cauliflowers,” “Large penny cabbages,”
“Eight a shilling, mackarel,” “Eels, live eels,”
mix strangely with the hubbub of the busier
street.</p>

<p>Other street-sellers also abound. You meet one
man who says mysteriously, and rather bluntly,
“Buy a good knife, governor.” His tone is remarkable,
and if it attract attention, he may hint
that he has smuggled goods which he <i>must</i> sell
anyhow. Such men, I am told, look out mostly
for seamen, who often resort to Petticoat-lane;
for idle men like sailors on shore, and idle uncultivated
men often love to lounge where there is
bustle. Pocket and pen knives and scissors,
“Penny a piece, penny a pair,” rubbed over with
oil, both to hide and prevent rust, are carried on
trays, and spread on stalls, some stalls consisting
of merely a tea-chest lid on a stool. Another
man, carrying perhaps a sponge in his hand, and
well-dressed, asks you, in a subdued voice, if you
want a good razor, as if he almost suspected that
you meditated suicide, and were looking out for
the means! This is another ruse to introduce
smuggled (or “duffer’s”) goods. Account-books
are hawked. “Penny-a-quire,” shouts the itinerant
street stationer (who, if questioned, always declares
he said “Penny half quire”). “Stockings,
stockings, two pence a pair.” “Here’s your
chewl-ry; penny, a penny; pick ’em and choose
’em.” [I may remark that outside the window
of one shop, or rather parlour, if there be any such
distinction here, I saw the handsomest, as far as
I am able to judge, and the best cheap jewellery I
ever saw in the streets.] “Pencils, sir, pencils;
steel-pens, steel-pens; ha’penny, penny; pencils,
steel-pens; sealing-wax, wax, wax, wax!” shouts
one, “Green peas, ha’penny a pint!” cries another.</p>

<p>These things, however, are but the accompaniments
of the main traffic. But as such things
accompany all traffic, not on a small scale, and
may be found in almost every metropolitan thoroughfare,
where the police are not required, by
the householders, to interfere, I will point out, to
show the distinctive character of the street-trade
in this part, what is <i>not</i> sold and not encouraged.
I saw no old books. There were no flowers; no
music, which indeed could not be heard except at
the outskirts of the din; and no beggars plying
their vocation among the trading class.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity pertaining alike to this shop
and street locality is, that everything is at the veriest
minimum of price; though it may not be asked, it
will assuredly be taken. The bottle of lemonade
which is elsewhere a penny is here a halfpenny.
The tarts, which among the street-sellers about the
Royal Exchange are a halfpenny each, are here
a farthing. When lemons are two a-penny in
St. George’s-market, Oxford-street, as the long
line of street stalls towards the western extremity
is called&mdash;they are three and four a-penny in
Petticoat and Rosemary lanes. Certainly there
is a difference in size between the dearer and the
cheaper tarts and lemons, and perhaps there is a
difference in quality also, but the rule of a minimized
cheapness has no exceptions in this cheap-trading
quarter.</p>

<p>But Petticoat-lane is essentially the old clothes
district. Embracing the streets and alleys adjacent
to Petticoat-lane, and including the rows of
old boots and shoes on the ground, there is
perhaps between two and three miles of old clothes.
Petticoat-lane proper is long and narrow, and to look
down it is to look down a vista of many coloured
garments, alike on the sides and on the ground. The
effect sometimes is very striking, from the variety
of hues, and the constant flitting, or gathering, of
the crowd into little groups of bargainers. Gowns
of every shade and every pattern are hanging up,
but none, perhaps, look either bright or white; it
is a vista of dinginess, but many coloured dinginess,
as regards female attire. Dress coats, frock
coats, great coats, livery and game-keepers’ coats,
paletots, tunics, trowsers, knee-breeches, waistcoats,
capes, pilot coats, working jackets, plaids,
hats, dressing gowns, shirts, Guernsey frocks, are
all displayed. The predominant colours are black
and blue, but there is every colour; the light drab
of some aristocratic livery; the dull brown-green
of velveteen; the deep blue of a pilot jacket; the
variegated figures of the shawl dressing-gown; the
glossy black of the restored garments; the shine
of newly turpentined black satin waistcoats; the
scarlet and green of some flaming tartan; these
things&mdash;mixed with the hues of the women’s
garments, spotted and striped&mdash;certainly present
a scene which cannot be beheld in any other part
of the greatest city of the world, nor in any other
portion of the world itself.</p>

<p>The ground has also its array of colours. It is
covered with lines of boots and shoes, their shining
black relieved here and there by the admixture
of females’ boots, with drab, green, plum or
lavender-coloured “legs,” as the upper part of the
boot is always called in the trade. There is, too,
an admixture of men’s “button-boots” with drab
cloth legs; and of a few red, yellow, and russet
coloured slippers; and of children’s coloured morocco
boots and shoes. Handkerchiefs, sometimes
of a gaudy orange pattern, are heaped on a chair.
Lace and muslins occupy small stands or are
spread on the ground. Black and drab and straw
hats are hung up, or piled one upon another and
kept from falling by means of strings; while, incessantly
threading their way through all this
intricacy, is a mass of people, some of whose
dresses speak of a recent purchase in the lane.</p>

<p>I have said little of the shopkeepers of Petticoat-lane,
nor is it requisite for the full elucidation
of my present subject (which relates more
especially to <i>street-sale</i>), that I should treat of
them otherwise than as being in a great degree
connected with street-trade. They stand in the
street (in front of their premises), they trade in
the street, they smoke and read the papers in the
street; and indeed the greater part of their lives
seems passed in the street, for, as I have elsewhere
remarked, the Saturday’s or Sabbath’s recreation
to some of them, after synagogue hours, seems to
be to stand by their doors looking about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In the earlier periods of the day&mdash;the Jewish
Sabbath excepted, when there is no market at all
in Petticoat-lane, not even among the Irish and
other old clothes people, or a mere nothing of a
market&mdash;the goods of these shops seem consigned
to the care of the wives and female members of the
families of the proprietors. The Old Clothes Exchange,
like other places known by the name&mdash;the
Royal Exchange, for example&mdash;has its daily
season of “high change.” This is, in summer,
from about half-past two to five, in winter, from
two to four o’clock. At those hours the crockman,
and the bartering costermonger, and the Jew
collector, have sought the Exchange with their
respective bargains; and business there, and in the
whole district, is at its fullest tide. Before this
hour the master of the shop or <i>store</i> (the latter
may be the more appropriate word) is absent
buying, collecting, or transacting any business
which requires him to leave home. It is curious
to observe how, during this absence, the women,
but with most wary eyes to the business, sit in
the street carrying on their domestic occupations.
Some, with their young children about them, are
shelling peas; some are trimming vegetables;
some plying their needles; some of the smaller
traders’ wives, as well as the street-sellers with a
“pitch,” are eating dinners out of basins (laid
aside when a customer approaches), and occasionally
some may be engaged in what Mrs. Trollope
has called (in noticing a similar procedure in the
boxes of an American theatre) “the most maternal
of all offices.” The females I saw thus occupied
were principally Jewesses, for though those resorting
to the Old Clothes Exchange and its concomitant
branches may be but one-fourth Jews,
more than half of the remainder being Irish
people, the householders or shopkeepers of the
locality, when capital is needed, are generally
Israelites.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that, in describing
Petticoat-lane, I have described it as seen on a
fine summer’s day, when the business is at its
height. Until an hour or two after midday the
district is quiet, and on very rainy days its aspect
is sufficiently lamentable, for then it appears
actually deserted. Perhaps on a winter’s Saturday
night&mdash;as the Jewish Sabbath terminates at sunset&mdash;the
scene may be the most striking of all.
The flaring lights from uncovered gas, from fat-fed
lamps, from the paper-shaded candles, and the
many ways in which the poorer street-folk throw
some illumination over their goods, produce a
multiplicity of lights and shadows, which, thrown
and blended over the old clothes hanging up along
the line of street, cause them to assume mysterious
forms, and if the wind be high make them, as they
are blown to and fro, look more mysterious still.</p>

<p>On one of my visits to Petticoat-lane I saw
two foreign Jews&mdash;from Smyrna I was informed.
An old street-seller told me he believed it was
their first visit to the district. But, new as the
scene might be to them, they looked on impassively
at all they saw. They wore the handsome
and peculiar dresses of their country. A glance
was cast after them by the Petticoat-lane people,
but that was all. In the Strand they would have
attracted considerable attention; not a few heads
would have been turned back to gaze after them;
but it seems that only to those who may possibly
be customers is any notice paid in Petticoat-lane.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rosemary-lane.</span></h3>

<p>Rosemary-lane, which has in vain been re-christened
Royal Mint-street, is from half to three-quarters
of a mile long&mdash;that is, if we include
only the portion which runs from the junction of
Leman and Dock streets (near the London Docks)
to Sparrow-corner, where it abuts on the Minories.
Beyond the Leman-street termination of Rosemary-lane,
and stretching on into Shadwell, are
many streets of a similar character as regards the
street and shop supply of articles to the poor;
but as the old clothes trade is only occasionally
carried on there, I shall here deal with Rosemary-lane
proper.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 565px;">

<div class="caption"><p>A VIEW IN ROSEMARY-LANE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This lane partakes of some of the characteristics
of Petticoat-lane, but without its so strongly
marked peculiarities. Rosemary-lane is wider and
airier, the houses on each side are loftier (in several
parts), and there is an approach to a gin
palace, a thing unknown in Petticoat-lane: there
is no room for such a structure there.</p>

<p>Rosemary-lane, like the quarter I have last
described, has its off-streets, into which the traffic
stretches. Some of these off-streets are narrower,
dirtier, poorer in all respects than Rosemary-lane
itself, which indeed can hardly be stigmatized as
very dirty. These are Glasshouse-street, Russell-court,
Hairbrine-court, Parson’s-court, Blue
Anchor-yard (one of the poorest places and with
a half-built look), Darby-street, Cartwright-street,
Peter’s-court, Princes-street, Queen-street, and beyond
these and in the direction of the Minories,
Rosemary-lane becomes Sharp’s-buildings and
Sparrow-corner. There are other small non-thoroughfare
courts, sometimes called blind alleys,
to which no name is attached, but which are very
well known to the neighbourhood as Union-court,
&amp;c.; but as these are not scenes of street-traffic,
although they may be the abodes of street-traffickers,
they require no especial notice.</p>

<p>The dwellers in the neighbourhood or the off-streets
of Rosemary-lane, differ from those of
Petticoat-lane by the proximity of the former
place to the Thames. The lodgings here are
occupied by dredgers, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers,
watermen, lumpers, and others whose trade
is connected with the river, as well as the slop-workers
and sweaters working for the Minories.
The poverty of these workers compels them to
lodge wherever the rent of the rooms is the
lowest. As a few of the wives of the ballast-heavers,
&amp;c., are street-sellers in or about Rosemary-lane,
the locality is often sought by them.
About Petticoat-lane the off-streets are mostly
occupied by the old clothes merchants.</p>

<p>In Rosemary-lane is a greater <i>street</i>-trade, as
regards things placed on the ground for retail sale,
&amp;c., than in Petticoat-lane; for though the traffic
in the last-mentioned lane is by far the greatest,
it is more connected with the shops, and fewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
traders whose dealings are strictly those of the
street alone resort to it. Rosemary-lane, too, is
more Irish. There are some cheap lodging-houses
in the courts, &amp;c., to which the poor Irish flock;
and as they are very frequently street-sellers, on
busy days the quarter abounds with them. At every
step you hear the Erse tongue, and meet with the
Irish physiognomy; Jews and Jewesses are also
seen in the street, and they abound in the shops.
The street-traffic does not begin until about one
o’clock, except as regards the vegetable, fish, and
oyster-stalls, &amp;c.; but the chief business of this
lane, which is as inappropriately as that of Petticoat
is suitably named, is in the vending of the
articles which have often been thrown aside as
refuse, but from which numbers in London wring
an existence.</p>

<p>One side of the lane is covered with old boots
and shoes; old clothes, both men’s, women’s, and
children’s; new lace for edgings, and a variety of
cheap prints and muslins (also new); hats and
bonnets; pots, and often of the commonest kinds;
tins; old knives and forks, old scissors, and old
metal articles generally; here and there is a stall
of cheap bread or American cheese, or what is
announced as American; old glass; different descriptions
of second-hand furniture of the smaller
size, such as children’s chairs, bellows, &amp;c. Mixed
with these, but only very scantily, are a few bright-looking
swag-barrows, with china ornaments, toys,
&amp;c. Some of the wares are spread on the ground
on wrappers, or pieces of matting or carpet; and
some, as the pots, are occasionally placed on straw.
The cotton prints are often heaped on the ground;
where are also ranges or heaps of boots and shoes,
and piles of old clothes, or hats, or umbrellas.
Other traders place their goods on stalls or barrows,
or over an old chair or clothes-horse. And
amidst all this motley display the buyers and
sellers smoke, and shout, and doze, and bargain,
and wrangle, and eat and drink tea and coffee,
and sometimes beer. Altogether Rosemary-lane is
more of a <i>street</i> market than is Petticoat-lane.</p>

<p>This district, like the one I have first described,
is infested with young thieves and vagrants from
the neighbouring lodging-houses, who may be seen
running about, often bare-footed, bare-necked, and
shirtless, but “larking” one with another, and
what may be best understood as “full of fun.”
In what way these lads dispose of their plunder,
and how their plunder is in any way connected
with the trade of these parts, I shall show in my
account of the Thieves. One pickpocket told me
that there was no person whom he delighted so
much to steal from as any Petticoat-laner with
whom he had professional dealings!</p>

<p>In Rosemary-lane there is a busy Sunday morning
trade; there is a street-trade, also, on the
Saturday afternoons, but the greater part of the
shops are then closed, and the Jews do not participate
in the commerce until after sunset.</p>

<p>The two marts I have thus fully described differ
from all other street-markets, for in these two
second-hand garments, and second-hand merchandize
generally (although but in a small proportion),
are the grand staple of the traffic. At the other
street-markets, the second-hand commerce is the
exception.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Men’s Second-hand
Clothes.</span></h3>

<p>In the following accounts of street-selling, I shall
not mix up any account of the retailers’ modes of
buying, collecting, repairing, or “restoring” the second-hand
garments, otherwise than incidentally. I
have already sketched the systems pursued, and
more will have to be said concerning them under the
head of <span class="smcap">Street-Buyers</span>. Neither have I thought
it necessary, in the further accounts I have collected,
to confine myself to the trade carried on in
the Petticoat and Rosemary-lane districts. The
greater portion relates to those places, but my aim,
of course, is to give an account which will show
the character of the second-hand trade of the metropolis
generally.</p>

<p>“People should remember,” said an intelligent
shoemaker (not a street-seller) with whom I had
some conversation about cobbling for the streets,
“that such places as Rosemary-lane have their
uses this way. But for them a very poor industrious
widow, say, with only 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> to spare,
couldn’t get a pair of shoes for her child; whereas
now, for 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i>, she can get them there, of
some sort or other. There’s a sort of decency,
too, in wearing shoes. And what’s more, sir&mdash;for
I’ve bought old coats and other clothes in Rosemary-lane,
both for my own wear and my family’s,
and know something about it&mdash;how is a poor creature
to get such a decency as a petticoat for a poor
little girl, if she’d only a penny, unless there were
such places?”</p>

<p>In the present state of the very poor, it may be
that such places as those described have, on the
principle that half a loaf is better than no bread,
their benefits. But whether the state of things in
which an industrious widow, or a host of industrious
persons, <i>can</i> spare but 1<i>d.</i> for a child’s
clothing (and nothing, perhaps, for their own), is
one to be lauded in a Christian country, is another
question, fraught with grave political and social
considerations.</p>

<p>The man from whom I received the following
account of the sale of men’s wearing apparel was
apparently between 30 and 40 years of age. His
face presented something of the Jewish physiognomy,
but he was a Christian, he said, though he
never had time to go to church or chapel, and
Sunday was often a busy day; besides, a man
must live as others in his way lived. He had
been connected with the sale of old clothes all
his life, as were his parents, so that his existence
had been monotonous enough, for he had never
been more than five miles, he thought, from
Whitechapel, the neighbourhood where he was
born. In winter he liked a concert, and was fond
of a hand at cribbage, but he didn’t care for the
play. His goods he sometimes spread on the
ground&mdash;at other times he had a stall or a “horse”
(clothes-horse).</p>

<p>“My customers,” he said, “are nearly all
working people, some of them very poor, and
with large families. For anything I know, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of them works with their heads, though, as well,
and not their hands, for I’ve noticed that their
hands is smallish and seems smoothish, and suits
a tight sleeve very well. I don’t know what
they are. How should I? I asks no questions,
and they’ll tell me no fibs. To such as them I
sell coats mostly; indeed, very little else. They’re
often very perticler about the fit, and often asks,
‘Does it look as if it was made for me?’ Sometimes
they is seedy, very seedy, and comes to
such as me, most likely, ’cause we’re cheaper
than the shops. They don’t like to try things on
in the street, and I can always take a decent
customer, or one as looks sich, in there, to try on
(pointing to a coffee-shop). Bob-tailed coats
(dress-coats) is far the cheapest. I’ve sold them
as low as 1<i>s.</i>, but not often; at 2<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> often
enough; and sometimes as high as 5<i>s.</i> Perhaps
a 3<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> coat goes off as well as any, but
bob-tailed coats is little asked for. Now, I’ve
never had a frock (surtout or frock coat), as well
as I can remember, under 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, except one that
stuck by me a long time, and I sold it at last for
20<i>d.</i>, which was 2<i>d.</i> less than what it cost. It
was only a poor thing, in course, but it had such
a rum-coloured velvet collar, that was faded, and
had had a bit let in, and was all sorts of shades,
and that hindered its selling, I fancy. Velvet
collars isn’t worn now, and I’m glad of it. Old
coats goes better with their own collars (collars of
the same cloth as the body of the coat). For
frocks, I’ve got as much as 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and cheap at
it too, sir. Well, perhaps (laughing) at an odd
time they wasn’t so very cheap, but that’s all in
the way of trade. About 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> is perhaps
the ticket that a frock goes off best at. It’s
working people that buys frocks most, and often
working people’s wives or mothers&mdash;that is as far
as I knows. They’re capital judges as to what’ll
fit their men; and if they satisfy me it’s all right,
I’m always ready to undertake to change it for
another if it don’t fit. O, no, I never agree to
give back the money if it don’t fit; in course
not; that wouldn’t be business.</p>

<p>“No, sir, we’re very little troubled with people
larking. I have had young fellows come, half
drunk, even though it might be Sunday morning,
and say, ‘Guv’ner, what’ll you give me to wear
that coat for you, and show off your cut?’ We
don’t stand much of their nonsense. I don’t
know what such coves are. Perhaps ’torneys’
journeymen, or pot-boys out for a Sunday morning’s
spree.” [This was said with a bitterness
that surprised me in so quiet-speaking a man.]
“In greatcoats and cloaks I don’t do much, but
it’s a very good sale when you can offer them
well worth the money. I’ve got 10<i>s.</i> often for
a greatcoat, and higher and lower, oftener
lower in course; but 10<i>s.</i> is about the card for a
good thing. It’s the like with cloaks. Paletots
don’t sell well. They’re mostly thinner and
poorer cloth to begin with at the tailors&mdash;them
new-fashioned named things often is so&mdash;and so
they show when hard worn. Why no, sir, they can
be done up, certainly; anything can be touched
up; but they get thin, you see, and there’s nothing
to work upon as there is in a good cloth
greatcoat. You’ll excuse me, sir, but I saw you
a little bit since take one of them there square
books that a man gives away to people coming
this way, as if to knock up the second-hand
business, but he won’t, though; I’ll tell you how
them slops, if they come more into wear, is sure
to injure us. If people gets to wear them low-figured
things, more and more, as they possibly
may, why where’s the second-hand things to
come from? I’m not a tailor, but I understands
about clothes, and I believe that no person ever
saw anything green in my eye. And if you find
a slop thing marked a guinea, I don’t care what
it is, but I’ll undertake that you shall get one
that’ll wear longer, and look better to the very
last, second-hand, at less than half the money,
plenty less. It was good stuff and good make at
first, and hasn’t been abused, and that’s the
reason why it always bangs a slop, because it was
good to begin with.</p>

<p>“Trousers sells pretty well. I sell them, cloth
ones, from 6<i>d.</i> up to 4<i>s.</i> They’re cheaper if
they’re not cloth, but very seldom less or so low
as 6<i>d.</i> Yes, the cloth ones at that is poor worn
things, and little things too. They’re not men’s,
they’re youth’s or boy’s size. Good strong cords
goes off very well at 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or higher.
Irish bricklayers buys them, and paviours, and
such like. It’s easy to fit a man with a pair of
second-hand trousers. I can tell by his build
what’ll fit him directly. Tweeds and summer
trousers is middling, but washing things sells
worse and worse. It’s an expense, and expenses
don’t suit my customers&mdash;not a bit of it.</p>

<p>“Waistcoats isn’t in no great call. They’re
often worn very hard under any sort of a tidy
coat, for a tidy coat can be buttoned over anything
that’s ‘dicky,’ and so, you see, many of
’em’s half-way to the rag-shop before they comes
to us. Well, I’m sure I can hardly say what
sort of people goes most for weskets” [so he pronounced
it]. “If they’re light, or there’s anything
‘fancy’ about them, I thinks it’s mothers
as makes them up for their sons. What with the
strings at the back and such like, it aint hard to
make a wesket fit. They’re poor people as
buys certainly, but genteel people buys such things
as fancy weskets, or how do you suppose they’d
all be got through? O, there’s ladies comes here
for a bargain, I can tell you, and gentlemen, too;
and many on ’em would go through fire for one.
Second-hand satins (waistcoats) is good still, but
they don’t fetch the tin they did. I’ve sold weskets
from 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> Well, it’s hard to say
what the three-ha’pennies is made of; all sorts of
things; we calls them ‘serge.’ Three-pence is a
common price for a little wesket. There’s no
under-weskets wanted now, and there’s no rolling
collars. It was better for us when there was, as
there was more stuff to work on. The double-breasted
gets scarcer, too. Fashions grows to be
cheap things now-a-days.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you anything about knee-breeches;
they don’t come into my trade, and they’re never
asked for. Gaiters is no go either. Liveries isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a street-trade. I fancy all those sort of things
is sent abroad. I don’t know where. Perhaps
where people doesn’t know they was liveries. I
wouldn’t wear an old livery coat, if it was the
Queen’s, for five bob. I don’t think wearing one
would hinder trade. You may have seen a black
man in a fine livery giving away bills of a slop in
Holborn. If we was to have such a thing we’d
be pulled up (apprehended) for obstructing.</p>

<p>“I sells a few children’s (children’s clothes),
but only a few, and I can’t say so much about
them. They sells pretty freely though, and to
very decent people. If they’re good, then they’re
ready for use. If they ain’t anything very prime,
they can be mended&mdash;that is, if they was good to
begin with. But children’s woollen togs is mostly
hardworn and fit only for the ‘devil’ (the machine
which tears them up for shoddy). I’ve sold suits,
which was tunics and trousers, but no weskets,
for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> when they was tidy. That’s a common
price.</p>

<p>“Well, really, I hardly know how much I
make every week; far too little, I know that. I
could no more tell you how many coats I sell in a
year, or how many weskets, than I could tell you
how many days was fine, and how many wasn’t.
I can carry all in my head, and so I keeps no
accounts. I know exactly what every single
thing I sell has cost me. In course I must know
<i>that</i>. I dare say I may clear about 12<i>s.</i> bad
weeks, and 18<i>s.</i> good weeks, more and less both
ways, and there’s more bad weeks than good. I
have cleared 50<i>s.</i> in a good week; and when it’s
been nothing but fog and wet, I haven’t cleared
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> But mine’s a better business than common,
perhaps. I can’t say what others clears;
more and less than I does.”</p>

<p>The profit in this trade, from the best information
I could obtain, runs about 50 per cent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand
Boots and Shoes.</span></h3>

<p>The man who gave me the following account of
this trade had been familiar with it a good many
years, fifteen he believed, but was by no means
certain. I saw at his lodgings a man who was
finishing his day’s work there, in cobbling and
“translating.” He was not in the employ of my
informant, who had two rooms, or rather a floor;
he slept in one and let the other to the “translator”
who was a relation, he told me, and they
went on very well together, as he (the street-seller)
liked to sit and smoke his pipe of a night
in the translator’s room, which was much larger
than his own; and sometimes, when times were
“pretty bobbish,” they clubbed together for a
good supper of tripe, or had a “prime hot Jemmy
a-piece,” with a drop of good beer. A “Jemmy”
is a baked sheep’s head. The room was tidy
enough, but had the strong odour of shoemaker’s
wax proper to the craft.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in a good many street-trades, and
others too,” said my informant, “since you want
to know, and for a good purpose as well as I can
understand it. I was a ’prentice to a shoemaker
in Northampton, with a lot more; why, it was
more like a factory than anything else, was my
master’s, and the place we worked in was so confined
and hot, and we couldn’t open the window,
that it was worse than the East Ingees. O, I
know what they is. I’ve been there. I was so
badly treated I ran away from my master, for I
had only a father, and he cared nothing about me,
and so I broke my indentures. After a good bit
of knocking about and living as I could, and
starving when I couldn’t, but I never thought of
going back to Northampton, I ’listed and was a
good bit in the Ingees. Well, never mind, sir,
how long, or what happened me when I was
soldier. I did nothing wrong, and that ain’t what
you was asking about, and I’d rather say no more
about it.”</p>

<p>I have met with other street-folk, who had
been soldiers, and who were fond of talking of
their “service,” often enough to grumble about it,
so that I am almost tempted to think my informant
had deserted, but I questioned him no
further on the subject.</p>

<p>“I had my ups and downs again, sir,” he continued,
“when I got back to England. God bless
us all; I’m very fond of children, but I never
married, and when I’ve been at the worst, I’ve
been really glad that I hadn’t no one depending
on me. It’s bad enough for oneself, but when
there’s others as you must love, what must it be
then? I’ve smoked a pipe when I was troubled
in mind, and couldn’t get a meal, but could only
get a pipe, and baccy’s shamefully dear here; but
if I’d had a young daughter now, what good would
it have been my smoking a pipe to comfort her?
I’ve seen that in people that’s akin to me, and has
been badly off, and with families. I had a friend
or two in London, and I applied to them when I
couldn’t hold out no longer, and they gave me a
bit of a rise, so I began as a costermonger. I was
living among them as was in that line. Well, now,
it’s a pleasant life in fine weather. Why it was
only this morning Joe (the translator) was reading
the paper at breakfast time;&mdash;he gets it from the
public-house, and if it’s two, three, or four days
old, it’s just as good for us;&mdash;and there was
10,000 pines had been received from the West
Ingees. There’s a chance for the costermongers,
says I, if they don’t go off too dear. Then cherries
is in; and I was beginning to wish I was a
costermonger myself still, but my present trade is
<i>surer</i>. My boots and shoes’ll keep. They don’t
spoil in hot weather. Cherries and strawberries
does, and if it comes thunder and wet, you can’t
sell. I worked a barrow, and sometimes had only
a bit of a pitch, for a matter of two year, perhaps,
and then I got into this trade, as I understood it.
I sells all sorts, but not so much women’s or
children’s.</p>

<p>“Why, as to prices, there’s two sorts of prices.
You may sell as you buy, or you may sell new
soled and heeled. They’re never new welted for
the streets. It wouldn’t pay a bit. Not long
since I had a pair of very good Oxonians that had
been new welted, and the very first day I had
them on sale&mdash;it was a dull drizzly day&mdash;a lad
tried to prig them. I just caught him in time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Did I give him in charge? I hope I’ve more sense.
I’ve been robbed before, and I’ve caught young
rips in the act. If it’s boots or shoes they’ve
tried to prig, I gives them a stirruping with whichever
it is, and a kick, and lets them go.</p>

<p>“Men’s shoes, the regular sort, isn’t a very
good sale. I get from 10<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pair; but
the high priced ’uns is either soled and heeled,
and mudded well, or they’ve been real well-made
things, and not much worn. I’ve had gentlemen’s
shooting-shoes sometimes, that’s flung aside
for the least thing. The plain shoes don’t go off
at all. I think people likes something to cover
their stocking-feet more. For cloth button-boots
I get from 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;that’s the lowest I ever sold at&mdash;to
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The price is according to what condition
the things is in, and what’s been done to
them, but there’s no regular price. They’re not
such good sale as they would be, because they
soon show worn. The black ‘legs’ gets to look
very seamy, and it’s a sort of boot that won’t
stand much knocking about, if it ain’t right well
made at first. I’ve been selling Oxonian button-overs
(‘Oxonian’ shoes, which cover the instep,
and are closed by being buttoned instead of being
stringed through four or five holes) at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and
4<i>s.</i> but they was really good, and soled and
heeled; others I sell at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> or
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Bluchers is from 1<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Wellingtons
from 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;yes, indeed, I’ve had them as low
as 1<i>s.</i>, and perhaps they weren’t very cheap at
that, them very low-priced things never is, neither
new nor old&mdash;from 1<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>; but Wellingtons is
more for the shops than the street. I do a little
in children’s boots and shoes. I sell them from
3<i>d.</i> to 15<i>d.</i> Yes, you can buy lower than 3<i>d.</i>,
but I’m not in that way. They sell quite as
quick, or quicker, than anything. I’ve sold
children’s boots to poor women that wanted shoeing
far worse than the child; aye, many a time,
sir. Top boots (they’re called ‘Jockeys’ in the
trade) isn’t sold in the streets. I’ve never had
any, and I don’t see them with others in my line.
O no, there’s no such thing as Hessians or back-straps
(a top-boot without the light-coloured top)
in my trade now. Yes, I always have a seat
handy where anybody can try on anything in the
street; no, sir, no boot-hooks nor shoe-horn; shoe-horns
is rather going out, I think. If what we
sell in the streets won’t go on without them they
won’t be sold at all. A good many will buy if
the thing’s only big enough&mdash;they can’t bear
pinching, and don’t much care for a fine fit.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I take from 30<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i> a
week, 14<i>s.</i> is about my profit&mdash;that’s as to the
year through.</p>

<p>“I sell little for women’s wear, though I do sell
their boots and shoes sometimes.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Old Hats.</span></h3>

<p>The two street-sellers of old coats, waistcoats,
and trousers, and of boots and shoes, whose statements
precede this account, confined their trade,
generally, to the second-hand merchandize I
have mentioned as more especially constituting
their stock. But this arrangement does not
wholly prevail. There are many street-traders
“in second-hand,” perhaps two-thirds of the whole
number, who sell indiscriminately anything which
they can buy, or what they hope to turn out an
advantage; but even they prefer to deal more in
one particular kind of merchandize than another,
and this is most of all the case as concerns the
street-sale of old boots and shoes. Hats, however,
are among the second-hand wares which the
street-seller rarely vends unconnected with other
stock. I was told that this might be owing to the
hats sold in the streets being usually suitable only
for one class, grown men; while clothes and boots
and shoes are for boys as well as men. Caps may
supersede the use of hats, but nothing can supersede
the use of boots or shoes, which form the
<i>steadiest</i> second-hand street-trade of any.</p>

<p>There are, however, occasions, when a street-seller
exerts himself to become possessed of a
cheap stock of hats, by the well-known process of
“taking a quantity,” and sells them without, or
with but a small admixture of other goods. One
man who had been lately so occupied, gave me
the following account. He was of Irish parentage,
but there was little distinctive in his <span class="lock">accent:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Hats,” he said, “are about the awkwardest
things of any for the streets. Do as you will,
they require a deal of room, so that what you’ll
mostly see isn’t hats quite ready to put on your
head and walk away in, but to be made ready.
I’ve sold hats that way though, I mean ready to
wear, and my father before me has sold hundreds&mdash;yes,
I’ve been in the trade all my life&mdash;and it’s
the best way for a profit. You get, perhaps, the
old hat in, or you buy it at 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> as may be,
and so you kill two birds. But there’s very little
of that trade except on Saturday nights or Sunday
mornings. People wants a decent tile for Sundays
and don’t care for work-days. I never hawks
hats, but I sells to those as do. My customers for
hats are mechanics, with an odd clerk or two.
Yes, indeed, I sell hats now and then to my own
countrymen to go decent to mass in. I go to
mass myself as often as I can; sometimes I go to
vespers. No, the Irish in this trade ain’t so good
in going to chapel as they ought, but it takes such
a time; not just while you’re there, but in shaving,
and washing, and getting ready. My wife helps
me in selling second-hand things; she’s a better
hand than I am. I have two boys; they’re
young yet, and I don’t know what we shall bring
them up to; perhaps to our own business; and
children seems to fall naturally into it, I think,
when their fathers and mothers is in it. They’re
at school now.</p>

<p>“I have sold hats from 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but very
seldom 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> ones would wear out
two new gossamers, I know. It’s seldom you
see beaver hats in the street-trade now, they’re
nearly all silk. They say the beavers have got
scarce in foreign parts where they’re caught. I
haven’t an idea how many hats I sell in a year,
for I don’t stick to hats, you see, sir, but I like
doing in them as well or better than in anything
else. Sometimes I’ve sold nothing but hats for
weeks together, wholesale and retail that is. It’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
only the regular-shaped hats I can sell. If you
offer swells’ hats, people’ll say: ‘I may as well
buy a new “wide-awake” at once.’ I have made
20<i>s.</i> in a week on hats alone. But if I confined
my trade to them now, I don’t suppose I could
clear 5<i>s.</i> one week with another the year through.
It’s only the hawkers that can sell them in wet
weather. I wish we could sell under cover in all
the places where there’s what you call ‘street-markets.’
It would save poor people that lives
by the street many a twopence by their things
not being spoiled, and by people not heeding the
rain to go and examine them.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Women’s Second-hand
Apparel.</span></h3>

<p>This trade, as regards the sale to retail customers
in the streets, is almost entirely in the
hands of women, seven-eighths of whom are the
wives, relatives, or connections of the men who
deal in second-hand male apparel. But gowns,
cloaks, bonnets, &amp;c., are collected more largely by
men than by women, and the wholesale old
clothes’ merchants of course deal in every sort of
habiliment. Petticoat and Rosemary-lanes are the
grand marts for this street-sale, but in Whitecross-street,
Leather-lane, Old-street (St. Luke’s), and
some similar Saturday-night markets in poor
neighbourhoods, women’s second-hand apparel is
sometimes offered. “It is often of little use offering
it in the latter places,” I was told by a lace-seller
who had sometimes tried to do business in
second-hand shawls and cloaks, “because you are
sure to hear, ‘Oh, we can get them far cheaper in
Petticoat-lane, when we like to go as far.’”</p>

<p>The different portions of female dress are shown
and sold in the street, as I have described in my
account of Rosemary-lane, and of the trading of
the men selling second-hand male apparel. There
is not so much attention paid to “set off” gowns
that there is to set off coats. “If the gown be a
washing gown,” I was informed, “it is sure to
have to be washed before it can be worn, and so
it is no use bothering with it, and paying for
soap and labour beforehand. If it be woollen, or
some stuff that wont wash, it has almost always
to be altered before it is worn, and so it is no
use doing it up perhaps to be altered again.”
Silk goods, however, are carefully enough re-glossed
and repaired. Most of the others “just
take their chance.”</p>

<p>A good-looking Irishwoman gave me the following
account. She had come to London and had
been a few years in service, where she saved a little
money, when she married a cousin, but in what
degree of cousinship she did not know. She
then took part in his avocation as a crockman,
and subsequently as a street-seller of second-hand
clothes.</p>

<p>“Why, yis, thin and indeed, sir,” she said, “I
did feel rather quare in my new trade, going about
from house to house, the Commercial-road and
Stepney way, but I soon got not to mind, and
indeed thin it don’t matter much what way one
gets one’s living, so long as it’s honest. O, yis,
I know there’s goings on in old clothes that isn’t
always honest, but my husband’s a fair dealing
man. I felt quarer, too, whin I had to sell in the
strate, but I soon got used to that, too; and it’s
not such slavish work as the ‘crocks.’ But we
sometimes ‘crocks’ in the mornings a little still,
and sells in the evenings. No, not what we’ve
collected&mdash;for that goes to Mr. Isaac’s market
almost always&mdash;but stock that’s ready for wear.</p>

<p>“For <i>Cotton Gowns</i> I’ve got from 9<i>d.</i> to
2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> O, yis, and indeed thin, there’s gowns
chaper, 4<i>d.</i> and 6<i>d.</i>, but there’s nothing to be got
out of them, and we don’t sell them. From 9<i>d.</i>
to 18<i>d.</i> is the commonest price. It’s poor people
as buys: O, yis, and indeed thin it is, thim as
has families, and must look about thim. Many’s
the poor woman that’s said to me, ‘Well, and
indeed, marm, it isn’t my inclination to chapen
anybody as I thinks is fair, and I was brought up
quite different to buying old gowns, I assure you’&mdash;yis,
that’s often said; no, sir, it isn’t my countrywomen
that says it (laughing), it’s yours. ‘I
wouldn’t think,’ says she, ‘of offering you 1<i>d.</i> less
than 1<i>s.</i>, marm, for that frock for my daughter,
marm, but it’s such a hard fight to live.’ Och,
thin, and it is indeed; but to hear some of them
talk you’d think they was born ladies. <i>Stuff-gowns</i>
is from 2<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> higher than cotton, but
they don’t sell near so well. I hardly know why.
Cotton washes, and if a dacent woman gets a
chape second-hand cotton, she washes and does it
up, and it seems to come to her fresh and new.
That can’t be done with stuff. <i>Silk</i> is very little
in my way, but silk gowns sell from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>
Of satin and velvet gowns I can tell you nothing;
they’re never in the streets.</p>

<p>“<i>Second-hand Bonnets</i> is a very poor sale&mdash;very.
The milliners, poor craitchers, as makes
them up and sells them in the strate, has the
greatest sale, but they makes very little by it.
Their bonnets looks new, you see, sir, and close
and nice for poor women. I’ve sold bonnets from
6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and some of them cost 3<i>l.</i> But
whin they git faded and out of fashion, they’re
of no vally at all at all. <i>Shawls</i> is a very little
sale; very little. I’ve got from 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for them. Plaid shawls is as good as any, at
about 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but they’re a winter trade. <i>Cloaks</i>
(they are what in the dress-making trade are called
mantles) isn’t much of a call. I’ve had them
from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> as high as 7<i>s.</i>&mdash;but only once
7<i>s.</i>, and it was good silk. They’re not a sort
of wear that suits poor people. Will and
indeed thin, I hardly know who buys them
second-hand. Perhaps bad women buys a few,
or they get men to buy them for them. I think
your misses don’t buy much second-hand thin in
gineral; the less the better, the likes of them;
yis, indeed, sir. <i>Stays</i> I don’t sell, but you can
buy them from 3<i>d.</i> to 15<i>d.</i>; it’s a small trade.
And I don’t sell <i>Under Clothing</i>, or only now and
thin, except <i>Children’s</i>. Dear me, I can hardly
tell the prices I get for the poor little things’
dress&mdash;I’ve a little girl myself&mdash;the prices vary
so, just as the frocks and other things is made for
big children or little, and what they’re made of.
I’ve sold frocks&mdash;they sell best on Saturday and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Monday nights&mdash;from 2<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Little petticoats
is 1<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i>; shifts is 1<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i>, and so
is little shirts. If they wasn’t so low there would
be more rags than there is, and sure there’s
plinty.</p>

<p>“Will, thin and indeed, I don’t know what we
make in a week, and if I did, why should I tell?
O, yes, sir, I know from the gentleman that sent
you to me that you’re asking for a good purpose:
yis, indeed, thin; but I ralely can’t say. We do
pritty well, God’s name be praised! Perhaps a
good second-hand gown trade and such like is
worth from 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a week, and nearer 15<i>s.</i>
than 10<i>s.</i> ivery week; but that’s a <i>good</i> second-hand
trade you understand, sir. A poor trade’s
about half that, perhaps. But thin my husband
sells men’s wear as well. Yis, indeed, and I find
time to go to mass, and I soon got my husband to
go after we was married, for he’d got to neglect it,
God be praised; and what’s all you can get here
compared to making your sowl” [saving your soul&mdash;<i>making</i>
your soul is not an uncommon phrase
among some of the Irish people]. “Och, and
indeed thin, sir, if you’ve met Father &mdash;&mdash;, you’ve
met a good gintleman.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the street-selling of <i>women and children’s
second-hand boots and shoes</i>, I need say but little,
as they form part of the stock of the men’s ware,
and are sold by the same men, not unfrequently
assisted by their wives. The best sale is for black
<i>cloth boots</i>, whether laced or buttoned, but the
prices run only from 5<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> If the “legs”
of a second-hand pair be good, they are worth 5<i>d.</i>,
no matter what the leather portion, including the
soles, may be. Coloured boots sell very indifferently.
Children’s boots and shoes are sold
from 2<i>d.</i> to 15<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Second-hand
Furs.</span></h3>

<p>Of furs the street-sale is prompt enough, or used
to be prompt; but not so much so, I am told,
last season, as formerly. A fur tippet is readily
bought for the sake of warmth by women who
thrive pretty well in the keeping of coffee-stalls,
or any calling which requires attendance during
the night, or in the chilliness of early morning,
even in summer, by those who go out at early
hours to their work. By such persons a big tippet
is readily bought when the money is not an
impediment, and to many it is a strong recommendation,
that when new, the tippet, most
likely, was worn by a real lady. So I was
assured by a person familiar with the trade.</p>

<p>One female street-seller had three stalls or
stands in the New Cut (when it was a great street
market), about two years back, and all for the
sale of second-hand furs. She has now a small
shop in second-hand wearing apparel (women’s)
generally, furs being of course included. The
business carried on in the street (almost always
“the Cut”) by the fur-seller in question, who was
both industrious and respectable, was very considerable.
On a Monday she has not unfrequently
taken 3<i>l.</i>, one-half of which, indeed more than
half, was profit, for the street-seller bought in the
summer, when furs “were no money at all,” and
sold in the winter, when they “were really tin,
and no mistake.” Before the season began, she
sometimes had a small room nearly full of furs.</p>

<p>This trade is less confined to Petticoat-lane and
the old clothes district, as regards the supply to
retail customers, than is anything else connected
with dress. But the fur trade is now small. The
money, prudence, and forethought necessary to
enable a fur-seller to buy in the summer, for
ample profit in the winter, as regards street-trade,
is not in accordance with the habits of the general
run of street-sellers, who think but of the present,
or hardly think even of that.</p>

<p>The old furs, like all the other old articles of
wearing apparel, whether garbs of what may be
accounted primary necessaries, as shoes, or mere
comforts or adornments, as boas or muffs, are
bought in the first instance at the Old Clothes
Exchange, and so find their way to the street-sellers.
The exceptions as to this first transaction
in the trade I now speak of, are very trifling, and,
perhaps, more trifling than in other articles, for
one great supply of furs, I am informed, is from
their being swopped in the spring and summer for
flowers with the “root-sellers,” who carry them to
the Exchange.</p>

<p>Last winter there were sometimes as many as
ten persons&mdash;three-fourths of the number of second-hand
fur sellers, which fluctuates, being women&mdash;with
fur-stands. They frequent the street-markets
on the Saturday and Monday nights, not confining
themselves to any one market in particular. The
best sale is for <i>Fur Tippets</i>, and chiefly of the
darker colours. These are bought, one of the
dealers informed me, frequently by maid-servants,
who could run of errands in them in the dark, or
wear them in wet weather. They are sold from
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, about 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> being a
common charge. Children’s tippets “go off well,”
from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> <i>Boas</i> are not vended to half
the extent of tippets, although they are lower-priced,
one of tolerably good gray squirrel being
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The reason of the difference in the demand
is that boas are as much an ornament as a garment,
while the tippet answers the purpose of a shawl.
<i>Muffs</i> are not at all vendible in the streets, the
few that are disposed of being principally for children.
As muffs are not generally used by maid-servants,
or by the families of the working classes,
the absence of demand in the second-hand traffic
is easily accounted for. They are bought sometimes
to cut up for other purposes. <i>Victorines</i>
are disposed of readily enough at from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
as are <i>Cuffs</i>, from 4<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>One man, who told me that a few years since he
and his wife used to sell second-hand furs in the
street, was of opinion that his best customers were
women of the town, who were tolerably well-dressed,
and who required some further protection
from the night air. He could readily sell any
“tidy” article, tippet, boa, or muff, to those females,
if they had from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> at command. He
had so sold them in Clare-market, in Tottenham-court-road,
and the Brill.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Second-Hand Sellers of Smithfield-market.</span></h3>

<p>No small part of the second-hand trade of London
is carried on in the market-place of Smithfield,
on the Friday afternoons. Here is a mart for
almost everything which is required for the harnessing
of beasts of draught, or is required for
any means of propulsion or locomotion, either as a
whole vehicle, or in its several parts, needed by
street-traders: also of the machines, vessels, scales,
weights, measures, baskets, stands, and all other
appliances of street-trade.</p>

<p>The scene is animated and peculiar. Apart
from the horse, ass, and goat trade (of which I
shall give an account hereafter), it is a grand
Second-hand Costermongers’ Exchange. The
trade is not confined to that large body, though
they are the principal merchants, but includes
greengrocers (often the costermonger in a shop),
carmen, and others. It is, moreover, a favourite
resort of the purveyors of street-provisions and
beverages, of street dainties and luxuries. Of
this class some of the most prosperous are those
who are “well known in Smithfield.”</p>

<p>The space devoted to this second-hand commerce
and its accompaniments, runs from St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital towards Long-lane, but
isolated peripatetic traders are found in all parts
of the space not devoted to the exhibition of cattle
or of horses. The crowd on the day of my visit
was considerable, but from several I heard the
not-always-very-veracious remarks of “Nothing
doing” and “There’s nobody at all here to-day.”
The weather was sultry, and at every few yards
arose the cry from men and boys, “Ginger-beer,
ha’penny a glass! Ha’penny a glass,” or “Iced
lemonade here! Iced raspberriade, as cold as ice,
ha’penny a glass, only a ha’penny!” A boy was
elevated on a board at the end of a splendid affair
of this kind. It was a square built vehicle, the
top being about 7 feet by 4, and flat and surmounted
by the lemonade fountain; long, narrow,
champagne glasses, holding a raspberry coloured
liquid, frothed up exceedingly, were ranged round,
and the beverage dispensed by a woman, the
mother or employer of the boy who was bawling.
The sides of the machine, which stood on wheels,
were a bright, shiny blue, and on them sprawled
the lion and unicorn in gorgeous heraldry, yellow
and gold, the artist being, according to a prominent
announcement, a “herald painter.” The
apparatus was handsome, but with that exaggeration
of handsomeness which attracts the high and
low vulgar, who cannot distinguish between gaudiness
and beauty. The sale was brisk. The
ginger-beer sold in the market was generally dispensed
from carts, and here I noticed, what
occurs yearly in street-commerce, an innovation on
the established system of the trade. Several
sellers disposed of their ginger-beer in clear glass
bottles, somewhat larger and fuller-necked than
those introduced by M. Soyer for the sale of his
“nectar,” and the liquid was drank out of the
bottle the moment the cork was undrawn, and so
the necessity of a glass was obviated.</p>

<p>Near the herald-painter’s work, of which I
have just spoken, stood a very humble stall on
which were loaves of bread, and round the loaves
were pieces of fried fish and slices of bread on
plates, all remarkably clean. “Oysters! Penny-a
lot! Penny-a-lot, oysters!” was the cry, the
most frequently heard after that of ginger-beer,
&amp;c. “Cherries! Twopence a-pound! Penny-a
pound, cherries!” “Fruit-pies! Try my fruit-pies!”
The most famous dealer in all kinds of
penny pies is, however, not a pedestrian, but an
equestrian hawker. He drives a very smart,
handsome pie-cart, sitting behind after the manner
of the Hansom cabmen, the lifting up of a lid
below his knees displaying his large stock of pies.
His “drag” is whisked along rapidly by a brisk
chestnut poney, well-harnessed. The “whole set
out,” I was informed, poney included, cost 50<i>l.</i>
when new. The proprietor is a keen Chartist and
teetotaller, and loses no opportunity to inculcate
to his customers the excellence of teetotalism, as
well as of his pies. “Milk! ha’penny a pint!
ha’penny a pint, good milk!” is another cry.
“Raspberry cream! Iced raspberry-cream, ha’penny
a glass!” This street-seller had a capital trade.
Street-ices, or rather ice-creams, were somewhat of
a failure last year, more especially in Greenwich-park,
but this year they seem likely to succeed.
The Smithfield man sold them in very small
glasses, which he merely dipped into a vessel at
his feet, and so filled them with the cream. The
consumers had to use their fingers instead of a
spoon, and no few seemed puzzled how to eat their
ice, and were grievously troubled by its getting
among their teeth. I heard one drover mutter
that he felt “as if it had snowed in his belly!”
Perhaps at Smithfield-market on the Friday afternoons
every street-trade in eatables and drinkables
has its representative, with the exception of such
things as sweet-stuff, curds and whey, &amp;c., which
are bought chiefly by women and children. There
were plum-dough, plum-cake, pastry, pea-soup,
whelks, periwinkles, ham-sandwiches, hot-eels,
oranges, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>These things are the usual accompaniment of
street-markets, and I now come to the subject
matter of the work, the sale of second-hand
articles.</p>

<p>In this trade, since the introduction of a new
arrangement two months ago, there has been a
great change. The vendors are not allowed to
vend barrows in the market, unless indeed with a
poney or donkey harnessed to them, or unless
they are wheeled about by the owner, and they
are not allowed to spread their wares on the
ground. When it is considered of what those
wares are composed, the awkwardness of the
arrangement, to the sales-people, may be understood.
They consist of second-hand collars, pads,
saddles, bridles, bits, traces, every description of
worn harness, whole or in parts; the wheels,
springs, axles, &amp;c., of barrows and carts; the
beams, chains, and bodies of scales;&mdash;these, perhaps,
are the chief things which are sold separately,
as parts of a whole. The traders have now
no other option but to carry them as they best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
can, and offer them for sale. You saw men who
really appear clad in harness. Portions were
fastened round their bodies, collars slung on their
arms, pads or small cart-saddles, with their shaft-gear,
were planted on their shoulders. Some
carried merely a collar, or a harness bridle,
or even a bit or a pair of spurs. It was the
same with the springs, &amp;c., of the barrows
and small carts. They were carried under
men’s arms, or poised on their shoulders. The
wheels and other things which are too heavy
for such modes of transport had to be placed in
some sort of vehicle, and in the vehicles might be
seen trestles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The complaints on the part of the second-hand
sellers were neither few nor mild: “If it had
been a fat ox that had to be accommodated,” said
one, “before he was roasted for an alderman,
they’d have found some way to do it. But it
don’t matter for poor men; though why we
shouldn’t be suited with a market as well as
richer people is not the ticket, that’s the fact.”</p>

<p>These arrangements are already beginning to be
infringed, and will be more and more infringed,
for such is always the case. The reason why they
were adopted was that the ground was so littered,
that there was not room for the donkey traffic and
other requirements of the market. The donkeys,
when “shown,” under the old arrangement, often
trod on boards of old metal, &amp;c., spread on the
ground, and tripped, sometimes to their injury, in
consequence. Prior to the change, about twenty
persons used to come from Petticoat-lane, &amp;c., and
spread their old metal or other stores on the
ground.</p>

<p>Of these there are now none. These Petticoat-laners,
I was told by a Smithfield frequenter,
were men “who knew the price of old rags,”&mdash;a
new phrase expressive of their knowingness and
keenness in trade.</p>

<p>The statistics of this trade will be found under
that head; the prices are often much higher and
much lower. I speak of the regular trades. I
have not included the sale of the superior butchers’
carts, &amp;c., as that is a traffic not in the hands of
the regular second-hand street-sellers. I have not
thought it requisite to speak of the hawking
of whips, sticks, wash-leathers, brushes, curry-combs,
&amp;c., &amp;c., of which I have already treated
distinctively.</p>

<p>The accounts of the Capital and Income of the
Street-Sellers of Second-Hand Articles I am
obliged to defer till a future occasion.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_LIVE_ANIMALS"></a>OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF LIVE ANIMALS.</h2>

</div>

<p>The live animals sold in the streets include beasts,
birds, fish, and reptiles, all sold in the streets of
London.</p>

<p>The class of men carrying on this business&mdash;for
they are nearly all men&mdash;is mixed; but the majority
are of a half-sporting and half-vagrant kind.
One informant told me that the bird-catchers, for
instance, when young, as more than three-fourths
of them are, were those who “liked to be after a
loose end,” first catching their birds, as a sort of
sporting business, and then sometimes selling them
in the streets, but far more frequently disposing of
them in the bird-shops. “Some of these boys,”
a bird-seller in a large way of business said to me,
“used to become rat-catchers or dog-sellers, but
there’s not such great openings in the rat and dog
line now. As far as I know, they’re the same
lads, or just the same sort of lads, anyhow, as you
may see ‘helping,’ holding horses, or things like
that, at concerns like them small races at Peckham
or Chalk Farm, or helping any way at the
foot-races at Camberwell.” There is in this bird-catching
a strong manifestation of the vagrant
spirit. To rise long before daybreak; to walk
some miles before daybreak; from the earliest
dawn to wait in some field, or common, or wood,
watching the capture of the birds; then a long
trudge to town to dispose of the fluttering captives;
all this is done cheerfully, because there are
about it the irresistible charms, to this class, of
excitement, variety, and free and open-air life.
Nor do these charms appear one whit weakened
when, as happens often enough, all this early morn
business is carried on fasting.</p>

<p>The old men in the bird-catching business are
not to be ranked as to their enjoyment of it with
the juveniles, for these old men are sometimes
infirm, and can but, as one of them said to me
some time ago, “hobble about it.” But they have
the same spirit, or the sparks of it. And in this
part of the trade is one of the curious characteristics
of a street-life, or rather of an open-air
pursuit for the requirements of a street-trade. A
man, worn out for other purposes, incapable of
anything but a passive, or sort of lazy labour&mdash;such
as lying in a field and watching the action of
his trap-cages&mdash;will yet in a summer’s morning,
decrepid as he may be, possess himself of a dozen
or even a score of the very freest and most aspiring
of all our English small birds, a creature of the
air beyond other birds of his “order”&mdash;to use an
ornithological term&mdash;of sky-larks.</p>

<p>The dog-sellers are of a sporting, trading,
idling class. Their sport is now the rat-hunt, or
the ferret-match, or the dog-fight; as it was with
the predecessors of their stamp, the cock-fight;
the bull, bear, and badger bait; the shrove-tide
cock-shy, or the duck hunt. Their trading spirit
is akin to that of the higher-class sporting fraternity,
the trading members of the turf. They love
to sell and to bargain, always with a quiet exultation
at the time&mdash;a matter of loud tavern boast
afterwards, perhaps, as respects the street-folk&mdash;how
they “do” a customer, or “do” one another.
“It’s not cheating,” was the remark and apology
of a very famous jockey of the old times, touching
such measures; “it’s not cheating, it’s outwitting.”
Perhaps this expresses the code of honesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of such traders; not to cheat, but to outwit or
over-reach. Mixed with such traders, however,
are found a few quiet, plodding, fair-dealing men,
whom it is difficult to classify, otherwise than that
they are “in the line, just because they likes it.”
The idling of these street-sellers is a part of their
business. To walk by the hour up and down a
street, and with no manual labour except to clean
their dogs’ kennels, and to carry them in their
arms, is but an idleness, although, as some of these
men will tell you, “they work hard at it.”</p>

<p>Under the respective heads of dog and bird-sellers,
I shall give more detailed characteristics of
the class, as well as of the varying qualities and
inducements of the buyers.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of foreign birds, such as parrots,
parroquets, and cockatoos; of gold and silver
fish; of goats, tortoises, rabbits, leverets, hedgehogs;
and the collectors of snails, worms, frogs,
and toads, are also a mixed body. Foreigners,
Jews, seamen, countrymen, costermongers, and
boys form a part, and of them I shall give a description
under the several heads. The prominently-characterized
street-sellers are the traders
in dogs and birds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the former Street-Sellers, “Finders,”
Stealers, and Restorers of Dogs.</span></h3>

<p>Before I describe the present condition of the
street-trade in dogs, which is principally in
spaniels, or in the description well known as lap-dogs,
I will give an account of the former condition
of the trade, if trade it can properly be
called, for the “finders” and “stealers” of dogs
were the more especial subjects of a parliamentary
inquiry, from which I derive the official
information on the matter. The Report of the
Committee was ordered by the House of Commons
to be printed, July 26, 1844.</p>

<p>In their Report the Committee observe, concerning
the value of pet dogs:&mdash;“From the evidence
of various witnesses it appears, that in one
case a spaniel was sold for 105<i>l.</i>, and in another,
under a sheriff’s execution, for 95<i>l.</i> at the hammer;
and 50<i>l.</i> or 60<i>l.</i> are not unfrequently given for
fancy dogs of first-rate breed and beauty.” The
hundred guineas’ dog above alluded to was a
“black and tan King Charles’s spaniel;”&mdash;indeed,
Mr. Dowling, the editor of <i>Bell’s Life in London</i>,
said, in his evidence before the Committee, “I
have known as much as 150<i>l.</i> given for a dog.”
He said afterwards: “There are certain marks
about the eyes and otherwise, which are considered
‘properties;’ and it depends entirely upon
the property which a dog possesses as to its
value.”</p>

<p>I need not dwell on the general fondness of the
English for dogs, otherwise than as regards what
were the grand objects of the dog-finders’ search&mdash;ladies’
small spaniels and lap-dogs, or, as they
are sometimes called, “carriage-dogs,” by their
being the companions of ladies inside their carriages.
These animals first became fashionable
by the fondness of Charles II. for them. That
monarch allowed them undisturbed possession of
the gilded chairs in his palace of Whitehall, and
seldom took his accustomed walk in the park without
a tribe of them at his heels. So “fashionable”
were spaniels at that time and afterwards, that in
1712 Pope made the chief of all his sylphs and
sylphides the guard of a lady’s lapdog. The
fashion has long continued, and still continues;
and it was on this fashionable fondness for a toy,
and on the regard of many others for the noble
and affectionate qualities of the dog, that a traffic
was established in London, which became so extensive
and so lucrative, that the legislature interfered,
in 1844, for the purpose of checking it.</p>

<p>I cannot better show the extent and lucrativeness
of this trade, than by citing a list which
one of the witnesses before Parliament, Mr. W.
Bishop, a gunmaker, delivered in to the Committee,
of “cases in which money had recently
been extorted from the owners of dogs by dog-stealers
and their confederates.” There is no explanation
of the space of time included under the
vague term “recently;” but the return shows that
151 ladies and gentlemen had been the victims of
the dog-stealers or dog-finders, for in this business
the words were, and still are to a degree, synonymes,
and of these 62 had been so victimized
in 1843 and in the six months of 1844, from
January to July. The total amount shown
by Mr. Bishop to have been paid for the
restoration of stolen dogs was 977<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or an
average of 6<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per individual practised upon.
This large sum, it is stated on the authority of
the Committee, was only that which came within
Mr. Bishop’s knowledge, and formed, perhaps,
“but a <i>tenth</i> part in amount” of the whole extortion.
Mr. Bishop was himself in the habit of
doing business “in obtaining the restitution of
dogs,” and had once known 18<i>l.</i>&mdash;the dog-stealers
asked 25<i>l.</i>&mdash;given for the restitution of a spaniel.
The full amount realized by this dog-stealing was,
according to the above proportion, 9772<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> In
1843, 227<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was so realized, and
97<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the six months of 1844, within
Mr. Bishop’s personal knowledge; and if this be
likewise a <i>tenth</i> of the whole of the commerce
in this line, a year’s business, it appears, averaged
2166<i>l.</i> to the stealers or finders of dogs. I select
a few names from the list of those robbed of dogs,
either from the amount paid, or because the names
are well known. The first payment cited is from
a public board, who owned a dog in their corporate
capacity:</p>

<p>Thus these 36 ladies and gentlemen paid
438<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to rescue their dogs from professional
dog-stealers, or an average, per individual, of upwards
of 12<i>l.</i></p>

<p>These dog appropriators, as they found that
they could levy contributions not only on royalty,
foreign ambassadors, peers, courtiers, and ladies of
rank, but on public bodies, and on the dignitaries
of the state, the law, the army, and the church,
became bolder and more expert in their avocations&mdash;a
boldness which was encouraged by the existing
law. Prior to the parliamentary inquiry, dog-stealing
was not an indictable offence. To show
this, Mr. Commissioner Mayne quoted Blackstone
to the Committee: “As to those animals which
do not serve for food, and which therefore the law
holds to have no intrinsic value, as dogs of all
sorts, and other creatures kept for whim and pleasure&mdash;though
a man may have a base property
therein, and maintain a civil action for the loss of
them, yet they are not of such estimation as that
the crime of stealing them amounts to larceny.”
The only mode of punishment for dog-stealing was
by summary conviction, the penalty being fine or
imprisonment; but Mr. Commissioner Mayne did
not know of any instance of a dog-stealer being
sent to prison in default of payment. Although the
law recognised no property in a dog, the animal
was taxed; and it was complained at the time
that an unhappy lady might have to pay tax for
the full term upon her dog, perhaps a year and a
half after he had been stolen from her. One old
offender, who stole the Duke of Beaufort’s dog, was
transported, not for stealing the dog, but his collar.</p>

<p>The difficulty of proving the positive theft of a
dog was extreme. In most cases, where the man
was not seen actually to seize a dog which could
be identified, he escaped when carried before a
magistrate. “The dog-stealers,” said Inspector
Shackell, “generally go two together; they have
a piece of liver; they say it is merely bullock’s
liver, which will entice or tame the wildest or
savagest dog which there can be in any yard;
they give it him, and take him from his chain.
At other times,” continues Mr. Shackell, “they
will go in the street with a little dog, rubbed over
with some sort of stuff, and will entice valuable
dogs away.... If there is a dog lost or
stolen, it is generally known within five or six
hours where that dog is, and they know almost
exactly what they can get for it, so that it is a
regular system of plunder.” Mr. G. White,
“dealer in live stock, dogs, and other animals,”
and at one time a “dealer in lions, and tigers, and
all sorts of things,” said of the dog-stealers: “In
turning the corners of streets there are two or
three of them together; one will snatch up a dog
and put into his apron, and the others will stop
the lady and say, ‘What is the matter?’ and direct
the party who has lost the dog in a contrary
direction to that taken.”</p>

<p>In this business were engaged from 50 to
60 men, half of them actual stealers of the
animals. The others were the receivers, and the
go-betweens or “restorers.” The thief kept
the dog perhaps for a day or two at some public-house,
and he then took it to a dog-dealer with
whom he was connected in the way of business.
These dealers carried on a trade in “honest
dogs,” as one of the witnesses styled them (meaning
dogs honestly acquired), but some of them
dealt principally with the dog-stealers. Their
depots could not be entered by the police, being
private premises, without a search-warrant&mdash;and
direct evidence was necessary to obtain a search-warrant&mdash;and
of course a stranger in quest of a
stolen dog would not be admitted. Some of the
dog-dealers would not purchase or receive dogs
known to have been stolen, but others bought
and speculated in them. If an advertisement
appeared offering a reward for the dog, a negotiation
was entered into. If no reward was offered,
the owner of the dog, who was always either
known or made out, was waited upon by a restorer,
who undertook “to restore the dog if terms
could be come to.” A dog belonging to Colonel
Fox was once kept six weeks before the thieves
would consent to the Colonel’s terms. One of the
most successful restorers was a shoemaker, and
mixed little with the actual stealers; the dog-dealers,
however, acted as restorers frequently
enough. If the person robbed paid a good round
sum for the restoration of a dog, and paid it
speedily, the animal was almost certain to be
stolen a second time, and a higher sum was then
demanded. Sometimes the thieves threatened
that if they were any longer trifled with they
would inflict torture on the dog, or cut its throat.
One lady, Miss Brown of Bolton-street, was so
worried by these threats, and by having twice to
redeem her dog, “that she has left England,”
said Mr. Bishop, “and I really do believe for the
sake of keeping the dog.” It does not appear, as
far as the evidence shows, that these threats of
torture or death were ever carried into execution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
some of the witnesses had merely heard of such
things.</p>

<p>The shoemaker alluded to was named Taylor,
and Inspector Shackell thus describes this person’s
way of transacting business in the dog “restoring”
line: “There is a man named Taylor, who is one
of the greatest restorers in London of stolen dogs,
through Mr. Bishop.” [Mr. Bishop was a gunmaker
in Bond-street.] “It is a disgrace to
London that any person should encourage a man
like that to go to extort money from ladies and
gentlemen, especially a respectable man. A gentleman
applied to me to get a valuable dog that
was stolen, with a chain on his neck, and the
name on the collar; and I heard Mr. Bishop himself
say that it cost 6<i>l.</i>; that it could not be got
for less. Capt. Vansittart (the owner of the dog)
came out; I asked him particularly, ‘Will you
give me a description of the dog on a piece of
paper,’ and that is his writing (producing a paper).
I went and made inquiry; and the captain himself,
who lives in Belgrave-square, said he had no
objection to give 4<i>l.</i> for the recovery of the dog,
but would not give the 6<i>l.</i> I went and took a
good deal of trouble about it. I found out that
Taylor went first to ascertain what the owner of
the dog would give for it, and then went and
offered 1<i>l.</i> for the dog, then 2<i>l.</i>, and at last purchased
it for 3<i>l.</i>; and went and told Capt. Vansittart
that he had given 4<i>l.</i> for the dog; and the
dog went back through the hands of Mr. Bishop.”</p>

<p>The “restorers” had, it appears, the lion’s share
in the profits of this business. One witness had
known of as much as ten guineas being given for
the recovery of a favourite spaniel, or, as the witness
styled it, for “working a dog back,” and
only two of these guineas being received by “the
party.” The wronged individual, thus delicately
intimated as the “party,” was the thief. The
same witness, Mr. Hobdell, knew 14<i>l.</i> given for
the restoration of a little red Scotch terrier, which
he, as a dog-dealer, valued at four shillings!</p>

<p>One of the coolest instances of the organization
and boldness of the dog-stealers was in the case
of Mr. Fitzroy Kelly’s “favourite Scotch terrier.”
The “parties,” possessing it through theft, asked
12<i>l.</i> for it, and urged that it was a reasonable
offer, considering the trouble they were obliged to
take. “The dog-stealers were obliged to watch
every night,” they contended, through Mr. Bishop,
“and very diligently; Mr. Kelly kept them out
very late from their homes, before they could get
the dog; he used to go out to dinner or down to
the Temple, and take the dog with him; they had
a deal of trouble before they could get it.” So Mr.
Kelly was expected not only to pay more than the
value of his dog, but an extra amount on account
of the care he had taken of his terrier, and for the
trouble his vigilance had given to the thieves!
The matter was settled at 6<i>l.</i> Mr. Kelly’s case
was but one instance.</p>

<p>Among the most successful of the practitioners
in this street-finding business were Messrs.
“Ginger” and “Carrots,” but a parliamentary
witness was inclined to believe that Ginger and
Carrots were nicknames for the same individual,
one Barrett; although he had been in custody
several times, he was considered “a very superior
dog-stealer.”</p>

<p>If the stolen dog were of little value, it was
safest for the stealers to turn him loose; if he
were of value, and unowned and unsought for, there
was a ready market abroad. The stewards,
stokers, or seamen of the Ostend, Antwerp, Rotterdam,
Hamburgh, and all the French steamers,
readily bought stolen fancy dogs; sometimes twenty
to thirty were taken at a voyage. A steward,
indeed, has given 12<i>l.</i> for a stolen spaniel as a
private speculation. Dealers, too, came occasionally
from Paris, and bought numbers of these
animals, and at what the dog foragers considered
fair prices. One of the witnesses (Mr. Baker, a
game dealer in Leadenhall-market) said:&mdash;“I
have seen perhaps twenty or thirty dogs tied up in
a little room, and I should suppose every one of
them was stolen; a reward not sufficiently high
being offered for their restoration, the parties get
more money by taking them on board the different
steam-ships and selling them to persons on board,
or to people coming to this country to buy dogs
and take them abroad.”</p>

<p>The following statement, derived from Mr.
Mayne’s evidence, shows the extent of the dog-stealing
business, but only as far as came under
the cognizance of the police. It shows the
number of dogs “lost” or “stolen,” and of persons
“charged” with the offence, and “convicted”
or “discharged.” Nearly all the dogs returned as
lost, I may observe, were stolen, but there was no
evidence to show the positive t<span class="lock">heft:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In what proportion the police-known thefts
stood to the whole number, there was no evidence
given; nor, I suppose, could it be given.</p>

<p>The dog-stealers were not considered to be connected
with housebreakers, though they might
frequent the same public-houses. Mr. Mayne
pronounced these dog-stealers a genus, a peculiar
class, “what they call dog-fanciers and dog-stealers;
a sort of half-sporting, betting characters.”</p>

<p>The law on the subject of dog-stealing (8 and 9
Vict., c. 47) now is, that “If any person shall
steal any dog, every such offender shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and, being convicted
thereof before any two or more justices of the
peace, shall, for the first offence, at the discretion
of the said justices, either be committed to the
common gaol or house of correction, there to be
imprisoned only, or be imprisoned and kept to hard
labour, for any term not exceeding six calendar
months, or shall forfeit and pay over and above
the value of the said dog such sum of money, not
exceeding 20<i>l.</i>, as to the said justices shall seem
meet. And if any person so convicted shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
afterwards be guilty of the same offence, every
such offender shall be guilty of an indictable misdemeanor,
and, being convicted thereof, shall be
liable to suffer such punishment, by fine or imprisonment,
with or without hard labour, or by
both, as the court in its discretion shall award,
provided such imprisonment do not exceed eighteen
months.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Dog-“Finder”.&mdash;A “Lurker’s”
Career.</span></h3>

<p>Concerning a dog-finder, I received the following
account from one who had received the education
of a gentleman, but whom circumstances had
driven to an association with the vagrant class,
and who has written the dog-finder’s biography
from personal knowledge&mdash;a biography which shows
the <i>variety</i> that often characterizes the career of
the “lurker,” or street-adventurer.</p>

<p>“If your readers,” writes my informant, “have
passed the Rubicon of ‘forty years in the wilderness,’
memory must bring back the time when
the feet of their childish pilgrimage have trodden
a beautiful grass-plot&mdash;now converted into Belgrave-square;
when Pimlico was a ‘village out of
town,’ and the ‘five fields’ of Chelsea were fields
indeed. To write the biography of a living character
is always delicate, as to embrace all its particulars
is difficult; but of the truthfulness of my
account there is no question.</p>

<p>“Probably about the year of the great frost
(1814), a French Protestant refugee, named La
Roche, sought asylum in this country, not from
persecution, but from difficulties of a commercial
character. He built for himself, in Chelsea, a
cottage of wood, nondescript in shape, but pleasant
in locality, and with ample accommodations for
himself and his son. Wife he had none. This
little bazaar of mud and sticks was surrounded
with a bench of rude construction, on which the
Sunday visitors to Ranelagh used to sit and sip
their curds and whey, while from the entrance&mdash;far
removed in those days from <span class="lock">competition&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">‘There stood uprear’d, as ensign of the place,</div>
      <div class="verse">Of blue and red and white, a checquer’d mace,</div>
      <div class="verse">On which the paper lantern hung to tell</div>
      <div class="verse">How cheap its owner shaved you, and how well.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Things went on smoothly for a dozen years, when
the old Frenchman departed this life.</p>

<p>“His boy carried on the business for a few
months, when frequent complaints of ‘Sunday
gambling’ on the premises, and loud whispers of
suspicion relative to the concealment of stolen
goods, induced ‘Chelsea George’&mdash;the name the
youth had acquired&mdash;to sell the good-will of the
house, fixtures, and all, and at the eastern extremity
of London to embark in business as a
‘mush or mushroom-faker.’ Independently of
his appropriation of umbrellas, proper to the mush-faker’s
calling, Chelsea George was by no means
scrupulous concerning other little matters within
his reach, and if the proprietors of the ‘swell
cribs’ within his ‘beat’ had no ‘umbrellas to mend,’
or ‘old ’uns to sell,’ he would ease the pegs in the
passage of the incumbrance of a greatcoat, and
telegraph the same out of sight (by a colleague),
while the servant went in to make the desired
inquiries. At last he was ‘bowl’d out’ in the
very act of ‘nailing a yack’ (stealing a watch).
He ‘expiated,’ as it is called, this offence by three
months’ exercise on the ‘cockchafer’ (tread-mill).
Unaccustomed as yet to the novelty of the exercise,
he fell through the wheel and broke one of
his legs. He was, of course, permitted to finish
his time in the infirmary of the prison, and on his
liberation was presented with five pounds out of
‘the Sheriffs’ Fund.’</p>

<p>“Although, as I have before stated, he had
never been out of England since his childhood,
he had some little hereditary knowledge of the
French language, and by the kind and voluntary
recommendation of one of the police-magistrates of
the metropolis, he was engaged by an Irish gentleman
proceeding to the Continent as a sort of
supernumerary servant, to ‘make himself generally
useful.’ As the gentleman was unmarried, and
mostly stayed at hotels, George was to have permanent
wages and ‘find himself,’ a condition he
invariably fulfilled, if anything was left in his
way. Frequent intemperance, neglect of duty,
and unaccountable departures of property from the
portmanteau of his master, led to his dismissal,
and Chelsea George was left, without friends or
character, to those resources which have supported
him for some thirty years.</p>

<p>“During his ‘umbrella’ enterprise he had lived
in lodging-houses of the lowest kind, and of course
mingled with the most depraved society, especially
with the vast army of trading sturdy mendicants,
male and female, young and old, who
assume every guise of poverty, misfortune, and
disease, which craft and ingenuity can devise or
well-tutored hypocrisy can imitate. Thus initiated,
Chelsea George could ‘go upon any lurk,’
could be in the last stage of consumption&mdash;actually
in his dying hour&mdash;but now and then convalescent
for years and years together. He could take fits
and counterfeit blindness, be a respectable broken-down
tradesman, or a soldier maimed in the service,
and dismissed without a pension.</p>

<p>“Thus qualified, no vicissitudes could be either
very new or very perplexing, and he commenced
operations without delay, and pursued them long
without desertion. The ‘first move’ in his mendicant
career was <i>taking them on the fly</i>; which
means meeting the gentry on their walks,
and beseeching or at times menacing them till
something is given; something in general <i>was</i>
given to get rid of the annoyance, and, till the
‘game got stale,’ an hour’s work, morning and
evening, produced a harvest of success, and ministered
to an occasion of debauchery.</p>

<p>“His less popular, but more upright father, had
once been a dog-fancier, and George, after many
years vicissitude, at length took a ‘fancy’ to the
same profession, but not on any principles recognised
by commercial laws. With what success he
has practised, the ladies and gentlemen about the
West-end have known, to their loss and disappointment,
for more than fifteen years past.</p>

<p>“Although the police have been and still are
on the alert, George has, in every instance, hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
escaped punishment, while numerous detections
connected with escape have enabled the offender
to hold these officials at defiance. The ‘modus
operandi’ upon which George proceeds is to
varnish his hands with a sort of gelatine, composed
of the coarsest pieces of liver, fried, pulverised,
and mixed up with tincture of myrrh.”
[This is the composition of which Inspector
Shackell spoke before the Select Committee,
but he did not seem to know of what the lure
was concocted. My correspondent continues]:
“Chelsea George caresses every animal who
seems ‘a likely spec,’ and when his fingers have
been rubbed over the dogs’ noses they become easy
and perhaps willing captives. A bag carried for
the purpose, receives the victim, and away goes
George, bag and all, to his printer’s in Seven
Dials. Two bills and no less&mdash;two and no more,
for such is George’s style of work&mdash;are issued to
describe the animal that has thus been <i>found</i>,
and which will be ‘restored to its owner on payment
of expenses.’ One of these George puts in
his pocket, the other he pastes up at a public-house
whose landlord is ‘fly’ to its meaning, and
poor ‘bow-wow’ is sold to a ‘dealer in dogs,’ not
very far from Sharp’s alley. In course of time
the dog is discovered; the possessor refers to the
‘establishment’ where he bought it; the ‘dealer
makes himself <i>square</i>,’ by giving the address of
‘the chap he bought ’un of,’ and Chelsea George
shows a copy of the advertisement, calls in the
publican as a witness, and leaves the place ‘without
the slightest imputation on his character.’ Of this
man’s earnings I cannot speak with precision: it is
probable that in a ‘good year’ his clear income is
200<i>l.</i>; in a bad year but 100<i>l.</i>, but, as he is very
adroit, I am inclined to believe that the ‘good’
years somewhat predominate, and that the average
income may therefore exceed 150<i>l.</i> yearly.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Present Street-Sellers of Dogs.</span></h3>

<p>It will have been noticed that in the accounts I
have given of the former street-transactions in
dogs, there is no mention of the <i>sellers</i>. The information
I have adduced is a condensation of the
evidence given before the Select Committee of the
House of Commons, and the inquiry related only
to the stealing, finding, and restoring of dogs, the
selling being but an incidental part of the evidence.
Then, however, as now, the street-sellers were not
implicated in the thefts or restitution of dogs,
“just except,” one man told me, “as there was a
black sheep or two in every flock.” The black
sheep, however, of this street-calling more frequently
meddled with restoring, than with “finding.”</p>

<p>Another street dog-seller, an intelligent man,&mdash;who,
however did not know so much as my first
informant of the state of the trade in the olden
time,&mdash;expressed a positive opinion, that no dog-stealer
was now a street-hawker (“hawker” was
the word I found these men use). His reasons for
this opinion, in addition to his own judgment from
personal knowledge, are cogent enough: “It isn’t
possible, sir,” he said, “and this is the reason
why. We are not a large body of men. We
stick pretty closely, when we are out, to the same
places. We are as well-known to the police, as
any men whom they most know, by sight at any
rate, from meeting them every day. Now, if a
lady or gentleman has lost a dog, or it’s been
stolen or strayed&mdash;and the most petted will sometimes
stray unaccountably and follow some stranger
or other&mdash;why where does she, and he, and all
the family, and all the servants, first look for the
lost animal? Why, where, but at the dogs we
are hawking? No, sir, it can’t be done now, and
it isn’t done in my knowledge, and it oughtn’t to
be done. I’d rather make 5<i>s.</i> on an honest dog
than 5<i>l.</i> on one that wasn’t, if there was no risk
about it either.” Other information convinces me
that this statement is correct.</p>

<p>Of these street-sellers or hawkers there are now
about twenty-five. There may be, however, but
twenty, if so many, on any given day in the streets,
as there are always some detained at home by
other avocations connected with their line of life.
The places they chiefly frequent are the Quadrant
and Regent-street generally, but the Quadrant far
the most. Indeed before the removal of the
colonnade, one-half at least of all the dog-sellers
of London would resort there on a very wet day,
as they had the advantage of shelter, and generally
of finding a crowd assembled, either lounging
to pass the time, or waiting “for a fair fit,” and so
with leisure to look at dogs. The other places are
the West-end squares, the banks of the Serpentine,
Charing-cross, the Royal Exchange, and the Bank
of England, and the Parks generally. They visit,
too, any public place to which there may be a temporary
attraction of the classes likely to be purchasers&mdash;a
mere crowd of people, I was told,
was no good to the dog-hawkers, it must be a
crowd of people that had money&mdash;such as the
assemblage of ladies and gentlemen who crowd
the windows of Whitehall and Parliament-street,
when the Queen opens or prorogues the houses.
These spectators fill the street and the Horse-guards’
portion of the park as soon as the street
mass has dispersed, and they often afford the
means of a good day’s work to the dog people.</p>

<p>Two dogs, carefully cleaned and combed, or
brushed, are carried in a man’s arms for street-vending.
A fine chain is generally attached to a
neat collar, so that the dog can be relieved from
the cramped feel he will experience if kept off his
feet too long. In carrying these little animals for
sale&mdash;for it is the smaller dogs which are carried&mdash;the
men certainly display them to the best advantage.
Their longer silken ears, their prominent
dark eyes and black noses, and the delicacy of
their fore-paws, are made as prominent as possible,
and present what the masses very well call “quite
a pictur.” I have alluded to the display of the
<i>Spaniels</i>, as they constitute considerably more
than half of the street trade in dogs, the “King
Charleses” and the “Blenheims” being disposed of
in nearly equal quantities. They are sold for lap-dogs,
pets, carriage companions or companions in
a walk, and are often intelligent and affectionate.
Their colours are black, black and tan, white and
liver-colour, chestnut, black and white, and entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
white, with many shades of these hues, and inter-blendings
of them, one with another, and with
gray.</p>

<p>The small <i>Terriers</i> are, however, coming more
into fashion, or, as the hawkers call it, into
“vogue.” They are usually black, with tanned
muzzles and feet, and with a keen look, their
hair being short and smooth. Some, however, are
preferred with long and somewhat wiry hair, and
the colour is often strongly mixed with gray. A
small Isle of Skye terrier&mdash;but few, I was informed
know a “real Skye”&mdash;is sometimes carried
in the streets, as well as the little rough
dogs known as Scotch terriers. When a street-seller
has a litter of terrier pups, he invariably
selects the handsomest for the streets, for it
happens&mdash;my informant did not know why, but
he and others were positive that so it was&mdash;that
the handsomest is the worst; “the worst,” it
must be understood as regards the possession of
choice sporting qualities, more especially of pluck.
The terrier’s education, as regards his prowess in
a rat-pit, is accordingly neglected; and if a gentleman
ask, “Will he kill rats?” the answer is in
the negative; but this is no disparagement to the
sale, because the dog is sold, perhaps, for a lady’s
pet, and is not wanted to kill rats, or to “fight
any dog of his weight.”</p>

<p>The <i>Pugs</i>, for which, 40 to 50 years ago, and,
in a diminished degree, 30 years back, there was,
in the phrase of the day, “quite a rage,” provided
only the pug was hideous, are now never
offered in the streets, or so rarely, that a well-known
dealer assured me he had only sold one in
the streets for two years. A Leadenhall tradesman,
fond of dogs, but in no way connected with
the trade, told me that it came to be looked upon,
that a pug was a fit companion for only snappish
old maids, and “so the women wouldn’t have them
any longer, least of all the old maids.”</p>

<p><i>French Poodles</i> are also of rare street-sale.
One man had a white poodle two or three years
ago, so fat and so round, that a lady, who priced
it, was told by a gentleman with her, that if
the head and the short legs were removed, and
the inside scooped out, the animal would make a
capital muff; yet even <i>that</i> poodle was difficult
of sale at 50<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Occasionally also an <i>Italian Greyhound</i>, seeming
cold and shivery on the warmest days, is
borne in a hawker’s arms, or if following on foot,
trembling and looking sad, as if mentally murmuring
at the climate.</p>

<p>In such places as the banks of the Serpentine,
or in the Regent’s-park, the hawker does not
carry his dogs in his arms, so much as let them
trot along with him in a body, and they are sure
to attract attention; or he sits down, and they
play or sleep about him. One dealer told me that
children often took such a fancy for a pretty
spaniel, that it was difficult for either mother,
governess, or nurse, to drag them away until the
man was requested to call in the evening, bringing
with him the dog, which was very often bought,
or the hawker recompensed for his loss of time.
But sometimes the dog-dealers, I heard from
several, meet with great shabbiness among rich
people, who recklessly give them no small trouble,
and sometimes put them to expense without the
slightest return, or even an acknowledgment or a
word of apology. “There’s one advantage in my
trade,” said a dealer in live animals, “we always
has to do with principals. There’s never a lady
would let her most favouritest maid choose her dog
for her. So no parkisits.”</p>

<p>The species which I have enumerated are all
that are now sold in the streets, with the exception
of an odd “plum-pudding,” or coach-dog (the
white dog with dark spots which runs after carriages),
or an odd bull-dog, or bull-terrier, or
indeed with the exception of “odd dogs” of every
kind. The hawkers are, however, connected with
the trade in sporting dogs, and often through the
medium of their street traffic, as I shall show
under the next head of my subject.</p>

<p>There is one peculiarity in the hawking of fancy
dogs, which distinguishes it from all other branches
of street-commerce. The purchasers are all of the
wealthier class. This has had its influence on the
manners of the dog-sellers. They will be found,
in the majority of cases, quiet and deferential
men, but without servility, and with little of the
quality of speech; and I speak only of speech
which among English people is known as
“gammon,” and among Irish people as “blarney.”
This manner is common to many; to the
established trainer of race-horses for instance,
who is in constant communication with persons in
a very superior position in life to his own, and to
whom he is exceedingly deferential. But the
trainer feels that in all points connected with his
not very easy business, as well, perhaps, as in
general turf knowingness, his royal highness (as
was the case once), or his grace, or my lord, or Sir
John, was inferior to himself; and so with all his
deference there mingles a strain of quiet contempt,
or rather, perhaps, of conscious superiority, which
is one ingredient in the formation of the manners I
have hastily sketched.</p>

<p>The customers of the street-hawkers of dogs are
ladies and gentlemen, who buy what may have
attracted their admiration. The kept mistresses
of the wealthier classes are often excellent customers.
“Many of ’em, I know,” was said to
me, “dotes on a nice spaniel. Yes, and I’ve
known gentlemen buy dogs for their misses; I
couldn’t be mistaken when I might be sent on
with them, which was part of the bargain. If it
was a two-guinea dog or so, I was told never to
give a hint of the price to the servant, or to anybody.
<i>I</i> know why. It’s easy for a gentleman
that wants to please a lady, and not to lay out any
great matter of tin, to say that what had really
cost him two guineas, cost him twenty.” If one
of the working classes, or a small tradesman, buy
a dog in the streets, it is generally because he is
“of a fancy turn,” and breeds a few dogs, and
traffics in them in hopes of profit.</p>

<p>The homes of the dog-hawkers, as far as I had
means of ascertaining&mdash;and all I saw were of the
same character&mdash;are comfortable and very cleanly.
The small spaniels, terriers, &amp;c.,&mdash;I do not now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
allude to sporting dogs&mdash;are generally kept in
kennels, or in small wooden houses erected for the
purpose in a back garden or yard. These abodes
are generally in some open court, or little square
or “grove,” where there is a free access of air.
An old man who was sitting at his door in the
summer evening, when I called upon a dog-seller,
and had to wait a short time, told me that so
quiet were his next-door neighbour’s (the street-hawker’s)
dogs, that for some weeks, he did not
know his newly-come neighbour was a dog-man;
although he was an old nervous man himself, and
couldn’t bear any unpleasant noise or smell. The
scrupulous observance of cleanliness is necessary
in the rearing or keeping of small fancy dogs, for
without such observance the dog would have a
disagreeable odour about it, enough to repel any
lady-buyer. It is a not uncommon declaration
among dog-sellers that the animals are “as sweet
as nuts.” Let it be remembered that I have been
describing the class of regular dog-sellers, making,
by an open and established trade, a tolerable
livelihood.</p>

<p>The spaniels, terriers, &amp;c., the stock of these
hawkers, are either bred by them&mdash;and they all
breed a few or a good many dogs&mdash;or they are
purchased of dog-dealers (not street-sellers), or of
people who having a good fancy breed of “King
Charleses,” or “Blenheims,” rear dogs, and sell
them by the litter to the hawkers. The hawkers
also buy dogs brought to them, “in the way of
business,” but they are wary how they buy any
animal suspected to be stolen, or they may get
into “trouble.” One man, a carver and gilder, I
was informed, some ten years back, made a good
deal of money by his “black-patched” spaniels.
These dogs had a remarkable black patch over
their eyes, and so fond was the dog-fancier, or
breeder of them, that when he disposed of them
to street-sellers or others, he usually gave a portrait
of the animals, of his own rude painting, into
the bargain. These paintings he also sold, slightly
framed, and I have seen them&mdash;but not so much
lately&mdash;offered in the streets, and hung up in
poor persons’ rooms. This man lived in York-square,
behind the Colosseum, then a not very
reputable quarter. It is now Munster-square, and
of a reformed character, but the seller of dogs and
the donor of their portraits has for some time been
lost sight of.</p>

<p>The prices at which fancy-dogs are sold in the
streets are about the same for all kinds. They
run from 10<i>s.</i> to 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>, but are very rarely so
low as 10<i>s.</i>, as “it’s only a very scrubby thing for
that.” Two and three guineas are frequent street
prices for a spaniel or small terrier. Of the dogs
sold, as I have before stated, more than one-half
are spaniels. Of the remainder, more than one-half
are terriers; and the surplusage, after this reckoning,
is composed in about equal numbers of the
other dogs I have mentioned. The exportation
of dogs is not above a twentieth of what it was
before the appointment of the Select Committee,
but a French or Belgium dealer sometimes comes
to London to buy dogs.</p>

<p>It is not easy to fix upon any per-centage as to
the profit of the street dog-sellers. There is the
keep and the rearing of the animal to consider;
and there is the same uncertainty in the traffic as
in all traffics which depend, not upon a demand
for use, but on the caprices of fashion, or&mdash;to use
the more appropriate word, when writing on such
a subject&mdash;of “fancy.” A hawker may sell three
dogs in one day, without any extraordinary effort,
or, in the same manner of trading, and frequenting
the very same places, may sell only one in three
days. In the winter, the dogs are sometimes offered
in public houses, but seldom as regards the
higher-priced animals.</p>

<p>From the best data I can command, it appears
that each hawker sells “three dogs and a half, if
you take it that way, splitting a dog like, every
week the year through; that is, sir, four or five
one week in the summer, when trade’s brisk and
days are long, and only two or three the next
week, when trade may be flat, and in winter
when there isn’t the same chance.” Calculating,
then, that seven dogs are sold by each hawker in a
fortnight, at an average price of 50<i>s.</i> each, which
is not a high average, and supposing that but
twenty men are trading in this line the year
through, we find that no less a sum than 9100<i>l.</i>
is yearly expended in this street-trade. The weekly
profit of the hawker is from 25<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i> More
than seven-eighths of these dogs are bred in this
country, Italian greyhounds included.</p>

<p>A hawker of dogs gave me a statement of his
life, but it presented so little of incident or of
change, that I need not report it. He had assisted
and then succeeded his father in the business;
was a pains-taking, temperate, and industrious
man, seldom taking even a glass of ale,
so that the tenour of his way had been even, and
he was prosperous enough.</p>

<p>I will next give an account of the connection
of the hawkers of dogs with the “sporting” or
“fancy” part of the business; and of the present
state of dog “finding,” to show the change since
the parliamentary investigation.</p>

<p>I may observe that in this traffic the word
“fancy” has two significations. A dog recommended
by its beauty, or any peculiarity, so that
it be suitable for a pet-dog, is a “fancy” animal;
so is he if he be a fighter, or a killer of rats, however
ugly or common-looking; but the term “sporting
dog” seems to become more and more used in this
case: nor is the first-mentioned use of the word
“fancy,” at all strained or very original, for it is
lexicographically defined as “an opinion bred
rather by the imagination than the reason, inclination,
liking, caprice, humour, whim, frolick,
idle scheme, vagary.”</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Sporting Dogs.</span></h3>

<p>The use, if use it may be styled, of sporting, or
fighting dogs, is now a mere nothing to what it
once was. There are many sports&mdash;an appellation
of many a brute cruelty&mdash;which have become extinct,
some of them long extinct. Herds of bears,
for instance, were once maintained in this country,
merely to be baited by dogs. It was even a part
of royal merry-making. It was a sport altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
congenial to the spirit of Henry VIII.; and when
his daughter, then Queen Mary, visited her sister
Elizabeth at Hatfield House, now the residence
of the Marquess of Salisbury, there was a bear-baiting
for their delectation&mdash;<i>after mass</i>. Queen
Elizabeth, on her accession to the throne, seems
to have been very partial to the baiting of bears
and of bulls; for she not unfrequently welcomed
a foreign ambassador with such exhibitions. The
historians of the day intimate&mdash;they dared do no
more&mdash;that Elizabeth affected these rough sports
the most in the decline of life, when she wished
to seem still sprightly, active, and healthful, in the
eyes of her courtiers and her subjects. Laneham,
whose veracity has not been impeached&mdash;though
Sir Walter Scott has pronounced him to be as
thorough a coxcomb as ever blotted paper&mdash;thus
describes a bear-bait in presence of the Queen,
and after quoting his description I gladly leave
the subject. I make the citation in order to show
and contrast the former with the present use of
sporting dogs.</p>

<p>“It was a sport very pleasant to see the bear,
with his pink eyes leering after his enemies, approach;
the nimbleness and wait of the dog to
take his advantage; and the force and experience
of the bear again to avoid his assaults: if he were
bitten in one place, how he would pinch in another
to get free; that if he were taken once,
then by what shift with biting, with clawing,
with roaring with tossing and tumbling, he would
work and wind himself from them; and, when he
was loose, to shake his ears twice or thrice, with
the blood and the slaver hanging about his physiognomy.”</p>

<p>The suffering which constituted the great delight
of the <i>sport</i> was even worse than this, in
bull-baiting, for the bull gored or tossed the dogs
to death more frequently than the bear worried
or crushed them.</p>

<p>The principal place for the carrying on of these
barbarities was at Paris Garden, not far from St.
Saviour’s Church, Southwark. The clamour, and
wrangling, and reviling, with and without blows,
at these places, gave a proverbial expression to the
language. “The place was like a bear-garden,”
for “gardens” they were called. These pastimes
beguiled the <i>Sunday</i> afternoons more than any
other time, and were among the chief delights of
the people, “until,” writes Dr. Henry, collating
the opinions of the historians of the day, “until
the refined amusements of the drama, possessing
themselves by degrees of the public taste, if they
did not mend the morals of the age, at least forced
brutal barbarity to quit the stage.”</p>

<p>Of this sport in Queen Anne’s days, Strutt’s
industry has collected advertisements telling of
bear and bull-baiting at Hockley-in-the-Hole,
and “Tuttle”-fields, Westminster, and of dog-fights
at the same places. Marylebone was
another locality famous for these pastimes, and
for its breed of mastiffs, which dogs were most
used for baiting the bears, whilst bull-dogs
were the antagonists of the bull. Gay, who
was a sufficiently close observer, and a close
observer of street-life too, as is well shown in
his “Trivia,” specifies these localities in one of
his <span class="lock">fables:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Both Hockley-hole and Mary-bone</div>
      <div class="verse">The combats of my dog have known.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hockley-hole was not far from Smithfield-market.</p>

<p>In the same localities the practice of these
sports lingered, becoming less and less every year,
until about the middle of the last century. In
the country, bull-baiting was practised twenty
times more commonly than bear-baiting; for bulls
were plentiful, and bears were not. There are,
perhaps, none of our older country towns without
the relic of its bull-ring&mdash;a strong iron ring inserted
into a large stone in the pavement, to which
the baited bull was tied; or a knowledge of the
site where the bull-ring was. The deeds of the
baiting-dogs were long talked of by the vulgar.
These sports, and the dog-fights, maintained the
great demand for sporting dogs in former times.</p>

<p>The only sporting dogs now in request&mdash;apart,
of course, from hunting and shooting (remnants
of the old barbarous delight in torture or
slaughter), for I am treating only of the street-trade,
to which fox-hounds, harriers, pointers,
setters, cockers, &amp;c., &amp;c., are unknown&mdash;are
terriers and bull-terriers. Bull-dogs cannot now
be classed as sporting, but only as fancy dogs, for
they are not good fighters, I was informed, one
with another, their mouths being too small.</p>

<p>The way in which the sale of sporting dogs is
connected with street-traffic is in this wise: Occasionally
a sporting-dog is offered for sale in the
streets, and then, of course, the trade is direct. At
other times, gentlemen buying or pricing the
smaller dogs, ask the cost of a bull-dog, or a bull-terrier
or rat-terrier, and the street-seller at once
offers to supply them, and either conducts them to
a dog-dealer’s, with whom he may be commercially
connected, and where they can purchase those
dogs, or he waits upon them at their residences
with some “likely animals.” A dog-dealer told
me that he hardly knew what made many gentlemen
so fond of bull-dogs, and they were “the
fonder on ’em the more blackguarder and varmint-looking
the creatures was,” although now they
were useless for sport, and the great praise of a
bull-dog, “never flew but at head in his life,” was
no longer to be given to him, as there were no
bulls at whose heads he could now fly.</p>

<p>Another dog-dealer informed me&mdash;with what
truth as to the judgment concerning horses I do
not know, but no doubt with accuracy as to the
purchase of the dogs&mdash;that Ibrahim Pacha, when
in London, thought little of the horses which he
saw, but was delighted with the bull-dogs, “and
he weren’t so werry unlike one in the face hisself,”
was said at the time by some of the fancy.
Ibrahim, it seems, bought two of the finest
and largest bull-dogs in London, of Bill George,
giving no less than 70<i>l.</i> for the twain. The bull-dogs
now sold by the street-folk, or through their
agency in the way I have described, are from
5<i>l.</i> to 25<i>l.</i> each. The bull-terriers, of the best
blood, are about the same price, or perhaps 10 to
15 per cent. lower, and rarely attaining the tip-top
price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The bull-terriers, as I have stated, are now the
chief fighting-dogs, but the patrons of those combats&mdash;of
those small imitations of the savage tastes
of the Roman Colosseum, may deplore the decay
of the amusement. From the beginning, until well
on to the termination of the last century, it was
not uncommon to see announcements of “twenty
dogs to fight for a collar,” though such advertisements
were far more common at the commencement
than towards the close of the century. Until
within these twelve years, indeed, dog-matches
were not unfrequent in London, and the favourite
time for the regalement was on Sunday mornings.
There were dog-pits in Westminster, and elsewhere,
to which the admission was not very easy, for
only known persons were allowed to enter. The
expense was considerable, the risk of punishment
was not a trifle, and it is evident that this Sunday
game was <i>not supported by the poor or working
classes</i>. Now dog-fights are rare. “There’s not
any public dog-fights,” I was told, “and very
seldom any in a pit at a public-house, but there’s
a good deal of it, I know, <i>at the private houses of
the nobs</i>.” I may observe that “the nobs” is a
common designation for the rich among these sporting
people.</p>

<p>There are, however, occasionally dog-fights in a
sporting-house, and the order of the combat is
thus described to me: “We’ll say now that it’s a
scratch fight; two dogs have each their corner of
a pit, and they’re set to fight. They’ll fight
on till they go down together, and then if one
leave hold, he’s sponged. Then they fight again.
If a dog has the worst of it he mustn’t be picked
up, but if he gets into his corner, then he can
stay for as long as may be agreed upon, minute
or half-minute time, or more than a minute. If
a dog won’t go to the scratch out of his corner,
he loses the fight. If they fight on, why to
settle it, one must be killed&mdash;though that very
seldom happens, for if a dog’s very much punished,
he creeps to his corner and don’t come out
to time, and so the fight’s settled. Sometimes
it’s agreed beforehand, that the master of a dog
may give in for him; sometimes that isn’t to be
allowed; but there’s next to nothing of this now,
unless it’s in private among the nobs.”</p>

<p>It has been said that a sportsman&mdash;perhaps in
the relations of life a benevolent man&mdash;when he
has failed to kill a grouse or pheasant outright, and
proceeds to grasp the fluttering and agonised bird
and smash its skull against the barrel of his gun,
reconciles himself to the sufferings he inflicts by
the <i>pride of art</i>, the consciousness of skill&mdash;he has
brought down his bird at a long shot; that, too,
when he cares nothing for the possession of the
bird. The same feeling hardens him against the
most piteous, woman-like cry of the hare, so shot
that it cannot run. Be this as it may, it cannot
be urged that in matching a favourite dog there
can be any such feeling to destroy the sympathy.
The men who thus amuse themselves are then
utterly insensible to any pang at the infliction of
pain upon animals, witnessing the infliction of it
merely for a passing excitement: and in this
insensibility the whole race who cater to such
recreations of the wealthy, as well as the wealthy
themselves, participate. There is another feeling
too at work, and one proper to the sporting character&mdash;every
man of this class considers the
glories of his horse or his dog his own, a feeling
very dear to selfishness.</p>

<p>The main sport now, however, in which dogs
are the agents is rat-hunting. It is called hunting,
but as the rats are all confined in a pit it is more
like mere killing. Of this sport I have given
some account under the head of rat-catching. The
dogs used are all terriers, and are often the property
of the street-sellers. The most accomplished of
this terrier race was the famous dog Billy, the
eclipse of the rat pit. He is now enshrined&mdash;for
a stuffed carcase is all that remains of Billy&mdash;in
a case in the possession of Charley Heslop of
the Seven Bells behind St. Giles’s Church, with
whom Billy lived and died. His great feat was
that he killed 100 rats in five minutes. I understand,
however, that it is still a moot point in the
sporting world, whether Billy did or did not
exceed the five minutes by a very few seconds. A
merely average terrier will easily kill fifty rats in
a pit in eight minutes, but many far exceed such a
number. One dealer told me that he would back
a terrier bitch which did not weigh 12 lbs. to kill
100 rats in six minutes. The price of these dogs
ranges with that of the bull-terriers.</p>

<p>The passion for rat-hunting is evidently on the
increase, and seems to have attained the popularity
once vouchsafed to cock-fighting. There
are now about seventy regular pits in London,
besides a few that are run up for temporary purposes.
The landlord of a house in the Borough,
familiar with these sports, told me that they
would soon have to breed rats for a sufficient
supply!</p>

<p>But it is not for the encounter with dogs alone,
the issue being that so many rats shall be killed
in a given time, that these vermin are becoming a
trade commodity. Another use for them is announced
in the following <span class="lock">card:&mdash;</span></p>

Under the Management of &mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>As a rat-killer, a ferret is not to be compared
to a dog; but his use is to kill rats in holes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
inaccessible to dogs, or to drive the vermin out of
their holes into some open space, where they can
be destroyed. Ferrets are worth from 1<i>l.</i> to 4<i>l.</i>
They are not animals of street-sale.</p>

<p>The management of these sports is principally
in the hands of the street dog-sellers, as indeed is
the dog-trade generally. They are the breeders,
dealers, and sellers. They are compelled, as it
were, to exhibit their dogs in the streets, that
they may attract the attention of the rich, who
would not seek them in their homes in the suburbs.
The evening business in rat-hunting, &amp;c., for such
it is principally, perhaps doubles the incomes I
have specified as earned merely by street-<i>sale</i>. The
amount “turned over” in the trade in sporting-dogs
yearly in London, was computed for me by
one of the traders at from 12,000<i>l.</i> to 15,000<i>l.</i>
He could not, however, lay down any very precise
statistics, as some bull-dogs, bull-terriers, &amp;c., were
bred by butchers, tanners, publicans, horse-dealers,
and others, and disposed of privately.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In my account of the former condition of the
dog-trade, I had to dwell principally on the stealing
and restoring of dogs. This is now the least
part of the subject. The alteration in the law,
consequent upon the parliamentary inquiry, soon
wrought a great change, especially the enactment
of the 6th Sect. in the Act 8 and 9 Vict. c. 47.
“Any person who shall corruptly take any money
or reward, directly or indirectly, under pretence
or upon account of aiding any person to recover
any dog which shall have been stolen, or which
shall be in the possession of any person not being
the owner thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour,
and punishable accordingly.”</p>

<p>There may now, I am informed, be half a dozen
fellows who make a precarious living by dog-stealing.
These men generally keep out of the way
of the street dog-sellers, who would not scruple,
they assure me, to denounce their practices, as
the more security a purchaser feels in the property
and possession of a dog, the better it is for the
regular business. One of these dog-stealers, dressed
like a lime-burner&mdash;they generally appear as mechanics&mdash;was
lately seen to attempt the enticing
away of a dog. Any idle good-for-nothing fellow,
slinking about the streets, would also, I
was informed, seize any stray dog within his
reach, and sell it for any trifle he could obtain.
One dealer told me that there might still be a
little doing in the “restoring” way, and with
that way of life were still mixed up names which
figured in the parliamentary inquiry, but it was
a mere nothing to what it was formerly.</p>

<p>From a man acquainted with the dog business
I had the following account. My informant was
not at present connected with the dog and rat
business, but he seemed to have what is called a
“hankering after it.” He had been a pot-boy in
his youth, and had assisted at the bar of public-houses,
and so had acquired a taste for sporting, as
some “fancy coves” were among the frequenters
of the tap-room and skittle-ground. He had
speculated a little in dogs, which a friend reared,
and he sold to the public-house customers. “At
last I went slap into the dog-trade,” he said,
“but I did no good at all. There’s a way to do
it, I dare say, or perhaps you must wait to get
known, but then you may starve as you wait. I
tried Smithfield first&mdash;it’s a good bit since, but I
can’t say how long&mdash;and I had a couple of tidy
little terriers that we’d bred; I thought I’d begin
cheap to turn over money quick, so I asked 12<i>s.</i>
a-piece for them. O, in course they weren’t a
werry pure sort. But I couldn’t sell at all. If a
grazier, or a butcher, or anybody looked at them,
and asked their figure, they’d say, ‘Twelve
shillings! a dog what ain’t worth more nor 12<i>s.</i>
ain’t worth a <span class="lock">d&mdash;n!’</span> I asked one gent a sovereign,
but there was a lad near that sung out,
‘Why, you only axed 12<i>s.</i> a bit since; ain’t you
a-coming it?’ After that, I was glad to get away.
I had five dogs when I started, and about 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
in money, and some middling clothes; but my
money soon went, for I could do no business, and
there was the rent, and then the dogs must be
properly fed, or they’d soon show it. At last,
when things grew uncommon taper, I almost
grudged the poor things their meat and their sop,
for they were filling their bellies, and I was an
’ung’ring. I got so seedy, too, that it was no use
trying the streets, for any one would think I’d
stole the dogs. So I sold them one by one. I
think I got about 5<i>s.</i> apiece for them, for people
took their advantage on me. After that I fasted
oft enough. I helped about the pits, and looked
out for jobs of any kind, cleaning knives and spittoons
at a public-house, and such-like, for a bite
and sup. And I sometimes got leave to sit up all
night in a stable or any out-house with a live rat
trap that I could always borrow, and catch rats to
sell to the dealers. If I could get three lively rats
in a night, it was good work, for it was as good as
1<i>s.</i> to me. I sometimes won a pint, or a tanner,
when I could cover it, by betting on a rat-hunt
with helpers like myself&mdash;but it was only a few
places we were let into, just where I was known&mdash;’cause
I’m a good judge of a dog, you see, and
if I had it to try over again, I think I could knock a
tidy living out of dog-selling. Yes, I’d like to try well
enough, but it’s no use trying if you haven’t a
fairish bit of money. I’d only myself to keep all this
time, but that was one too many. I got leave to sleep
in hay-lofts, or stables, or anywhere, and I have
slept in the park. I don’t know how many
months I was living this way. I got not to mind
it much at last. Then I got to carry out the day
and night beers for a potman what had hurt his
foot and couldn’t walk quick and long enough for
supplying his beer, as there was five rounds every
day. He lent me an apron and a jacket to be
decent. After that I got a potman’s situation.
No, I’m not much in the dog and rat line now,
and don’t see much of it, for I’ve very little
opportunity. But I’ve a very nice Scotch terrier
to sell if you should be wanting such a thing, or
hear of any of your friends wanting one. It’s
dirt cheap at 30<i>s.</i>, just about a year old. Yes, I
generally has a dog, and swops and sells. Most
masters allows that in a quiet respectable way.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Sellers of Live Birds.</span></h3>

<p>The bird-<i>sellers</i> in the streets are also the bird-<i>catchers</i>
in the fields, plains, heaths, and woods,
which still surround the metropolis; and in compliance
with established precedent it may be
proper that I should give an account of the catching,
before I proceed to any further statement of
the procedures subsequent thereunto. The bird-catchers
are precisely what I have described them
in my introductory remarks. An intelligent man,
versed in every part of the bird business, and well
acquainted with the character of all engaged in it,
said they might be represented as of “the fancy,”
in a small way, and always glad to run after, and
full of admiration of, fighting men. The bird-catcher’s
life is one essentially vagrant; a few
gipsies pursue it, and they mix little in street-trades,
except as regards tinkering; and the mass,
not gipsies, who become bird-catchers, rarely leave
it for any other avocation. They “catch” unto
old age. During last winter two men died in the
parish of Clerkenwell, both turned seventy, and
both bird-catchers&mdash;a profession they had followed
from the age of six.</p>

<p>The mode of catching I will briefly describe.
It is principally effected by means of nets. A
bird-net is about twelve yards square; it is spread
flat upon the ground, to which it is secured by
four “stars.” These are iron pins, which are
inserted in the field, and hold the net, but so that
the two “wings,” or “flaps,” which are indeed the
sides of the nets, are not confined by the stars.
In the middle of the net is a cage with a fine wire
roof, widely worked, containing the “call-bird.”
This bird is trained to sing loudly and cheerily,
great care being bestowed upon its tuition, and
its song attracts the wild birds. Sometimes a
few stuffed birds are spread about the cage as if
a flock were already assembling there. The bird-catcher
lies flat and motionless on the ground, 20
or 30 yards distant from the edge of the net. As
soon as he considers that a sufficiency of birds
have congregated around his decoy, he rapidly
draws towards him a line, called the “pull-line,”
of which he has kept hold. This is so looped and
run within the edges of the net, that on being
smartly pulled, the two wings of the net collapse
and fly together, the stars still keeping their hold,
and the net encircles the cage of the call-bird, and
incloses in its folds all the wild birds allured
round it. In fact it then resembles a great cage
of net-work. The captives are secured in cages&mdash;the
call-bird continuing to sing as if in mockery of
their struggles&mdash;or in hampers proper for the
purpose, which are carried on the man’s back to
London.</p>

<p>The use of the call-bird as a means of decoy is
very ancient. Sometimes&mdash;and more especially
in the dark, as in the taking of nightingales&mdash;the
bird-catcher imitates the notes of the birds to be
captured. A small instrument has also been used
for the purpose, and to this Chaucer, although
figuratively, alludes: “So, the birde is begyled
with the merry voice of the foulers’ whistel, when
it is closed in your nette.”</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the pride of the season, a bird-catcher
engages a costermonger’s poney or donkey
cart, and perhaps his boy, the better to convey
the birds to town. The net and its apparatus
cost 1<i>l.</i> The call-bird, if he have a good wild
note&mdash;goldfinches and linnets being principally so
used&mdash;is worth 10<i>s.</i> at the least.</p>

<p>The bird-catcher’s life has many, and to the
constitution of some minds, irresistible charms.
There is the excitement of “sport”&mdash;not the
headlong excitement of the chase, where the blood
is stirred by motion and exercise&mdash;but still sport
surpassing that of the angler, who plies his finest
art to capture one fish at a time, while the bird-catcher
despises an individual capture, but seeks
to ensnare a flock at one twitch of a line. There
is, moreover, the attraction of idleness, at least for
intervals, and sometimes long intervals&mdash;perhaps
the great charm of fishing&mdash;and basking in the
lazy sunshine, to watch the progress of the snares.
Birds, however, and more especially linnets, are
caught in the winter, when it is not quite such
holiday work. A bird-dealer (not a street-seller)
told me that the greatest number of birds he had
ever heard of as having been caught at one pull
was nearly 200. My informant happened to be
present on the occasion. “Pulls” of 50, 100,
and 150 are not very unfrequent when the young
broods are all on the wing.</p>

<p>Of the bird-catchers, including all who reside
in Woolwich, Greenwich, Hounslow, Isleworth,
Barnet, Uxbridge, and places of similar distance,
all working for the London market, there are
about 200. The localities where these men
“catch,” are the neighbourhoods of the places I
have mentioned as their residences, and at Holloway,
Hampstead, Highgate, Finchley, Battersea,
Blackheath, Putney, Mortlake, Chiswick, Richmond,
Hampton, Kingston, Eltham, Carshalton,
Streatham, the Tootings, Woodford, Epping,
Snaresbrook, Walthamstow, Tottenham, Edmonton&mdash;wherever,
in fine, are open fields, plains, or
commons around the metropolis.</p>

<p>I will first enumerate the several birds sold in
the streets, as well as the supply to the shops by
the bird-catchers. I have had recourse to the
best sources of information. Of the number of
birds which I shall specify as “supplied,” or
“caught,” it must be remembered that a not-very-small
proportion die before they can be trained to
song, or inured to a cage life. I shall also give
the street prices. All the birds are caught by the
nets with call-birds, excepting such as I shall
notice. I take the singing birds first.</p>

<p>The <i>Linnet</i> is the cheapest and among the most
numerous of what may be called the London-caught
birds, for it is caught in the nearer suburbs, such
as Holloway. The linnet, however,&mdash;the brown
linnet being the species&mdash;is not easily reared, and
for some time ill brooks confinement. About one-half
of those birds die after having been caged a
few days. The other evening a bird-catcher
supplied 26 fine linnets to a shopkeeper in Pentonville,
and next morning ten were dead. But
in some of those bird shops, and bird chambers
connected with the shops, the heat at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the new broods are caught and caged, is excessive;
and the atmosphere, from the crowded
and compulsory fellowship of pigeons, and all
descriptions of small birds, with white rats,
hedgehogs, guinea-pigs, and other creatures, is
often very foul; so that the wonder is, not that
so many die, but that so many survive.</p>

<p>Some bird-connoisseurs prefer the note of the
linnet to that of the canary, but this is far from a
general preference. The young birds are sold in
the streets at 3<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i> each; the older birds,
which are accustomed to sing in their cages, from
1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The “catch” of linnets&mdash;none
being imported&mdash;may be estimated, for London
alone, at 70,000 yearly. The mortality I have
mentioned is confined chiefly to that year’s brood.
One-tenth of the catch is sold in the streets. Of
the quality of the street-sold birds I shall speak
hereafter.</p>

<p>The <i>Bullfinch</i>, which is bold, familiar, docile,
and easily attached, is a favourite cage-bird among
the Londoners; I speak of course as regards the
body of the people. It is as readily sold in the
streets as any other singing bird. Piping bullfinches
are also a part of street-trade, but only to
a small extent, and with bird-sellers who can
carry them from their street pitches, or call on
their rounds, at places where they are known, to
exhibit the powers of the bird. The piping is
taught to these finches when very young, and they
must be brought up by their tutor, and be familiar
with him. When little more than two months
old, they begin to whistle, and then their training
as pipers must commence. This tuition, among
professional bullfinch-trainers, is systematic. They
have schools of birds, and teach in bird-classes of
from four to seven members in each, six being a
frequent number. These classes, when their education
commences, are kept unfed for a longer
time than they have been accustomed to, and they
are placed in a darkened room. The bird is wakeful
and attentive from the want of his food, and
the tune he is to learn is played several times on
an instrument made for the purpose, and known
as a bird-organ, its notes resembling those of the
bullfinch. For an hour or two the young pupils mope
silently, but they gradually begin to imitate the
notes of the music played to them. When one
commences&mdash;and he is looked upon as the most
likely to make a good piper&mdash;the others soon
follow his example. The light is then admitted
and a portion of food, but not a full meal, is given
to the birds. Thus, by degrees, by the playing
on the bird-organ (a flute is sometimes used), by
the admission of light, which is always agreeable
to the finch, and by the reward of more and more,
and sometimes more relishable food, the pupil
“practises” the notes he hears continuously. The
birds are then given into the care of boys, who
attend to them without intermission in a similar
way, their original teacher still overlooking, praising,
or rating his scholars, till they acquire a
tune which they pipe as long as they live. It is
said, however, that only five per cent. of the number
taught pipe in <i>perfect</i> harmony. The bullfinch
is often pettish in his piping, and will in
many instances not pipe at all, unless in the
presence of some one who feeds it, or to whom it
has become attached.</p>

<p>The system of training I have described is that
practised by the Germans, who have for many
years supplied this country with the best piping
bullfinches. Some of the dealers will undertake
to procure English-taught bullfinches which will
pipe as well as the foreigners, but I am told
that this is a prejudice, if not a trick, of
trade. The mode of teaching in this country, by
barbers, weavers, and bird-fanciers generally, who
seek for a profit from their pains-taking, is somewhat
similar to that which I have detailed, but
with far less elaborateness. The price of a piping
bullfinch is about three guineas. These pipers are
also reared and taught in Leicestershire and Norfolk,
and sent to London, as are the singing bullfinches
which do not “pipe.”</p>

<p>The bullfinches netted near London are caught
more numerously about Hounslow than elsewhere.
In hard winters they are abundant in the outskirts
of the metropolis. The yearly supply,
including those sent from Norfolk, &amp;c., is about
30,000. The bullfinch is “hearty compared to
the linnet,” I was told, but of the amount which
are the objects of trade, not more than two-thirds
live many weeks. The price of a good young
bullfinch is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> They are often sold
in the streets for 1<i>s.</i> The hawking or street
trade comprises about a tenth of the whole.</p>

<p>The sale of piping bullfinches is, of course,
small, as only the rich can afford to buy them. A
dealer estimated it at about 400 yearly.</p>

<p>The <i>Goldfinch</i> is also in demand by street customers,
and is a favourite from its liveliness,
beauty, and sometimes sagacity. It is, moreover,
the longest lived of our caged small birds, and will
frequently live to the age of fifteen or sixteen
years. A goldfinch has been known to exist
twenty-three years in a cage. Small birds, generally,
rarely live more than nine years. This
finch is also in demand because it most readily of
any bird pairs with the canary, the produce being
known as a “mule,” which, from its prettiness
and powers of song, is often highly valued.</p>

<p>Goldfinches are sold in the streets at from 6<i>d.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> each, and when there is an extra catch, and
they are nearly all caught about London, and the
shops are fully stocked, at 3<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i> each. The
yearly catch is about the same as that of the linnet,
or 70,000, the mortality being perhaps 30 per
cent. If any one casts his eye over the stock of
hopping, chirping little creatures in the window of
a bird-shop, or in the close array of small cages
hung outside, or at the stock of a street-seller, he
will be struck by the preponderating number of
goldfinches. No doubt the dealer, like any other
shopkeeper, dresses his window to the best advantage,
putting forward his smartest and prettiest
birds. The demand for the goldfinch, especially
among women, is steady and regular. The street-sale
is a tenth of the whole.</p>

<p>The <i>Chaffinch</i> is in less request than either of
its congeners, the bullfinch or the goldfinch, but
the catch is about half that of the bullfinch, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
with the same rate of mortality. The prices are
also the same.</p>

<p><i>Greenfinches</i> (called <i>green birds</i>, or sometimes
<i>green linnets</i>, in the streets) are in still smaller
request than are chaffinches, and that to about
one-half. Even this smaller stock is little saleable,
as the bird is regarded as “only a middling
singer.” They are sold in the open air, at 2<i>d.</i> and
3<i>d.</i> each, but a good “green bird” is worth 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>Larks</i> are of good sale and regular supply,
being perhaps more readily caught than other
birds, as in winter they congregate in large
quantities. It may be thought, to witness the
restless throwing up of the head of the caged
sky-lark, as if he were longing for a soar in the
air, that he was very impatient of restraint. This
does not appear to be so much the fact, as the
lark adapts himself to the poor confines of his
prison&mdash;poor indeed for a bird who soars higher
and longer than any of his class&mdash;more rapidly
than other wild birds, like the linnet, &amp;c. The
mortality of larks, however, approaches one-third.</p>

<p>The yearly “take” of larks is 60,000. This includes
sky-larks, wood-larks, tit-larks, and mud-larks.
The sky-lark is in far better demand than
any of the others for his “stoutness of song,” but
some prefer the tit-lark, from the very absence of
such stoutness. “Fresh-catched” larks are vended
in the streets at 6<i>d.</i> and 8<i>d.</i>, but a seasoned bird
is worth 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> One-tenth is the street-sale.</p>

<p>The larks for the supply of fashionable tables
are never provided by the London bird-catchers,
who catch only “singing larks,” for the shop and
street-traffic. The edible larks used to be highly
esteemed in pies, but they are now generally
roasted for consumption. They are principally the
produce of Cambridgeshire, with some from Bedfordshire,
and are sent direct (killed) to Leadenhall-market,
where about 215,000 are sold yearly,
being nearly two-thirds of the gross London consumption.</p>

<p>It is only within these twelve or fifteen years
that the London dealers have cared to trade to any
extent in <i>Nightingales</i>, but they are now a part
of the stock of every bird-shop of the more flourishing
class. Before that they were merely exceptional
as cage-birds. As it is, the “domestication,” if
the word be allowable with reference to the nightingale,
is but partial. Like all migratory birds,
when the season for migration approaches, the
caged nightingale shows symptoms of great uneasiness,
dashing himself against the wires of his
cage or his aviary, and sometimes dying in a few
days. Many of the nightingales, however, let the
season pass away without showing any consciousness
that it was, with the race of birds to which
they belonged, one for a change of place. To
induce the nightingale to sing in the daylight, a
paper cover is often placed over the cage, which
may be gradually and gradually withdrawn until
it can be dispensed with. This is to induce the
appearance of twilight or night. On the subject
of this night-singing, however, I will cite a short
passage.</p>

<p>“The Nightingale is usually supposed to withhold
his notes till the sun has set, and then to be
the only songster left. This is, however, not
quite true, for he sings in the day, often as sweetly
and as powerfully as at night; but amidst the
general chorus of other singing birds, his efforts
are little noticed. Neither is he by any means
the only feathered musician of the night. The
Wood-lark will, to a very late hour, pour forth its
rich notes, flying in circles round the female, when
sitting on her nest. The Sky-lark, too, may
frequently be heard till near midnight high in the
air, soaring as if in the brightness of a summer’s
morning. Again we have listened with pleasure
long after dark to the warblings of a Thrush, and
been awakened at two in the morning by its
sweet serenade.” It appears, however, that this
night-singing, as regards England, is on fine
summer nights when the darkness is never very
dense. In far northern climates larks sing all night.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that the mortality
among nightingales, before they are reconciled to
their new life, is higher than that of any other
bird, and much exceeding one-half. The dealers
may be unwilling to admit this; but such mortality
is, I have been assured on good authority,
the case; besides that, the habits of the nightingale
unfit him for a cage existence.</p>

<p>The capture of the nightingale is among the
most difficult achievements of the profession. None
are caught nearer than Epping, and the catchers
travel considerable distances before they have a
chance of success. These birds are caught at night,
and more often by their captor’s imitation of the
nightingale’s note, than with the aid of the call-bird.
Perhaps 1000 nightingales are reared yearly
in London, of which three-fourths may be, more
or less, songsters. The inferior birds are sold at
about 2<i>s.</i> each, the street-sale not reaching 100,
but the birds, “caged and singing,” are worth 1<i>l.</i>
each, when of the best; and 10<i>s.</i> 12<i>s.</i> and 15<i>s.</i>
each when approaching the best. The mortality I
have estimated.</p>

<p><i>Redbreasts</i> are a portion of the street-sold birds,
but the catch is not large, not exceeding 3000,
with a mortality of about a third. Even this number,
small as it is, when compared with the numbers
of other singing birds sold, is got rid of with difficulty.
There is a popular feeling repugnant to
the imprisonment, or coercion in any way, of
“a robin,” and this, no doubt has its influence in
moderating the demand. The redbreast is sold,
when young, both in the shops and streets for 1<i>s.</i>,
when caged and singing, sometimes for 1<i>l.</i> These
birds are considered to sing best by candlelight.
The street-sale is a fifth, or sometimes a quarter,
all young birds, or with the rarest exceptions.</p>

<p>The <i>Thrush</i>, <i>Throstle</i>, or (in Scottish poetry)
<i>Mavis</i>, is of good sale. It is reared by hand, for
the London market, in many of the villages and
small towns at no great distance, the nests being
robbed of the young, wherever they can be
found. The nestling food of the infant thrush
is grubs, worms, and snails, with an occasional
moth or butterfly. On this kind of diet the
young thrushes are reared until they are old
enough for sale to the shopkeeper, or to any
private patron. Thrushes are also netted, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
those reared by hand are much the best, as such
a rearing disposes the bird the more to enjoy his
cage life, as he has never experienced the delights
of the free hedges and thickets. This process
the catchers call “rising” from the nest. A
throstle thus “rose” soon becomes familiar with
his owner&mdash;always supposing that he be properly
fed and his cage duly cleaned, for all birds detest
dirt&mdash;and among the working-men of England no
bird is a greater favourite than the thrush; indeed
few other birds are held in such liking by the
artisan class. About a fourth of the thrushes
supplied to the metropolitan traders have been
thus “rose,” and as they must be sufficiently grown
before they will be received by the dealers, the
mortality among them, when once able to feed
themselves, in their wicker-work cages, is but
small. Perhaps somewhere about a fourth perish
in this hand-rearing, and some men, the aristocrats
of the trade, let a number go when they
have ascertained that they are hens, as these men
exert themselves to bring up thrushes to sing well,
and then they command good prices. Often enough,
however, the hens are sold cheap in the streets.
Among the catch supplied by netting, there is a
mortality of perhaps more than a third. The
whole take is about 35,000. Of the sale the
streets have a tenth proportion. The prices run
from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> for the “fresh-caught,” and
10<i>s.</i>, 1<i>l.</i>, and as much as 2<i>l.</i> for a seasoned throstle
in high song. Indeed I may observe that for any
singing bird, which is considered greatly to excel
its mates, a high price is obtainable.</p>

<p><i>Blackbirds</i> appear to be less prized in London
than thrushes, for, though with a mellower note,
the blackbird is not so free a singer in captivity.
They are “rose” and netted in the same manner
as the thrush, but the supply is less by one-fifth.
The prices, mortality, street-sale, &amp;c., are in the
same ratio.</p>

<p>The street-sale of <i>Canaries</i> is not large; not
so large, I am assured by men in the trade, as it
was six or seven years ago, more especially as regarded
the higher-priced birds of this open-air
traffic. Canaries are now never brought from the
group of islands, thirteen in number, situate in the
North Atlantic and near the African coast, and
from which they derive their name. To these
islands and to these alone (as far as is known to
ornithologists) are they indigenous. The canary is
a slow flyer and soon wearied; this is one reason
no doubt for its not migrating. This delightful
songster was first brought into England in the
reign of Elizabeth, at the era when so many
foreign luxuries (as they were then considered,
and stigmatised accordingly) were introduced;
of these were potatoes, tobacco, turkeys, nectarines,
and canaries. I have seen no account of
what was the cost of a canary-bird when first
imported, but there is no doubt that they were
very dear, as they were found only in the abodes
of the wealthy. This bird-trade seems, moreover,
to have been so profitable to the Spaniards,
then and now the possessors of the isles, that a
government order for the killing or setting at
liberty of all hen canaries, caught with the males,
was issued in order that the breed might be confined
to its native country; a decree not attended
with successful results as regards the intention of
the then ruling powers.</p>

<p>The foreign supply to this country is now principally
from Holland and Germany, where canaries
are reared in great numbers, with that care which
the Dutch in especial bestow upon everything on
which money-making depends, and whence they
are sent or brought over in the spring of every year,
when from nine to twelve months old. Thirty
years ago, the Tyrolese were the principal breeders
and purveyors of canaries for the London market.
From about the era of the peace of 1814, on the
first abdication of Napoleon, for ten or twelve
years they brought over about 2000 birds yearly.
They travelled the whole way on foot, carrying
the birds in cages on their backs, until they
reached whatever port in France or the Netherlands
(as Belgium then was) they might be bound
for. The price of a canary of an average quality was
then from 5<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a fair proportion
were street-sold. At that period, I was told, the
principal open-air sale for canaries (and it is only
of that I now write) was in Whitechapel and
Bethnal-green. All who are familiar with those
localities may smile to think that the birds chirping
and singing in these especially urban places,
were bred for such street-traffic in the valleys of
the Rhætian Alps! I presume that it was the
greater rapidity of communication, and the consequent
diminished cost of carriage, between England,
Holland, and Germany, that caused the
Tyrolese to abandon the trade as one unremunerative&mdash;even
to men who will live on bread,
onions, and water.</p>

<p>I have, perhaps, dwelt somewhat at length on
this portion of the subject, but it is the most
curious portion of all, for the canary is the only
one of all our singing-birds which is <i>solely</i> a
household thing. Linnets, finches, larks, nightingales,
thrushes, and blackbirds, are all free
denizens of the open air, as well as prisoners in
our rooms, but the canary with us is unknown in a
wild state. “Though not very handy,” wrote, in
1848, a very observant naturalist, the late Dr.
Stanley, Bishop of Norwich, “canaries might possibly
be naturalized in our country, by putting
their eggs in the nests of sparrows, chaffinches,
or other similar birds. The experiment has been
partially tried in Berkshire, where a person for
years kept them in an exposed aviary out of doors,
and where they seemed to suffer no inconvenience
from the severest weather.”</p>

<p>The breeding of canaries in this country for the
London supply has greatly increased. They are
bred in Leicester and Norwich, weavers being
generally fond of birds. In London itself, also,
they are bred to a greater extent than used to be
the case, barbers being among the most assiduous
rearers of the canary. A dealer who trades in
both foreign and home-bred birds thought that
the supply from the country, and from the Continent,
was about the same, 8000 to 9000 each,
not including what were sold by the barbers, who
are regarded as “fanciers,” not to say interlopers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by the dealers. No species of birds are ever
bred by the shop-dealers. The price of a brisk
canary is 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i>; but they are sold in the streets
as low as 1<i>s.</i> each, a small cage worth 6<i>d.</i> being
sometimes included. These, however, are hens.
As in the life of a canary there is no transition
from freedom to enthralment, for they are in a
cage in the egg, and all their lives afterwards,
they are subject to a far lower rate of mortality
than other street-sold birds. A sixteenth of the
number above stated as forming the gross supply
are sold in the streets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing enumeration includes all the
singing-birds of street-traffic and street-folk’s
supply. The trade I have thus sketched is certainly
one highly curious. We find that there is
round London a perfect belt of men, employed
from the first blush of a summer’s dawn, through
the heats of noon, in many instances during the
night, and in the chills of winter; and all labouring
to give to city-pent men of humble means one
of the peculiar pleasures of the country&mdash;the song
of the birds. It must not be supposed that I would
intimate that the bird-catcher’s life, as regards his
field and wood pursuits, is one of hardship. On
the contrary, it seems to me to be the very one
which, perhaps unsuspected by himself, is best
suited to his tastes and inclinations. Nor can we
think similar pursuits partake much of hardship
when we find independent men follow them for
mere sport, to be rid of lassitude.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the detail of the birds captured for the
Londoners by no means ends here. I have yet
to describe those which are not songsters, and which
are a staple of street-traffic to a greater degree
than birds of song. Of these my notice may be
brief.</p>

<p>The trade in <i>Sparrows</i> is almost exclusively a
street-trade and, numerically considered, not an
inconsiderable one. They are netted in quantities
in every open place near London, and in many
places in London. It is common enough for a
bird-catcher to obtain leave to catch sparrows
in a wood-yard, a brick-field, or places where
is an open space certain to be frequented by
these bold and familiar birds. The sparrows are
sold in the streets generally at 1<i>d.</i> each, sometimes
halfpenny, and sometimes 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and for no
purpose of enjoyment (as in the case of the cheap
song birds), but merely as playthings for children;
in other words, for creatures wilfully or ignorantly
to be tortured. Strings are tied to their
legs and so they have a certain degree of freedom,
but when they offer to fly away they are checked,
and kept fluttering in the air as a child will flutter
a kite. One man told me that he had sometimes
sold as many as 200 sparrows in the back streets
about Smithfield on a fine Sunday. These birds
are not kept in cages, and so they can only be
bought for a plaything. They oft enough escape
from their persecutors.</p>

<p>But it is not merely for the sport of children
that sparrows are purveyed, but for that of grown
men, or&mdash;as Charles Lamb, if I remember rightly,
qualifies it, when he draws a Pentonville sportsman
with a little shrubbery for his preserve&mdash;for
grown cockneys. The birds for adult recreation
are shot in sparrow-matches; the gentleman
slaughtering the most being, of course, the hero of
a sparrow “<i>battue</i>.” One dealer told me that he
had frequently supplied dozens of sparrows for
these matches, at 2<i>s.</i> the dozen, but they were required
to be fine bold birds! One dealer thought
that during the summer months there were as
many sparrows caught close to and within London
as there were goldfinches in the less urban
districts. These birds are sold direct from the
hands of the catcher, so that it is less easy to
arrive at statistics than when there is the intervention
of dealers who know the extent of
the trade carried on. I was told by several, who
had no desire to exaggerate, that to estimate this
sparrow-sale at 10,000 yearly, sold to children
and idlers in the streets, was too low, but at that
estimate, the outlay, at 1<i>d.</i> a sparrow, would be
850<i>l.</i> The adult sportsmen may slaughter half
that number yearly in addition. The sporting
sparrows are derived from the shopkeepers, who,
when they receive the order, instruct the catchers
to go to work.</p>

<p><i>Starlings</i> used to be sold in very great quantities
in the streets, but the trade is now but the
shadow of its former state. The starling, too, is
far less numerous than it was, and has lost much
of its popularity. It is now seldom seen in flocks
of more than 40, and it is rare to see a flock at
all, although these birds at one period mustered
in congregations of hundreds and even thousands.
Ruins, and the roofs of ancient houses and
barns&mdash;for they love the old and decaying buildings&mdash;were
once covered with them. The starling
was moreover the poor man’s and the peasant’s
parrot. He was taught to speak, and sometimes
to swear. But now the starling, save as regards
his own note, is mute. He is seldom tamed
or domesticated and taught tricks. It is true
starlings may be seen carried on sticks in the
street as if the tamest of the tame, but they are
“braced.” Tapes are passed round their bodies,
and so managed that the bird cannot escape from
the stick, while his fetters are concealed by his
feathers, the street-seller of course objecting to
allow his birds to be handled.</p>

<p>Starlings are caught chiefly Ilford way, I was
told, and about Turnham-green. Some are “rose”
from the nest. The price is from 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> each.
About 3000 are sold annually, half in the streets.
After having been braced, or ill-used, the starling,
if kept as a solitary bird, will often mope and
die.</p>

<p><i>Jackdaws</i> and <i>Magpies</i> are in less demand than
might be expected from their vivacity. Many of
the other birds are supplied the year round, but
daws and pies for only about two months, from the
middle of June to the middle of August. The
price is from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> and about 1000 are thus
disposed of, in equal quantities, one-half in the
streets. These birds are for the most part reared
from the nest, but little pains appear to be taken
with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Redpole</i> is rather a favourite bird among
street-buyers, especially where children are allowed
to choose birds from a stock. I am told
that they most frequently select a goldfinch or a
redpole. These birds are supplied for about two
months. About 800 or 1000 is the extent of the
take. The mortality and prices are the same as
with the goldfinch, but a goldfinch in high song
is worth twice as much as the best redpole.
About a third of the sale of the redpole is in the
streets.</p>

<p>There are also 150 or 200 <i>Black-caps</i> sold annually
in the open air, at from 3<i>d.</i> to 5<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are the chief birds, then, that constitute
the trade of the streets, with the addition of an
occasional yellow-hammer, wren, jay, or even
cuckoo. They also, with the addition of pigeons,
form the stock of the bird-shops.</p>

<p>I have shown the number of birds caught, the
number which survive for sale, and the cost; and,
as usual, under the head of “Statistics,” will be
shown the whole annual expenditure. This, however,
is but a portion of the London outlay on
birds. There is, in addition, the cost of their
cages and of their daily food. The commonest
and smallest cage costs 6<i>d.</i>, a frequent price being
1<i>s.</i> A thrush’s basket-cage cannot be bought,
unless rubbish, under 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I have previously
shown the amount paid for the green food of
birds, and for their turfs, &amp;c., for these are all
branches of street-commerce. Of their other food,
such as rape and canary-seed, German paste,
chopped eggs, biscuit, &amp;c., I need but intimate
the extent by showing what birds will consume,
as it is not a portion of street-trade.</p>

<p>A goldfinch, it has been proved by experimentalising
ornithologists, will consume <i>90</i> grains, in
weight, of canary-seed in 24 hours. A greenfinch,
for whose use 80 grains of wheat were
weighed out, ate 79 of them in 24 hours; and, on
another occasion ate, in the same space of time,
100 grains of a paste of eggs and flour. Sixteen
canaries consumed 100 grains’ weight of food, each
bird, in 24 hours. The amount of provision thus
eaten was about one-sixth of the full weight of
the bird’s body, or an equivalent, were a man to
swallow victuals in the same proportion, of 25 lbs.
in 24 hours. I may remark, moreover, that the
destruction of caterpillars, insects, worms, &amp;c.,
by the small birds, is enormous, especially during
the infancy of their nestlings. A pair of sparrows
fed their brood 36 times an hour for 14 hours
of a long spring day, and, it was calculated, administered
to them in one week 3400 caterpillars.
A pair of chaffinches, also, carried nearly as great
a number of caterpillars for the maintenance of
their young.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The singing-birds sold in the street are offered
either singly in small cages, when the cage is
sold with the bird, or they are displayed in
a little flock in a long cage, the buyer selecting
any he prefers. They always appear lively in
the streets, or indeed a sale would be hopeless,
for no one would buy a dull or sick bird. The
captives are seen to hop and heard to chirp, but
they are not often heard to sing when thus offered
to the public, and it requires some little attention
to judge what is but an impatient flutter, and
what is the fruit of mere hilarity.</p>

<p>The places where the street-sellers more especially
offer their birds are&mdash;Smithfield, Clerkenwell-green,
Lisson-grove, the City and New roads,
Shepherdess-walk, Old Street-road, Shoreditch,
Spitalfields, Whitechapel, Tower-hill, Ratcliffe-highway,
Commercial-road East, Poplar, Billingsgate,
Westminster Broadway, Covent-garden,
Blackfriars-road, Bermondsey (mostly about Dock-head),
and in the neighbourhood of the Borough
Market. The street-sellers are also itinerant,
carrying the birds in cages, holding them up to
tempt the notice of people whom they see at
the windows, or calling at the houses. The sale
used to be very considerable in the “Cut” and
Lambeth-walk. Sometimes the cages with their
inmates are fastened to any contiguous rail; sometimes
they are placed on a bench or stall; and
occasionally in cages on the ground.</p>

<p>To say nothing, in this place, of the rogueries
of the bird-trade, I will proceed to show how the
street-sold birds are frequently inferior to those in
the shops. The catcher, as I have stated, is also
the street-seller. He may reach the Dials, or
whatever quarter the dealer he supplies may reside
in, with perhaps 30 linnets and as many
goldfinches. The dealer selects 24 of each, refusing
the remaining dozen, on account of their
being hens, or hurt, or weakly birds. The man then
resorts to the street to effect a sale of that dozen,
and thus the streets have the refuse of the shops.
On the other hand, however, when the season is at
its height, and the take of birds is the largest, as
at this time of year, the shops are “stocked.”
The cages and recesses are full, and the dealer’s
anxiety is to sell before he purchases more birds.
The catchers proceed in their avocation; they
must dispose of their stock; the shopkeeper will
not buy “at any figure,” and so the streets are
again resorted to, and in this way fine birds are
often sold very cheap. Both these liabilities prevail
the year through, but most in the summer,
and keep up a sort of poise; but I apprehend that
the majority, perhaps the great majority, of the
street-sold birds, are of an inferior sort, but then
the price is much lower. On occasions when the
bird-trade is overdone, the catchers will sell a
few squirrels, or gather snails for the shops.</p>

<p>The buyers of singing-birds are eminently the
working people, along with the class of tradesmen
whose means and disposition are of the
same character as those of the artisan. Grooms
and coachmen are frequently fond of birds;
many are kept in the several mews, and often the
larger singing-birds, such as blackbirds and
thrushes. The fondness of a whole body of
artificers for any particular bird, animal, or flower,
is remarkable. No better instance need be cited
than that of the Spitalfields weavers. In the
days of their prosperity they were the cultivators
of choice tulips, afterwards, though not in so full a
degree, of dahlias, and their pigeons were the
best “fliers” in England. These things were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
accomplished with little cost, comparatively, for
the weavers were engaged in tasks, grateful and
natural to their tastes and habitudes; and what
was expense in the garden or aviary of the rich,
was an exercise of skill and industry on the part
of the silk-weaver. The humanising and even
refining influence of such pursuits is very great,
and as regards these pure pleasures it is not seldom
that the refinement which can appreciate them has
proceeded not to but <i>from</i> the artisans. The operatives
have often been in the van of those who have
led the public taste from delighting in the cruelty
and barbarity of bear and bull-baiting and of
cock-fighting&mdash;among the worst of all possible
schools, and very influential those schools were&mdash;to
the delight in some of the most beautiful works
of nature. It is easy to picture the difference of
mood between a man going home from a dog-fight
at night, or going home from a visit to his flowers,
or from an examination to satisfy himself that his
birds were “all right.” The families of the two
men felt the difference. Many of the rich appear
to remain mere savages in their tastes and sports.
Battues, lion and hippopotamus hunting, &amp;c.,&mdash;all
are mere civilized barbarisms. When shall we
learn, as Wordsworth says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

      <div class="verse">With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the change in Spitalfields is great. Since
the prevalence of low wages the weaver’s garden
has disappeared, and his pigeon-cote, even if its
timbers have not rotted away, is no longer stocked
with carriers, dragoons, horsemen, jacobins, monks,
poulters, turtles, tumblers, fantails, and the many
varieties of what is in itself a variety&mdash;the fancy-pigeon.
A thrush, or a linnet, may still sing to
the clatter of the loom, but that is all. The
culture of the tulip, the dahlia, and (sometimes)
of the fuchsia, was attended, as I have said, with
small cost, still it <i>was</i> cost, and the weaver, as
wages grew lower, could not afford either the outlay
or the loss of time. To cultivate flowers, or
rear doves, so as to make them a means of subsistence,
requires a man’s whole time, and to
such things the Spitalfields man did not devote his
time, but his leisure.</p>

<p>The readers who have perused this work from
its first appearance will have noticed how frequently
I have had to comment on the always
realized indication of good conduct, and of a
superior taste and generally a superior intelligence,
when I have found the rooms of working
people contain flowers and birds. I could adduce
many instances. I have seen and heard birds in
the rooms of tailors, shoemakers, coopers, cabinet-makers,
hatters, dressmakers, curriers, and street-sellers,&mdash;all
people of the best class. One of the
most striking, indeed, was the room of a street-confectioner.
His family attended to the sale of
the sweets, and he was greatly occupied at home
in their manufacture, and worked away at his
peppermint-rock, in the very heart of one of the
thickliest populated parts of London, surrounded
by the song of thrushes, linnets, and goldfinches,
all kept, not for profit, but because he
“loved” to have them about him. I have
seldom met a man who impressed me more
favourably.</p>

<p>The flowers in the room are more attributable
to the superintending taste of a wife or daughter,
and are found in the apartments of the same class
of people.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference between the buyers
or keepers of birds and of dogs in the working
classes, especially when the dog is of a sporting
or “varmint” sort. Such a dog-keeper is often
abroad and so his home becomes neglected; he is
interested about rat-hunts, knows the odds on
or against the dog’s chance to dispatch his rats
in the time allotted, loses much time and customers,
his employers grumbling that the work is
so slowly executed, and so custom or work falls
off. The bird-lover, on the other hand, is generally
a more domestic, and, perhaps consequently,
a more prosperous and contented man. It is
curious to mark the refining qualities of particular
trades. I do not remember seeing a bull-dog
in the possession of any of the Spitalfields
silk-weavers: with them all was flowers and birds.
The same I observed with the tailors and other
kindred occupations. With slaughterers, however,
and drovers, and Billingsgatemen, and coachmen,
and cabmen, whose callings naturally tend to
blunt the sympathy with suffering, the gentler
tastes are comparatively unknown. The dogs are
almost all of the “varmint” kind, kept either for
rat-killing, fighting, or else for their ugliness.
For “pet” or “fancy” dogs they have no feeling,
and in singing birds they find little or no
delight.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Bird-Catchers who are Street-Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>The street-sellers of birds are called by themselves
“hawkers,” and sometimes “bird hawkers.”</p>

<p>Among the bird-catchers I did not hear of any
very prominent characters at present, three of the
best known and most prominent having died
within these ten months. I found among all I
saw the vagrant characteristics I have mentioned,
and often united with a quietness of speech and
manner which might surprise those who do not
know that any pursuit which entails frequent silence,
watchfulness, and solitude, forms such manners.
Perhaps the man most talked of by his fellow-labourers,
was Old Gilham, who died lately.
Gilham was his real name, for among the bird-catchers
there is not that prevalence of nicknames
which I found among the costermongers and
patterers. One reason no doubt is, that these
bird-folk do not meet regularly in the markets.
It is rarely, however, that they know each other’s
surnames, Old Gilham being an exception. It is
Old Tom, or Young Mick, or Jack, or Dick,
among them. I heard of no John or Richard.</p>

<p>For 60 years, almost without intermission, Old
Gilham caught birds. I am assured that to state
that his “catch” during this long period averaged
100 a week, hens included, is within the mark,
for he was a most indefatigable man; even at that
computation, however, he would have been the
captor, in his lifetime, of three hundred and twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thousand birds! A bird-catcher who used sometimes
to start in the morning with Old Gilham,
and walk with him until their roads diverged, told
me that of late years the old man’s talk was a
good deal of where he had captured his birds in
the old times: “‘Why, Ned,’ he would say to me,
proceeded his companion, ‘I’ve catched goldfinches
in lots at Chalk Farm, and all where
there’s that railway smoke and noise just by the
hill (Primrose Hill). I can’t think where they’ll
drive all the birds to by and bye. I dare say
the first time the birds saw a railway with its
smoke, and noise to frighten them, and all the
fire too, they just thought it was the devil was
come.’ He wasn’t a fool, wasn’t old Gilham, sir.
‘Why,’ he’d go on for to say, ‘I’ve laid many a
day at Ball’s Pond there, where it’s nothing but
a lot of houses now, and catched hundreds of
birds. And I’ve catched them where there’s all
them grand squares Pimlico way, and in Britannia
Fields, and at White Condic. What with all
these buildings, and them barbers, I don’t know
what the bird-trade’ll come to. It’s hard for a
poor man to have to go to Finchley for birds that
he could have catched at Holloway once, but
people never thinks of that. When I were young
I could make three times as much as I do now.
I’ve got a pound for a good sound chaffinch as I
brought up myself.’ Ah, poor old Gilham, sir;
I wish you could have seen him, he’d have told
you of some queer changes in his time.”</p>

<p>A shopkeeper informed me that a bird-catcher
had talked to him of even “queerer” changes. This
man died eight or ten years ago at an advanced
age, but beyond the fact of his offering birds occasionally
at my informant’s shop, where he was
known merely as “the old man,” he could tell
me nothing of the ancient bird-catcher, except that
he was very fond of a talk, and used to tell how
he had catched birds between fifty and sixty years,
and had often, when a lad, catched them where
many a dock in London now stands. “Where
there’s many a big ship now in deep water, I’ve
catched flocks of birds. I never catched birds
to be sure at them docks,” he would add, “as was
dug out of the houses. Why, master, you’ll remember
their pulling down St. Katherine’s Church,
and all them rummy streets the t’other side of the
Tower, for a dock.” As I find that the first dock
constructed on the north side of the Thames,
the West India dock, was not commenced until
the year 1800, there seems no reason to discredit
the bird-catcher’s statement. Among
other classes of street-sellers I have had to remark
the little observation they extended to the changes
all around, such as the extension of street-traffic
to miles and miles of suburbs, unknown till recently.
Two thousand miles of houses have been
built in London within the last 20 years. But
with the bird-catchers this want of observance is
not so marked. Of necessity they must notice
the changes which have added to the fatigues and
difficulties of their calling, by compelling them,
literally, to “go further a-field.”</p>

<p>A young man, rather tall, and evidently active,
but very thin, gave me the following account. His
manners were quiet and his voice low. His dress
could not so well be called mean as hard worn,
with the unmistakable look of much of the attire
of his class, that it was not made for the wearer;
his surtout, for instance, which was fastened in
front by two buttons, reached down to his ancles,
and could have inclosed a bigger man. He resided
in St. Luke’s, in which parish there are more bird-catchers
living than in any other. The furniture
of his room was very simple. A heavy old sofa,
in the well of which was a bed, a table, two chairs,
a fender, a small closet containing a few pots and
tins, and some twenty empty bird-cages of different
sizes hung against the walls. In a sort of wooden
loft, which had originally been constructed, he
believed, for the breeding of fancy-pigeons, and
which was erected on the roof, were about a dozen
or two of cages, some old and broken, and in
them a few live goldfinches, which hopped about
very merrily. They were all this year’s birds,
and my informant, who had “a little connection
of his own,” was rearing them in hopes
they would turn out good specs, quite “birds
beyond the run of the streets.” The place and
the cages, each bird having its own little cage,
were very clean, but at the time of my visit
the loft was exceedingly hot, as the day was one
of the sultriest. Lest this heat should prove too
great for the finches, the timbers on all sides were
well wetted and re-wetted at intervals, for about
an hour at noon, at which time only was the sun
full on the loft.</p>

<p>“I shall soon have more birds, sir,” he said,
“but you see I only put aside here such as are
the very best of the take; all cocks, of course. O,
I’ve been in the trade all my life; I’ve had a
turn at other things, certainly, but this life suits
me best, I think, because I have my health best
in it. My father&mdash;he’s been dead a goodish bit&mdash;was
a bird-catcher as well, and he used to take
me out with him as soon as I was strong enough;
when I was about ten, I suppose. I don’t remember
my mother. Father was brought up to
brick-making. I believe that most of the bird-catchers
that have been trades, and that’s not
half a quarter perhaps, were brick-makers, or
something that way. Well, I don’t know the
reason. The brick-making was, in my father’s
young days, carried on more in the country, and
the bird-catchers used to fall in with the brick-makers,
and so perhaps that led to it. I’ve heard
my father tell of an old soldier that had been discharged
with a pension being the luckiest bird-catcher
he knowed. The soldier was a catcher before
he first listed, and he listed drunk. I once&mdash;yes,
sir, I dare say that’s fifteen year back, for I
was quite a lad&mdash;walked with my father and captain”
(the pensioner’s sobriquet) “till they parted
for work, and I remember very well I heard him tell
how, when on march in Portingal&mdash;I think that’s
what he called it, but it’s in foreign parts&mdash;he saw
flocks of birds; he wished he could be after catching
them, for he was well tired of sogering. I was
sent to school twice or thrice, and can read a little
and write a little; and I should like reading better
if I could manage it better. I read a penny number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
or the ‘police’ in a newspaper, now and then, but
very seldom. But on a fine day I hated being at
school. I wanted to be at work, to make something
at bird-catching. If a boy can make money,
why shouldn’t he? And if I’d had a net, or
cage, and a mule of my own, then, I thought, I
could make money.” [I may observe that the
mule longed for by my informant was a “cross”
between two birds, and was wanted for
the decoy. Some bird-catchers contend that a
mule makes the best call-bird of any; others
that the natural note of a linnet, for instance,
was more alluring than the song of a mule between
a linnet and a goldfinch. One birdman
told me that the excellence of a mule was, that
it had been bred and taught by its master, had
never been at large, and was “better to manage;”
it was bolder, too, in a cage, and its notes were
often loud and ringing, and might be heard to a
considerable distance.]</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stick to school, sir,” my informant
continued, “and I don’t know why, lest it be that
one man’s best suited for one business, and another
for another. That may be seen every day. I was
sent on trial to a shoemaker, and after that to a
ropemaker, for father didn’t seem to like my
growing up and being a bird-catcher, like he was.
But I never felt well, and knew I should never be
any great hand at them trades, and so when my
poor father went off rather sudden, I took to the
catching at once and had all his traps. Perhaps,
but I can’t say to a niceness, that was eleven
year back. Do I like the business, do you say,
sir? Well, I’m forced to like it, for I’ve no
other to live by.” [The reader will have remarked
how this man attributed the course he pursued,
evidently from natural inclination, to its being
the best and most healthful means of subsistence
in his power.] “Last Monday, for my
dealers like birds on a Monday or Tuesday
best, and then they’ve the week before them,&mdash;I
went to catch in the fields this side of Barnet, and
started before two in the morning, when it was
neither light nor dark. You must get to your
place before daylight to be ready for the first
flight, and have time to lay your net properly.
When I’d done that, I lay down and smoked.
No, smoke don’t scare the birds; I think they’re
rather drawn to notice anything new, if all’s quite
quiet. Well, the first pull I had about 90 birds,
nearly all linnets. There was, as well as I can
remember, three hedge-sparrows among them, and
two larks, and one or two other birds. Yes,
there’s always a terrible flutter and row when
you make a catch, and often regular fights in the
net. I then sorted my birds, and let the hens go,
for I didn’t want to be bothered with them. I
might let such a thing as 35 hens go out of rather
more than an 80 take, for I’ve always found,
in catching young broods, that I’ve drawn more
cocks than hens. How do I know the difference
when the birds are so young? As easy as light
from dark. You must lift up the wing, quite
tender, and you’ll find that a cock linnet has
black, or nearly black, feathers on his shoulder,
where the hens are a deal lighter. Then the cock
has a broader and whiter stripe on the wing than
the hen has. It’s quite easy to distinguish, quite.
A cock goldfinch is straighter and more larger in
general than a hen, and has a broader white on
his wing, as the cock linnet has; he’s black round
the beak and the eye too, and a hen’s greenish
thereabouts. There’s some gray-pates (young
birds) would deceive any one until he opens their
wings. Well, I went on, sir, until about one
o’clock, or a little after, as well as I could tell from
the sun, and then came away with about 100
singing birds. I sold them in the lump to three
shopkeepers at 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dozen.
That was a good day, sir; a very lucky day. I
got about 17<i>s.</i>, the best I ever did but once, when
I made 19<i>s.</i> in a day.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s hard work is mine, because there’s
such a long walking home when you’ve done
catching. O, when you’re at work it’s not work
but almost a pleasure. I’ve laid for hours though,
without a catch. I smoke to pass the time when
I’m watching; sometimes I read a bit if I’ve
had anything to take with me to read; then at
other times I thinks. If you don’t get a catch
for hours, it’s only like an angler without a nibble.
O, I don’t know what I think about; about
nothing, perhaps. Yes, I’ve had a friend or two
go out catching with me just for the amusement.
They must lie about and wait as I do. We have
a little talk of course: well, perhaps about sporting;
no, not horse-racing, I care nothing for that,
but it’s hardly business taking any one with you.
I supply the dealers and hawk as well. Perhaps
I make 12<i>s.</i> a week the year through. Some
weeks I’ve made between 3<i>l.</i> and 4<i>l.</i>, and in
winter, when there’s rain every day, perhaps I
haven’t cleared a penny in a fortnight. That’s
the worst of it. But I make more than others
because I have a connection and raise good birds.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I’m stopped by the farmers when
I’m at work, but not often, though there is some
of ’em very obstinate. It’s no use, for if a catcher’s
net has to be taken from one part of a farm,
after he’s had the trouble of laying it, why it must
be laid in another part. Some country people likes
to have their birds catched.”</p>

<p>My informant supplied shopkeepers and
hawked his birds in the streets and to the houses.
He had a connection, he said, and could generally
get through them, but he had sometimes put a
bird or two in a fancy house. These are the public-houses
resorted to by “the fancy,” in some of
which may be seen two or three dozen singing-birds
for sale on commission, through the agency
of the landlord or the waiter. They are the property
of hawkers or dealers, and must be good
birds, or they will not be admitted.</p>

<p>The number of birds caught, and the proportion
sold in the streets, I have already stated.
The number of bird-catchers, I may repeat, is
about the same as that of street bird-sellers, 200.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Crippled Street Bird-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>From the bird-seller whose portrait will be given
in the next number of this work I have received
the following account. The statement previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
given was that of a catcher and street-seller, as
are the great majority in the trade; the following
narrative is that of one who, from his infirmities,
is merely a street-<i>seller</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The poor man’s deformity may be best understood
by describing it in his own words: “I
have no ancle.” His right leg is emaciated, the
bone is smaller than that of his other leg (which
is not deformed), and there is no ancle joint.
The joints of the wrists and shoulders are also
defective, though not utterly wanting, as in the
ancle. In walking this poor cripple seems to
advance by means of a series of jerks. He uses
his deformed leg, but must tread, or rather support
his body, on the ball of the misformed foot,
while he advances his sound leg; then, with a
twist of his body, after he has advanced and
stands upon his undeformed leg and foot, he
throws forward the crippled part of his frame
by the jerk I have spoken of. His arms are
usually pressed against his ribs as he walks,
and convey to a spectator the notion that he is
unable to raise them from that position. This,
however, is not the case; he can raise them, not
as a sound man does, but with an effort and a
contortion of his body to humour the effort. His
speech is also defective, his words being brought
out, as it were, by jerks; he has to prepare himself,
and to throw up his chin, in order to converse,
and then he speaks with difficulty. His
face is sun-burnt and healthy-looking. His dress
was a fustian coat with full skirts, cloth trowsers
somewhat patched, and a clean coarse shirt. His
right shoe was suited to his deformity, and was
strapped with a sort of leather belt round the
lower part of the leg.</p>

<p>A considerable number of book-stall keepers,
as well as costermongers, swag-barrowmen, ginger-beer
and lemonade sellers, orange-women, sweet-stuff
vendors, root-sellers, and others, have established
their pitches&mdash;some of them having stalls
with a cover, like a roof&mdash;from Whitechapel workhouse
to the Mile End turnpike-gate; near the
gate they are congregated most thickly, and there
they are mixed with persons seated on the forms
belonging to adjacent innkeepers, which are placed
there to allow any one to have his beer and
tobacco in the open air. Among these street-sellers
and beer-drinkers is seated the crippled
bird-seller, generally motionless.</p>

<p>His home is near the Jews’ burial-ground, and
in one of the many “places” which by a misnomer,
occasioned by the change in the character
and appearance of what <i>were</i> the outskirts, are
still called “Pleasant.” On seeking him here, I
had some little difficulty in finding the house, and
asking a string of men, who were chopping fire-wood
in an adjoining court, for the man I wanted,
mentioning his name, no one knew anything
about him; though when I spoke of his calling,
“O,” they said, “you want Old Billy.” I then
found Billy at his accustomed pitch, with a very
small stock of birds in two large cages on the
ground beside him, and he accompanied me to his
residence. The room in which we sat had a pile
of fire-wood opposite the door; the iron of the
upper part of the door-latch being wanting was
replaced by a piece of wood&mdash;and on the pile sat
a tame jackdaw, with the inquisitive and askant
look peculiar to the bird. Above the pile was a
large cage, containing a jay&mdash;a bird seldom sold
in the streets now&mdash;and a thrush, in different
compartments. A table, three chairs, and a hamper
or two used in the wood-cutting, completed
the furniture. Outside the house were cages containing
larks, goldfinches, and a very fine starling,
of whose promising abilities the bird-seller’s sister
had so favourable an opinion that she intended to
try and teach it to talk, although that was very
seldom done now.</p>

<p>The following is the statement I obtained from
the poor fellow. The man’s sister was present at
his desire, as he was afraid I could not understand
him, owing to the indistinctness of his speech;
but that was easy enough, after awhile, with a
little patience and attention.</p>

<p>“I was born a cripple, sir,” he said, “and I
shall die one. I was born at Lewisham, but I
don’t remember living in any place but London.
I remember being at Stroud though, where my
father had taken me, and bathed me often in the
sea himself, thinking it might do me good. I’ve
heard him say, too, that when I was very young
he took me to almost every hospital in London,
but it was of no use. My father and mother
were as kind to me and as good parents as could
be. He’s been dead nineteen years, and my
mother died before him. Father was very poor,
almost as poor as I am. He worked in a brick-field,
but work weren’t regular. I couldn’t walk
at all until I was six years old, and I was between
nine and ten before I could get up and down
stairs by myself. I used to slide down before, as
well as I could, and had to be carried up. When
I could get about and went among other boys, I
was in great distress, I was teased so. Life was
a burthen to me, as I’ve read something about.
They used to taunt me by offering to jump me” (invite
him to a jumping match), “and to say, I’ll run
you a race on one leg. They were bad to me then,
and they are now. I’ve sometimes sat down and
cried, but not often. No, sir, I can’t say that I ever
wished I was dead. I hardly know why I cried.
I suppose because I was miserable. I learned to
read at a Sunday school, where I went a long time.
I like reading. I read the Bible and tracts, nothing
else; never a newspaper. It don’t come in
my way, and if it did I shouldn’t look at it, for I
can’t read over well and it’s nothing to me who’s
king or who’s queen. It can never have anything
to do with me. It don’t take my attention.
There’ll be no change for me in this world. When
I was thirteen my father put me into the bird
trade. He knew a good many catchers. I’ve been
bird-selling in the streets for six-and-twenty years
and more, for I was 39 the 24th of last January.
Father didn’t know what better he could put me
to, as I hadn’t the right use of my hands or feet,
and at first I did very well. I liked the birds
and do still. I used to think at first that they
was like me; they was prisoners, and I was a
cripple. At first I sold birds in Poplar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Limehouse, and Blackwall, and was a help to my
parents, for I cleared 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i> every week. But
now, oh dear, I don’t know where all the money’s
gone to. I think there’s very little left in the
country. I’ve sold larks, linnets, and goldfinches,
to captains of ships to take to the West Indies.
I’ve sold them, too, to go to Port Philip. O, and
almost all those foreign parts. They bring foreign
birds here, and take back London birds. I don’t
know anything about foreign birds. I know
there’s men dressed as sailors going about selling
them; they’re duffers&mdash;I mean the men. There’s
a neighbour of mine, that’s very likely never been
20 miles out of London, and when he hawks
birds he always dresses like a countryman, and
duffs that way.</p>

<p>“When my father died,” continued the man,
“I was completely upset; everything in the world
was upset. I was forced to go into the workhouse,
and I was there between four and five months.
O, I hated it. I’d rather live on a penny loaf a
day than be in it again. I’ve never been near
the parish since, though I’ve often had nothing to
eat many a day. I’d rather be lamer than I am,
and be oftener called silly Billy&mdash;and that sometimes
makes me dreadful wild&mdash;than be in the
workhouse. It was starvation, but then I know
I’m a hearty eater, very hearty. Just now I
know I could eat a shilling plate of meat, but for
all that I very seldom taste meat. I live on bread
and butter and tea, sometimes bread without
butter. When I have it I eat a quartern loaf at
three meals. It depends upon how I’m off. My
health’s good. I never feel in any pain now; I
did when I first got to walk, in great pain. Beer
I often don’t taste once in two or three months,
and this very hot weather one can’t help longing
for a drop, when you see people drinking it all
sides of you, but they have the use of their limbs.”
[Here two little girls and a boy rushed into the
room, for they had but to open the door from the
outside, and, evidently to tease the poor fellow,
loudly demanded “a ha’penny bird.” When the
sister had driven them away, my informant continued.]
“I’m still greatly teased, sir, with
children; yes, and with men too, both when
they’re drunk and sober. I think grown persons
are the worst. They swear and use bad language
to me. I’m sure I don’t know why. I know
no name they call me by in particular when I’m
teased, if it isn’t ‘Old Hypocrite.’ I can’t say
why they call me ‘hypocrite.’ I suppose because
they know no better. Yes, I think I’m religious,
rather. I would be more so, if I had clothes. I
get to chapel sometimes.” [A resident near the
bird-seller’s pitch, with whom I had some conversation,
told me of “Billy” being sometimes teased
in the way described. Some years ago, he believed
it was at Limehouse, my informant heard a gentlemanly-looking
man, tipsy, <span class="lock">d&mdash;n</span> the street bird-seller
for Mr. <i>Hobbler</i>, and bid him go to the
Mansion House, or to <span class="lock">h&mdash;l</span>. I asked the cripple
about this, but he had no recollection of it; and, as
he evidently did not understand the allusion to
Mr. Hobbler, I was not surprised at his forgetfulness.]</p>

<p>“I like to sit out in the sunshine selling my
birds,” he said. “If it’s rainy, and I can’t go out,
because it would be of no use, I’m moped to death.
I stay at home and read a little; or I chop a little
fire-wood, but you may be very sure, sir, its little
I can do that way. I never associate with the
neighbours. I never had any pleasure, such as
going to a fair, or like that. I don’t remember
having ever spent a penny in a place of amusement
in my life. Yes, I’ve often sat all day in
the sun, and of course a deal of thoughts goes
through my head. I think, shall I be able to
afford myself plenty of bread when I get home?
And I think of the next world sometimes, and feel
quite sure, quite, that I shan’t be a cripple there.
Yes, that’s a comfort, for this world will never
be any good to me. I feel that I shall be a poor
starving cripple, till I end, perhaps, in the workhouse.
Other poor men can get married, but not
such as me. But I never was in love in my life,
never.” [Among the vagrants and beggars, I
may observe, there are men more terribly deformed
than the bird-seller, who are married, or living in
concubinage.] “Yes, sir,” he proceeded, “I’m
quite reconciled to my lameness, quite; and have
been for years. O, no, I never fret about that
now; but about starving, perhaps, and the workhouse.</p>

<p>“Before father died, the parish allowed us 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
and a quartern loaf a week; but after he was buried,
they’d allow me nothing; they’d only admit me
into the house. I hadn’t a penny allowed to me
when I discharged myself and came out. I hardly
know how ever I <i>did</i> manage to get a start again
with the birds. I knew a good many catchers,
and they trusted me. Yes, they was all poor
men. I did pretty tidy by bits, but only when it
was fine weather, until these five years or so,
when things got terrible bad. Particularly just the
two last years with me. Do you think times are
likely to mend, sir, with poor people? If working-men
had only money, they’d buy innocent
things like birds to amuse them at home; but if
they can’t get the money, as I’ve heard them say
when they’ve been pricing my stock, why in
course they can’t spend it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the sister, “trade’s very
bad. Where my husband and I once earned 18<i>s.</i>
at the fire-wood, and then 15<i>s.</i>, we can’t now
earn 12<i>s.</i> the two of us, slave as hard as we will. I
always dread the winter a-coming. Though there
may be more fire-wood wanted, there’s greater expenses,
and it’s a terrible time for such as us.”</p>

<p>“I dream sometimes, sir,” the cripple resumed
in answer to my question, “but not often. I
often have more than once dreamed I was starving
and dying of hunger. I remember that, for I
woke in a tremble. But most dreams is soon
forgot. I’ve never seemed to myself to be a
cripple in my dreams. Well, I can’t explain how,
but I feel as if my limbs was all free like&mdash;so
beautiful. I dream most about starving
I think, than about anything else. Perhaps
that’s when I have to go to sleep hungry. I
sleep very well, though, take it altogether. If I
had only plenty to live upon there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
nobody happier. I’m happy enough when times
is middling with me, only one feels it won’t last.
I like a joke as well as anybody when times is
good; but that’s been very seldom lately.</p>

<p>“It’s all small birds I sell in the street now,
except at a very odd time. That jackdaw there,
sir, he’s a very fine bird. I’ve tamed him myself,
and he’s as tame as a dog. My sister’s a
very good hand among birds, and helps me. She
once taught a linnet to say ‘Joey’ as plain as you
can speak it yourself, sir. I buy birds of different
catchers, but haven’t money to buy the better
kinds, as I have to sell at 3<i>d.</i>, and 4<i>d.</i>, and 6<i>d.</i>
mostly. If I had a pound to lay out in a few
nice cages and good birds, I think I could do
middling, this fine weather particler, for I’m a
very good judge of birds, and know how to
manage them as well as anybody. Then birds is
rather dearer to buy than they was when I was
first in the trade. The catchers have to go further,
and I’m afeared the birds is getting scarcer, and
so there’s more time taken up. I buy of several
catchers. The last whole day that I was at my
pitch I sold nine birds, and took about 3<i>s.</i> If I
could buy birds ever so cheap, there’s always
such losses by their dying. I’ve had three parts
of my young linnets die, do what I might, but
not often so many. Then if they die all the food
they’ve had is lost. There goes all for nothing
the rape and flax-seed for your linnets, canary and
flax for your goldfinches, chopped eggs for your
nightingales, and German paste for your sky-larks.
I’ve made my own German paste when I’ve
wanted a sufficient quantity. It’s made of pea-meal,
treacle, hog’s-lard, and moss-seed. I sell
more goldfinches than anything else. I used to
sell a good many sparrows for shooting, but I
haven’t done anything that way these eight or
nine years. It’s a fash’nable sport still, I hear.
I’ve reared nightingales that sung beautiful, and
have sold them at 4<i>s.</i> a piece, which was very
cheap. They often die when the time for their
departure comes. A shopkeeper as supplied such
as I’ve sold would have charged 1<i>l.</i> a piece for
them. One of my favouritest birds is redpoles,
but they’re only sold in the season. I think it’s
one of the most knowingest little birds that is;
more knowing than the goldfinch, in my opinion.</p>

<p>“My customers are all working people, all of
them. I sell to nobody else; I make 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i>;
I call 5<i>s.</i> a good week at this time of year, when
the weather suits. I lodge with a married sister;
her husband’s a wood-chopper, and I pay 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week, which is cheap, for I’ve no sticks of my
own. If I earn 4<i>s.</i> there’s only 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> left to
live on the week through. In winter, when I can
make next to nothing, and must keep my birds,
it is terrible&mdash;oh yes, sir, if you believe me, terrible!”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Tricks of the Bird-Duffers.</span></h3>

<p>The tricks practised by the bird-sellers are frequent
and systematic. The other day a man connected
with the bird-trade had to visit Holloway, the
City, and Bermondsey. In Holloway he saw six
men, some of whom he recognised as regular bird-catchers
and street-sellers, offering sham birds; in
the City he found twelve; and in Bermondsey
six, as well as he could depend upon his memory.
These, he thought, did not constitute more than
a half of the number now at work as bird-“duffers,”
not including the sellers of foreign birds.
In the summer, indeed, the duffers are most
numerous, for birds are cheapest then, and these
tricksters, to economise time, I presume, buy of
other catchers any cheap hens suited to their purpose.
Some of them, I am told, never catch their
birds at all, but purchase them.</p>

<p>The greenfinch is the bird on which these men’s
art is most commonly practised, its light-coloured
plumage suiting it to their purposes. I have heard
these people styled “bird-swindlers,” but by street-traders
I heard them called “bird-duffers,” yet there
appears to be no very distinctive name for them.
They are nearly all men, as is the case in the bird
trade generally, although the wives may occasionally
assist in the street-sale. The means of deception,
as regards the greenfinch especially, are from paint.
One aim of these artists is to make their finch resemble
some curious foreign bird, “not often to
be sold so cheap, or to be sold at all in this
country.” They study the birds in the window of
the naturalists’ shops for this purpose. Sometimes
they declare these painted birds are young Java
sparrows (at one time “a fashionable bird”), or
St. Helena birds, or French or Italian finches.
They sometimes get 5<i>s.</i> for such a “duffing bird;”
one man has been known to boast that he once got
a sovereign. I am told, however, by a bird-catcher
who had himself supplied birds to these
men for duffing, that they complained of the trade
growing worse and worse.</p>

<p>It is usually a hen which is painted, for the hen
is by far the cheapest purchase, and while the
poor thing is being offered for sale by the duffers,
she has an unlimited supply of hemp-seed, without
other food, and hemp-seed beyond a proper
quantity, is a very strong stimulus. This makes
the hen look brisk and bold, but if newly caught,
as is usually the case, she will perhaps be found
dead next morning. The duffer will object to his
bird being handled on account of its timidity;
“but it is timid only with strangers!” “When
you’ve had him a week, ma’am,” such a bird-seller
will say, “you’ll find him as lovesome and
tame as can be.” One jealous lady, when asked
5<i>s.</i> for a “very fine Italian finch, an excellent
singer,” refused to buy, but offered a deposit of
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, if the man would leave his bird and cage,
for the trial of the bird’s song, for two or three
days. The duffer agreed; and was bold enough
to call on the third day to hear the result. The
bird was dead, and after murmuring a little at the
lady’s mismanagement, and at the loss he had
been subjected to, the man brought away his cage.
He boasted of this to a dealer’s assistant who
mentioned it to me, and expressed his conviction
that it was true enough. The paints used for the
transformation of native birds into foreign are
bought at the colour-shops, and applied with
camel-hair brushes in the usual way.</p>

<p>When canaries are “a bad colour,” or have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
grown a paler yellow from age, they are re-dyed,
by the application of a colour sold at the colour-shops,
and known as “the Queen’s yellow.” Blackbirds
are dyed a deeper black, the “grit” off a
frying-pan being used for the purpose. The same
thing is done to heighten the gloss and blackness
of a jackdaw, I was told, by a man who acknowledged
he had duffed a little; “people liked a gay
bright colour.” In the same way the tints of the
goldfinch are heightened by the application of
paint. It is common enough, moreover, for a man
to paint the beaks and legs of the birds. It is
chiefly the smaller birds which are thus made the
means of cheating.</p>

<p>Almost all the “duffing birds” are hawked. If
a young hen be passed off for a good singing bird,
without being painted, as a cock in his second
singing year, she is “brisked up” with hemp-seed,
is half tipsy in fact, and so passed off deceitfully.
As it is very rarely that even the male birds will
sing in the streets, this is often a successful ruse,
the bird appearing so lively.</p>

<p>A dealer calculated for me, from his own knowledge,
that 2000 small birds were “duffed” yearly,
at an average of from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>As yet I have only spoken of the “duffing” of
English birds, but similar tricks are practised with
the foreign birds.</p>

<p>In parrot-selling there is a good deal of “duffing.”
The birds are “painted up,” as I have described in
the case of the greenfinches, &amp;c. Varnish is also used
to render the colours brighter; the legs and beak
are frequently varnished. Sometimes a spot of red
is introduced, for as one of these duffers observed
to a dealer in English birds, “the more outlandish
you make them look, the better’s the chance to
sell.” Sometimes there is little injury done by
this paint and varnish, which disappear gradually
when the parrot is in the cage of a purchaser;
but in some instances when the bird picks himself
where he has been painted, he dies from the
deleterious compound. Of this mortality, however,
there is nothing approaching that among the
duffed small birds.</p>

<p>Occasionally the duffers carry really fine cockatoos,
&amp;c., and if they can obtain admittance into a
lady’s house, to display the beauty of the bird,
they will pretend to be in possession of smuggled
silk, &amp;c., made of course for duffing purposes.
The bird-duffers are usually dressed as seamen,
and sometimes pretend they must sell the bird
before the ship sails, for a parting spree, or to get
the poor thing a good home. This trade, however,
has from all that I can learn, and in the words of an
informant, “seen its best days.” There are now
sometimes six men thus engaged; sometimes
none: and when one of these men is “hard up,”
he finds it difficult to start again in a business for
which a capital of about 1<i>l.</i> is necessary, as a cage
is wanted generally. The duffers buy the very
lowest priced birds, and have been known to get
2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for what cost but 8<i>s.</i>, but that is a very
rare occurrence, and the men are very poor, and
perhaps more dissipated than the generality of
street-sellers. Parrot duffing, moreover, is seldom
carried on regularly by any one, for he will often
duff cigars and other things in preference, or perhaps
vend really smuggled and good cigars or
tobacco. Perhaps 150 parrots, paroquets, or cockatoos,
are sold in this way annually, at from 15<i>s.</i>
to 1<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> each, but hardly averaging 1<i>l.</i>, as the
duffer will sell, or raffle, the bird for a small sum
if he cannot dispose of it otherwise.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Foreign Birds.</span></h3>

<p>This trade is curious, but far from extensive as
regards street-sale. There is, moreover, contrary
to what might be expected, a good deal of “duffing”
about it. The “duffer” in English birds
disguises them so that they shall look like foreigners;
the duffer in what are unquestionably foreign
birds disguises them that they may look <i>more</i>
foreign&mdash;more Indian than in the Indies.</p>

<p>The word “Duffer,” I may mention, appears
to be connected with the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Durffen</i>, to want,
to be needy, and so to mean literally a needy or
indigent man, even as the word <i>Pedlar</i> has the
same origin&mdash;being derived from the German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bettler</i>, and the Dutch <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Bedelaar</i>&mdash;a beggar. The
verb <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Durffen</i>, means also to dare, to be so bold as
to do; hence, to <i>Durff</i>, or <i>Duff</i>, would signify to
resort to any impudent trick.</p>

<p>The supply of parrots, paroquets, cockatoos,
Java sparrows, or St. Helena birds, is not in the
regular way of consignment from a merchant
abroad to one in London. The commanders and
mates of merchant vessels bring over large quantities;
and often enough the seamen are allowed
to bring parrots or cockatoos in the homeward-bound
ship from the Indies or the African coast,
or from other tropical countries, either to beguile
the tedium of the voyage, for presents to their
friends, or, as in some cases, for sale on their
reaching an English port. More, I am assured,
although statistics are hardly possible on such a
subject, are brought to London, and perhaps by
one-third, than to all the other ports of Great
Britain collectively. Even on board the vessels
of the royal navy, the importation of parrots used
to be allowed as a sort of boon to the seamen. I
was told by an old naval officer that once, after a
long detention on the west coast of Africa, his
ship was ordered home, and, as an acknowledgment
of the good behaviour of his men, he permitted
them to bring parrots, cockatoos, or any
foreign birds, home with them, not limiting the
number, but of course under the inspection of the
petty officers, that there might be no violation of
the cleanliness which always distinguishes a vessel
of war. Along the African coast, to the southward
of Sierra Leone, the men were not allowed to
land, both on account of the unhealthiness of the
shores, and of the surf, which rendered landing
highly dangerous, a danger, however, which the
seamen would not have scrupled to brave, and
recklessly enough, for any impulse of the minute.
As if by instinct, however, the natives seemed to
know what was wanted, for they came off from
the shores in their light canoes, which danced like
feathers on the surf, and brought boat-loads of
birds; these the seamen bought of them, or possessed
themselves of in the way of barter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the ship took her final departure, however,
she was reported as utterly uninhabitable
below, from the incessant din and clamour: “We
might as well have a pack of women aboard, sir,”
was the ungallant remark of one of the petty
officers to his commander. Orders were then
given that the parrots, &amp;c., should be “thinned,”
so that there might not be such an unceasing noise.
This was accordingly done. How many were set
at liberty and made for the shore&mdash;for the seamen
in this instance did not kill them for their skins,
as is not unfrequently the case&mdash;the commander
did not know. He could but conjecture; and he
conjectured that something like a thousand were
released; and even after that, and after the mortality
which takes place among these birds in the
course of a long voyage, a very great number
were brought to Plymouth. Of these, again, a
great number were sent or conveyed under the
care of the sailors to London, when the ship was
paid off. The same officer endeavoured on this
voyage to bring home some very large pine-apples,
which flavoured, and most deliciously, parts of the
ship when she had been a long time at sea; but every
one of them rotted, and had to be thrown overboard.
He fell into the error, Captain &mdash;&mdash; said,
of having the finest fruit selected for the experiment;
an error which the Bahama merchants
had avoided, and consequently they succeeded
where he failed. How the sailors fed the parrots,
my informant could hardly guess, but they brought
a number of very fine birds to England, some of
them with well-cultivated powers of speech.</p>

<p>This, as I shall show, is one of the ways by
which the London supply of parrots, &amp;c., is obtained;
but the permission, as to the importation
of these brightly-feathered birds, is, I understand,
rarely allowed at present to the seamen in the
royal navy. The far greater supply, indeed more
than 90 per cent. of the whole of the birds imported,
is from the merchant-service. I have already
stated, on the very best authority, the
motives which induce merchant-seamen to bring
over parrots and cockatoos. That to bring them
over is an inducement to some to engage in an
African voyage is shown by the following statement,
which was made to me, in the course of a
long inquiry, published in my letters in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, concerning the condition of
the merchant-seamen.</p>

<p>“I would never go to that African coast again,
only I make a pound or two in birds. We buy
parrots, gray parrots chiefly, of the natives, who
come aboard in their canoes. We sometimes pay
6<i>s.</i> or 7<i>s.</i>, in Africa, for a fine bird. I have
known 200 parrots on board; they make a
precious noise; but half the birds die before they
get to England. Some captains won’t allow
parrots.”</p>

<p>When the seamen have settled themselves after
landing in England, they perhaps find that there is
no room in their boarding-houses for their parrots;
these birds are not admitted into the Sailors’ Home;
the seamen’s friends are stocked with the birds,
and look upon another parrot as but another
intruder, an unwelcome pensioner. There remains
but one course&mdash;to sell the birds, and they are
generally sold to a highly respectable man, Mr.
M. Samuel, of Upper East Smithfield; and it is from
him, though not always directly, that the shopkeepers
and street-sellers derive their stock-in-trade.
There is also a further motive for the disposal
of parrots, paroquets, and cockatoos to a
merchant. The seafaring owner of those really
magnificent birds, perhaps, squanders his money,
perhaps he gets “skinned” (stripped of his clothes
and money from being hocussed, or tempted to
helpless drunkenness), or he chooses to sell them,
and he or his boarding-house keeper takes the birds
to Mr. Samuel, and sells them for what he can
get; but I heard from three very intelligent seamen
whom I met with in the course of my inquiry,
and by mere chance, that Mr. Samuel’s price was
fair and his money sure, considering everything,
for there is usually a qualification to every praise.
It is certainly surprising, under these circumstances,
that such numbers of these birds should thus be
disposed of.</p>

<p>Parrots are as gladly, or more gladly, got rid of,
in any manner, in different regions in the continents
of Asia and America, than with us are even
rats from a granary. Dr. Stanley, after speaking
of the beauty of a flight of parrots, says:&mdash;“The
husbandman who sees them hastening through
the air, with loud and impatient screams, looks
upon them with dismay and detestation, knowing
that the produce of his labour and industry is in
jeopardy, when visited by such a voracious multitude
of pilferers, who, like the locusts of Egypt,
desolate whole tracts of country by their unsparing
ravages.” A contrast with their harmlessness, in a
gilded cage in the houses of the wealthy, with us!
The destructiveness of these birds, is then, one
reason why seamen can obtain them so readily and
cheaply, for the natives take pleasure in catching
them; while as to plentifulness, the tropical regions
teem with bird, as with insect and reptile,
life.</p>

<p>Of parrots, paroquets, and cockatoos, there are
3000 imported to London in the way I have described,
and in about equal proportions. They
are sold, wholesale, from 5<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>There are now only three men selling these
brilliant birds regularly in the streets, and in the
fair way of trade; but there are sometimes as
many as 18 so engaged. The price given by a
hawker for a cockatoo, &amp;c., is 8<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>, and
they are retailed at from 15<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i>, or more, “if
it can be got.” The purchasers are the wealthier
classes who can afford to indulge their tastes. Of
late years, however, I am told, a parrot or a
cockatoo seems to be considered indispensable to
an inn (not a gin-palace), and the innkeepers have
been among the best customers of the street parrot-sellers.
In the neighbourhood of the docks, and
indeed along the whole river side below London-bridge,
it is almost impossible for a street-seller to
dispose of a parrot to an innkeeper, or indeed to
any one, as they are supplied by the seamen. A
parrot which has been taught to talk is worth from
4<i>l.</i> to 10<i>l.</i>, according to its proficiency in speech.
About 500 of these birds are sold yearly by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
street-hawkers, at an outlay to the public of from
500<i>l.</i> to 600<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Java sparrows, from the East Indies, and from
the Islands of the Archipelago, are brought to
London, but considerable quantities die during the
voyage and in this country; for, though hardy
enough, not more than one in three survives being
“taken off the paddy seed.” About 10,000, however,
are sold annually, in London, at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each,
but a very small proportion by street-hawking, as
the Java sparrows are chiefly in demand for the
aviaries of the rich in town and country. In some
years not above 100 may be sold in the streets;
in others, as many as 500.</p>

<p>In St. Helena birds, known also as wax-bills
and red-backs, there is a trade to the same extent,
both as regards number and price; but the street-sale
is perhaps 10 per cent. lower.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Birds’-Nests.</span></h3>

<p>The young gypsy-looking lad, who gave me the
following account of the sale of birds’-nests in the
streets, was peculiarly picturesque in his appearance.
He wore a dirty-looking smock-frock with
large pockets at the side; he had no shirt; and his
long black hair hung in curls about him, contrasting
strongly with his bare white neck and chest. The
broad-brimmed brown Italian-looking hat, broken
in and ragged at the top, threw a dark half-mask-like
shadow over the upper part of his face. His
feet were bare and black with mud: he carried in
one hand his basket of nests, dotted with their
many-coloured eggs; in the other he held a live
snake, that writhed and twisted as its metallic-looking
skin glistened in the sun; now over, and
now round, the thick knotty bough of a tree that
he used for a stick. The portrait of the youth is
here given. I have never seen so picturesque a
specimen of the English nomads. He said, in
answer to my <span class="lock">inquiries:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am a seller of birds’-nesties, snakes, slow-worms,
adders, ‘effets’&mdash;lizards is their common
name&mdash;hedgehogs (for killing black beetles); frogs
(for the French&mdash;they eats ’em); snails (for birds);
that’s all I sell in the summer-time. In the
winter I get all kinds of wild flowers and roots,
primroses, ‘butter-cups’ and daisies, and snow-drops,
and ‘backing’ off of trees; (‘backing’ it’s called,
because it’s used to put at the back of nosegays,
it’s got off the yew trees, and is the green yew
fern). I gather bulrushes in the summer-time,
besides what I told you; some buys bulrushes
for stuffing; they’re the fairy rushes the small
ones, and the big ones is bulrushes. The small
ones is used for ‘stuffing,’ that is, for showing
off the birds as is stuffed, and make ’em seem
as if they was alive in their cases, and among
the rushes; I sell them to the bird-stuffers at
1<i>d.</i> a dozen. The big rushes the boys buys to
play with and beat one another&mdash;on a Sunday
evening mostly. The birds’-nesties I get from 1<i>d.</i>
to 3<i>d.</i> a-piece for. I never have young birds, I can
never sell ’em; you see the young things generally
dies of the cramp before you can get rid of them.
I sell the birds’-nesties in the streets; the threepenny
ones has six eggs, a half-penny a egg.
The linnets has mostly four eggs, they’re 4<i>d.</i>
the nest; they’re for putting under canaries,
and being hatched by them. The thrushes has
from four to five&mdash;five is the most; they’re
2<i>d.</i>; they’re merely for cur’osity&mdash;glass cases
or anything like that. Moor-hens, wot build
on the moors, has from eight to nine eggs, and
is 1<i>d.</i> a-piece; they’re for hatching underneath
a bantam-fowl, the same as partridges. Chaffinches
has five eggs; they’re 3<i>d.</i>, and is for
cur’osity. Hedge-sparrows, five eggs; they’re
the same price as the other, and is for cur’osity.
The Bottletit&mdash;the nest and the bough are always
put in glass cases; it’s a long hanging
nest, like a bottle, with a hole about as big as a
sixpence, and there’s mostly as many as eighteen
eggs; they’ve been known to lay thirty-three.
To the house-sparrow there is five eggs; they’re
1<i>d.</i> The yellow-hammers, with five eggs, is 2<i>d.</i>
The water-wagtails, with four eggs, 2<i>d.</i> Blackbirds,
with five eggs, 2<i>d.</i> The golden-crest wren,
with ten eggs&mdash;it has a very handsome nest&mdash;is
6<i>d.</i> Bulfinches, four eggs, 1<i>s.</i>; they’re for hatching,
and the bulfinch is a very dear bird. Crows,
four eggs, 4<i>d.</i> Magpies, four eggs, 4<i>d.</i> Starlings,
five eggs, 3<i>d.</i> The egg-chats, five eggs, 2<i>d.</i> Goldfinches,
five eggs, 6<i>d.</i>, for hatching. Martins, five
eggs, 3<i>d.</i> The swallow, four eggs, 6<i>d.</i>; it’s so dear
because the nest is such a cur’osity, they build up
again the house. The butcher-birds&mdash;hedge-murderers
some calls them, for the number of birds they
kills&mdash;five eggs, 3<i>d.</i> The cuckoo&mdash;they never has
a nest, but lays in the hedge-sparrow’s; there’s
only one egg (it’s very rare you see the two, they
has been got, but that’s seldom) that is 4<i>d.</i>, the
egg is such a cur’osity. The greenfinches has
four or five eggs, and is 3<i>d.</i> The sparrer-hawk has
four eggs, and they’re 6<i>d.</i> The reed-sparrow&mdash;they
builds in the reeds close where the bulrushes
grow; they has four eggs, and is 2<i>d.</i> The
wood-pigeon has two eggs, and they’re 4<i>d.</i> The
horned owl, four eggs; they’re 6<i>d.</i> The woodpecker&mdash;I
never see no more nor two&mdash;they’re
6<i>d.</i> the two; they’re a great cur’osity, very
seldom found. The kingfishers has four eggs, and
is 6<i>d.</i> That’s all I know of.</p>

</div>

<p>“I gets the eggs mostly from Witham and
Chelmsford, in Essex; Chelmsford is 20 mile from
Whitechapel Church, and Witham, 8 mile further.
I know more about them parts than anywhere
else, being used to go after moss for Mr. Butler, of
the herb-shop in Covent Garden. Sometimes I go
to Shirley Common and Shirley Wood, that’s three
miles from Croydon, and Croydon is ten from
Westminster-bridge. When I’m out bird-nesting
I take all the cross country roads across fields and
into the woods. I begin bird-nesting in May
and leave off about August, and then comes the bulrushing,
and they last till Christmas; and after that
comes the roots and wild flowers, which serves me
up to May again. I go out bird-nesting three
times a week. I go away at night, and come up
on the morning of the day after. I’m away a
day and two nights. I start between one and
two in the morning and walk all night&mdash;for the
coolness&mdash;you see the weather’s so hot you can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
do it in the daytime. When I get down I go to
sleep for a couple of hours. I ‘skipper it’&mdash;turn
in under a hedge or anywhere. I get down about
nine in the morning, at Chelmsford, and about
one if I go to Witham. After I’ve had my sleep
I start off to get my nests and things. I climb the
trees, often I go up a dozen in the day, and
many a time there’s nothing in the nest when I
get up. I only fell once; I got on the end of the
bough and slipped off. I p’isoned my foot once
with the stagnant water going after the bulrushes,&mdash;there
was horseleeches, and effets, and all kinds
of things in the water, and they stung me, I
think. I couldn’t use my foot hardly for six
weeks afterwards, and was obliged to have a
stick to walk with. I couldn’t get about at all
for four days, and should have starved if it hadn’t
been that a young man kept me. He was a printer
by trade, and almost a stranger to me, only he
seed me and took pity on me. When I fell off the
bough I wasn’t much hurt, nothing to speak of. The
house-sparrow is the worst nest of all to take;
it’s no value either when it <i>is</i> got, and is the most
difficult of all to get at. You has to get up a sparapet
(a parapet) of a house, and either to get
permission, or run the risk of going after it without.
Partridges’ eggs (they has no nest) they gives
you six months for, if they see you selling them,
because it’s game, and I haven’t no licence; but
while you’re hawking, that is showing ’em, they
can’t touch you. The owl is a very difficult nest
to get, they builds so high in the trees. The
bottle-tit is a hard nest to find; you may go all
the year round, and, perhaps, only get one. The
nest I like best to get is the chaffinch, because
they’re in the hedge, and is no bother. Oh, you
hasn’t got the skylark down, sir; they builds on
the ground, and has five eggs; I sell them for 4<i>d.</i>
The robin-redbreast has five eggs, too, and is 3<i>d.</i>
The ringdove has two eggs, and is 6<i>d.</i> The tit-lark&mdash;that’s
five blue eggs, and very rare&mdash;I get
4<i>d.</i> for them. The jay has five eggs, and a flat
nest, very wiry, indeed; it’s a ground bird;
that’s 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;the egg is just like a partridge egg.
When I first took a kingfisher’s nest, I didn’t
know the name of it, and I kept wondering what
it was. I daresay I asked three dozen people,
and none of them could tell me. At last a bird-fancier,
the lame man at the Mile-end gate, told
me what it was. I likes to get the nesties to sell,
but I havn’t no fancy for birds. Sometimes I
get squirrels’ nesties with the young in ’em&mdash;about
four of ’em there mostly is, and they’re the only
young things I take&mdash;the young birds I leaves;
they’re no good to me. The four squirrels brings
me from 6<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> After I takes a bird’s nest, the
old bird comes dancing over it, chirupping, and
crying, and flying all about. When they lose
their nest they wander about, and don’t know
where to go. Oftentimes I wouldn’t take them if
it wasn’t for the want of the victuals, it seems
such a pity to disturb ’em after they’ve made
their little bits of places. Bats I never take myself&mdash;I
can’t get over ’em. If I has an order for
’em, I buys ’em of boys.</p>

<p>“I mostly start off into the country on Monday
and come up on Wednesday. The most nesties as
ever I took is twenty-two, and I generally get about
twelve or thirteen. These, if I’ve an order, I
sell directly, or else I may be two days, and sometimes
longer, hawking them in the street. Directly
I’ve sold them I go off again that night, if it’s
fine; though I often go in the wet, and then I
borrow a tarpaulin of a man in the street where I
live. If I’ve a quick sale I get down and back
three times in a week, but then I don’t go so far
as Witham, sometimes only to Rumford; that is
12 miles from Whitechapel Church. I never got
an order from a bird-fancier; they gets all the
eggs they want of the countrymen who comes up
to market.</p>

<p>“It’s gentlemen I gets my orders of, and then
mostly they tells me to bring ’em one nest of every
kind I can get hold of, and that will often last me
three months in the summer. There’s one gentleman
as I sells to is a wholesale dealer in window-glass&mdash;and
he has a hobby for them. He puts
’em into glass cases, and makes presents of ’em
to his friends. He has been one of my best customers.
I’ve sold him a hundred nesties, I’m
sure. There’s a doctor at Dalston I sell a great
number to&mdash;he’s taking one of every kind of me
now. The most of my customers is stray ones in
the streets. They’re generally boys. I sells a
nest now and then to a lady with a child; but
the boys of twelve to fifteen years of age is my
best friends. They buy ’em only for cur’osity.
I sold three partridges’ eggs yesterday to a gentleman,
and he said he would put them under a
bantam he’d got, and hatch ’em.</p>

<p>“The snakes, and adders, and slow-worms I get
from where there’s moss or a deal of grass.
Sunny weather’s the best for them, they won’t
come out when it’s cold; then I go to a dung-heap,
and turn it over. Sometimes, I find five or
six there, but never so large as the one I had
to-day, that’s a yard and five inches long, and
three-quarters of a pound weight. Snakes is 5<i>s.</i>
a pound. I sell all I can get to Mr. Butler, of
Covent-garden. He keeps ’em alive, for they’re
no good dead. I think it’s for the skin they’re
kept. Some buys ’em to dissect: a gentleman
in Theobalds-road does so, and so he does hedgehogs.
Some buys ’em for stuffing, and others
for cur’osities. Adders is the same price as
snakes, 5<i>s.</i> a pound after they first comes in,
when they’re 10<i>s.</i> Adders is wanted dead;
it’s only the fat and skin that’s of any value;
the fat is used for curing p’isoned wounds, and
the skin is used for any one as has cut their
heads. Farmers buys the fat, and rubs it into
the wound when they gets bitten or stung by
anything p’isonous. I kill the adders with a
stick, or, when I has shoes, I jumps on ’em.
Some fine days I get four or five snakes at a
time; but then they’re mostly small, and won’t
weigh above half a pound. I don’t get many
adders&mdash;they don’t weigh many ounces, adders
don’t&mdash;and I mostly has 9<i>d.</i> a-piece for each I
gets. I sells <i>them</i> to Mr. Butler as well.</p>

<p>“The hedgehogs is 1<i>s.</i> each; I gets them mostly
in Essex. I’ve took one hedgehog with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
young ones, and sold the lot for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> People
in the streets bought them of me&mdash;they’re wanted
to kill the black-beetles; they’re fed on bread and
milk, and they’ll suck a cow quite dry in their
wild state. They eat adders, and can’t be p’isoned,
at least it says so in a book I’ve got about ’em at
home.</p>

<p>“The effets I gets orders for in the streets. Gentlemen
gives me their cards, and tells me to bring
them one; they’re 2<i>d.</i> apiece. I get them at
Hampstead and Highgate, from the ponds.
They’re wanted for cur’osity.</p>

<p>“The snails and frogs I sell to Frenchmen. I
don’t know what part they eat of the frog, but I
know they buy them, and the dandelion root.
The frogs is 6<i>d.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> a dozen. They like the
yellow-bellied ones, the others they’re afraid is
toads. They always pick out the yellow-bellied
first; I don’t know how to feed ’em, or else I
might fatten them. Many people swallows young
frogs, they’re reckoned very good things to clear
the inside. The frogs I catch in ponds and ditches
up at Hampstead and Highgate, but I only get
them when I’ve a order. I’ve had a order for
as many as six dozen, but that was for the French
hotel in Leicester-square; but I <i>have</i> sold three
dozen a week to one man, a Frenchman, as
keeps a cigar shop in <span class="lock">R&mdash;r’s-</span>court.</p>

<p>“The snails I sell by the pailful&mdash;at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the pail. There is some hundreds in a pail.
The wet weather is the best times for catching
’em; the French people eats ’em. They boils ’em
first to get ’em out of the shell and get rid of
the green froth; then they boils them again, and
after that in vinegar. They eats ’em hot, but
some of the foreigners likes ’em cold. They say
they’re better, if possible, than whelks. I used
to sell a great many to a lady and gentleman
in Soho-square, and to many of the French I sell
1<i>s.</i>’s worth, that’s about three or four quarts.
Some persons buys snails for birds, and some to
strengthen a sickly child’s back; they rub the
back all over with the snails, and a very good
thing they tell me it is. I used to take 2<i>s.</i>’s worth
a week to one woman; it’s the green froth that
does the greatest good. There are two more
birds’-nest sellers besides myself, they don’t do as
many as me the two of ’em. They’re very naked,
their things is all to ribbins; they only go into
the country once in a fortnight. They was never
nothing, no trade&mdash;they never was in place&mdash;from
what I’ve heard&mdash;either of them. I reckon I sell
about 20 nesties a week take one week with
another, and that I do for four months in the year.
(This altogether makes 320 nests.) Yes, I should
say, I do sell about 300 birds’-nests every year,
and the other two, I’m sure, don’t sell half that.
Indeed they don’t want to sell; they does better
by what they gets give to them. I can’t say
what they takes, they’re Irish, and I never was in
conversation with them. I get about 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>
for the 20 nests, that’s between 2<i>d.</i> and 3<i>d.</i>
apiece. I sell about a couple of snakes every
week, and for some of them I get 1<i>s.</i>, and
for the big ones 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but them <i>I</i> seldom
find. I’ve only had three hedgehogs this season,
and I’ve done a little in snails and frogs, perhaps
about 1<i>s.</i> The many foreigners in London this
season hasn’t done me no good. I haven’t been to
Leicester-square lately, or perhaps I might have
got a large order or two for frogs.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Life of a Bird’s-Nest Seller.</span></h3>

<p>“I am 22 years of age. My father was a dyer,
and I was brought up to the same trade. My
father lived at Arundel, in Sussex, and kept a
shop there. He had a good business as dyer,
scourer, calico glazer, and furniture cleaner. I
have heard mother say his business in Arundel
brought him in 300<i>l.</i> a year at least. He had
eight men in his employ, and none under 30<i>s.</i> a
week. I had two brothers and one sister, but
one of my brothers is since dead. Mother died
five years ago in the Consumption Hospital,
at Chelsea, just after it was built. I was very
young indeed when father died; I can hardly
remember him. He died in Middlesex Hospital:
he had abscesses all over him; there were six-and-thirty
at the time of his death. I’ve heard
mother say many times that she thinked it was
through exerting himself too much at his business
that he fell ill. The ruin of father was owing
to his house being burnt down; the fire broke out
at two in the morning; he wasn’t insured: I
don’t remember the fire; I’ve only heerd mother
talk about it. It was the ruin of us all she used
to tell me; father had so much work belonging to
other people; a deal of moreen curtains, five or
six hundred yards. It was of no use his trying
to start again: he lost all his glazing machines
and tubs, and his drugs and ‘punches.’ From
what I’ve heerd from mother they was worth
some hundreds. The Duke of Norfolk, after the
fire, gave a good lot of money to the poor people
whose things father had to clean, and father himself
came up to London. I wasn’t two year old
when that happened. We all come up with father,
and he opened a shop in London and bought all
new things. He had got a bit of money left,
and mother’s uncle lent him 60<i>l.</i> We lived two
doors from the stage door of the Queen’s Theatre,
in Pitt-street, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square;
but father didn’t do much in London; he had a
new connection to make, and when he died his
things was sold for the rent of the house. There
was only money enough to bury him. I don’t
know how long ago that was, but I think it was
about three years after our coming to London, for
I’ve heerd mother say I was six years old when
father died. After father’s death mother borrowed
some more money of her uncle, who was well to
do. He was perfumer to her Majesty: he’s dead
now, and left the business to his foreman. The
business was worth 2000<i>l.</i> His wife, my mother’s
aunt, is alive still, and though she’s a woman of
large property, she won’t so much as look at me.
She keeps her carriage and two footmen; her
address is, Mrs. Lewis, No. 10, Porchester-terrace,
Bayswater. I have been in her drawing-room
two or three times. I used to take
letters to her from mother: she was very kind
to me then, and give me several half-crowns. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
knows the state I am in now. A young man
wrote a letter to her, saying I had no clothes to
look after work in, and that I was near starving,
but she sent no answer to it. The last time I
called at her house she sent me down nothing,
and bid the servant tell me not to come any more.
Ever since I’ve wanted it I’ve never had nothing
from her, but before that she used to give me
something whenever I took a letter from mother
to her. The last half-crown I got at her house
was from the cook, who gave it me out of her
own money because she’d known my mother.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a grandmother living in Woburn-place;
she’s in service there, and been in the
family for twenty years. The gentleman died
lately and left her half his property. He was a
foreigner and had no relations here. My grandmother
used to be very good to me, and when I
first got out of work she always gave me something
when I called, and had me down in her
room. She was housekeeper then. She never
offered to get me a situation, but only gave me a
meal of victuals and a shilling or eighteen-pence
whenever I called. I was tidy in my dress
then. At last a new footman came, and he told
me as I wasn’t to call again; he said, the family
didn’t allow no followers. I’ve never seen my
grandmother since that time but once, and then I
was passing with my basket of birds’ nests in my
hand just as she was coming out of the door. I was
dressed about the same then as you seed me yesterday.
I was without a shirt to my back. I don’t
think she saw me, and I was ashamed to let her see
me as I was. She was kind enough to me, that is,
she wouldn’t mind about giving me a shilling or so
at a time, but she never would do nothing else for
me, and yet she had got plenty of money in the
bank, and a gold watch, and all, at her side.</p>

<p>“After father died, as I was saying, mother
got some money from her uncle and set up on her
own account; she took in glazing for the trade.
Father had a few shops that he worked for, and
they employed mother after his death. She kept
on at this for eighteen months and then she got
married again. Before this an uncle of mine, my
father’s brother, who kept some lime-kilns down
in Bury St. Edmunds, consented to take my
brother and sister and provide for them, and four
or five year ago he got them both into the Duke
of Norfolk’s service, and there they are now.
They’ve never seen me since I was a child but once,
and that was a few year ago. I’ve never sent
to them to say how badly I was off. They’re
younger than I am, and can only just take care of
theirselves. When mother married again, her
husband came to live at the house; he was a dyer.
He behaved very well to me. Mother wouldn’t
send me down to uncle’s, she was too fond of me.
I was sent to school for about eighteen months,
and after that I used to assist in the glazing at
home, and so I went on very comfortable for some
time. Nine year ago I went to work at a French
dyer’s, in Rathbone-place. My step-father got me
there, and there I stopped six year. I lived in
the house after the first eighteen months of my
service. Five year ago mother fell ill; she had
been ailing many years, and she got admitted into
the Consumption Hospital, at Brompton. She was
there just upon three months and was coming out
the next day (her term was up), when she died
on the over night. After that my step-father
altered very much towards me. He didn’t want
me at home at all. He told me so a fortnight
after mother was in her grave. He took to
drinking very hearty directly she was gone. He
would do anything for me before that. He used
to take me with him to every place of amusement
what he went to, but when he took to drinking
he quite changed; then he got to beat me, and at
last he told me I needn’t come there any more.</p>

<p>“After that, I still kept working in Rathbone-place,
and got a lodging of my own; I used to have
9<i>s.</i> a week where I was, and I paid 2<i>s.</i> a week for
my bed, and washing, and mending. I had half a
room with a man and his wife; I went on so for
about two years, and then I was took bad with the
scarlet fever and went to Gray’s-inn-lane hospital.
After I was cured of the scarlet fever, I had the
brain fever, and was near my death; I was altogether
eight weeks in the hospital, and when I
come out I could get no work where I had been
before. The master’s nephew had come from
Paris, and they had all French hands in the house.
He wouldn’t employ an English hand at all.
He give me a trifle of money, and told me he
would pay my lodgings for a week or two while I
looked for work. I sought all about and couldn’t
find any; this was about three year ago. People
wouldn’t have me because I didn’t know nothing
about the English mode of business. I couldn’t
even tell the names of the English drugs, having
been brought up in a French house. At last, my
master got tired of paying for my lodging, and I
used to try and pick up a few pence in the streets
by carrying boxes and holding horses, it was all
as I could get to do; I tried all I could to find
employment, and they was the only jobs I could
get. But I couldn’t make enough for my lodging
this way, and over and over again I’ve had to
sleep out. Then I used to walk the streets most
of the night, or lie about in the markets till
morning came in the hopes of getting a job.
I’m a very little eater, and perhaps that’s the
luckiest thing for such as me; half a pound of
bread and a few potatoes will do me for the day.
If I could afford it, I used to get a ha’porth
of coffee and a ha’porth of sugar, and make it do
twice. Sometimes I used to have victuals give to
me, sometimes I went without altogether; and
sometimes I couldn’t eat. I can’t always.</p>

<p>“Six weeks after I had been knocking about in
the streets in the manner I’ve told you, a man I
met in Covent-Garden market told me he was
going into the country to get some roots (it was
in the winter time and cold indeed; I was
dressed about the same as I am now, only I had
a pair of boots); and he said if I chose to go
with him, he’d give me half of whatever he
earned. I went to Croydon and got some primroses;
my share came to 9<i>d.</i>, and that was quite a
God-send to me, after getting nothing. Sometimes
before that I’d been two days without tasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
anything; and when I got some victuals after
that, I couldn’t touch them. All I felt was giddy;
I wasn’t to say hungry, only weak and sicklified.
I went with this man after the roots two or three
times; he took me to oblige me, and show me
the way how to get a bit of food for myself; after
that, when I got to know all about it, I went to
get roots on my own account. I never felt a
wish to take nothing when I was very hard up.
Sometimes when I got cold and was tired, walking
about and weak from not having had nothing to
eat, I used to think I’d break a window and take
something out to get locked up; but I could
never make my mind up to it; they never hurt
me, I’d say to myself. I do fancy though, if
anybody had refused me a bit of bread, I should
have done something again them, but I couldn’t,
do you see, in cold blood like.</p>

<p>“When the summer came round a gentleman
whom I seed in the market asked me if I’d get
him half a dozen nesties&mdash;he didn’t mind what
they was, so long as they was small, and of different
kinds&mdash;and as I’d come across a many in
my trips after the flowers, I told him I would do
so&mdash;and that first put it into my head; and I’ve
been doing that every summer since then. It’s
poor work, though, at the best. Often and often
I have to walk 30 miles out without any victuals
to take with me, or money to get any, and 30
miles again back, and bring with me about a
dozen nesties; and, perhaps, if I’d no order for
them, and was forced to sell them to the boys, I
shouldn’t get more than a shilling for the lot after
all. When the time comes round for it, I go
Christmasing and getting holly, but that’s more
dangerous work than bird-nesting; the farmers
don’t mind your taking the nesties, as it prevents
the young birds from growing up and eating their
corn. The greater part of the holly used in London
for trimming up the churches and sticking in
the puddings, is stolen by such as me, at the risk
of getting six months for it. The farmers brings
a good lot to market, but we is obligated to steal
it. Take one week with another, I’m sure I
don’t make above 5<i>s.</i> You can tell that to look
at me. I don’t drink, and I don’t gamble; so
you can judge how much I get when I’ve had to
pawn my shirt for a meal. All last week I only
sold two nesties&mdash;they was a partridge’s and a
yellow-hammer’s; for one I got 6<i>d.</i>, and the other
3<i>d.</i>, and I had been thirteen miles to get them.
I got beside that a fourpenny piece for some
chickweed which I’d been up to Highgate to
gather for a man with a bad leg (it’s the best
thing there is for a poultice to a wound), and then
I earned another 4<i>d.</i> by some mash (marsh) mallow
leaves (that there was to purify the blood of
a poor woman): that, with 4<i>d.</i> that a gentleman
give to me, was all I got last week; 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> I think
it is altogether. I had some victuals give to me in
the street, or else I daresay I should have had to
go without; but, as it was, I gave the money to
the man and his wife I live with. You see they
had nothing, and as they’re good to me when I
want, why, I did what I could for them. I’ve
tried to get out of my present life, but there
seems to be an ill luck again me. Sometimes I
gets a good turn. A gentleman gives me an
order, and then I saves a shilling or eighteenpence,
so as to buy something with that I can sell
again in the streets; but a wet day is sure to
come, and then I’m cracked up, obligated to eat
it all away. Once I got to sell fish. A gentleman
give me a crown-piece in the street, and I
borrowed a barrow at 2<i>d.</i> a day, and did pretty
well for a time. In three weeks I had saved
18<i>s.</i>; then I got an order for a sack of moss
from one of the flower-sellers, and I went down
to Chelmsford, and stopped for the night in
Lower Nelson-street, at the sign of “The Three
Queens.” I had my money safe in my fob the
night before, and a good pair of boots to my feet
then; when I woke in the morning my boots was
gone, and on feeling in my fob my money was
gone too. There was four beds in the rooms,
feather and flock; the feather ones was 4<i>d.</i>, and
the flock 3<i>d.</i> for a single one, and 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> each
person for a double one. There was six people
in the room that night, and one of ’em was gone
before I awoke&mdash;he was a cadger&mdash;and had took
my money with him. I complained to the landlord&mdash;they
call him George&mdash;but it was no good;
all I could get was some victuals. So I’ve been
obliged to keep to birds’-nesting ever since.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been in prison but once. I was took
up for begging. I was merely leaning again the
railings of Tavistock-square with my birds’-nesties
in my hand, and the policemen took me off to
Clerkenwell, but the magistrates, instead of sending
me to prison, gave me 2<i>s.</i> out of the poors’-box.
I feel it very much going about without
shoes or without shirt, and exposed to all weathers,
and often out all night. The doctor at
the hospital in Gray’s-inn-lane gave me two
flannels, and told me that whatever I did I was
to keep myself wrapped up; but what’s the use
of saying that to such as me who is obligated to
pawn the shirt off our back for food the first wet
day as comes? If you haven’t got money to pay
for your bed at a lodging-house, you must take
the shirt off your back and leave it with them, or
else they’ll turn you out. I know many such.
Sometimes I go to an artist. I had 5<i>s.</i> when I was
drawed before the Queen. I wasn’t ’xactly
drawed before her, but my portrait was shown to
her, and I was told that if I’d be there I might
receive a trifle. I was drawed as a gipsy
fiddler. Mr. Oakley in Regent-street was the
gentleman as did it. I was dressed in some things
he got for me. I had an Italian’s hat, one with
a broad brim and a peaked crown, a red plush
waistcoat, and a yellow hankercher tied in a good
many knots round my neck. I’d a black velveteen
Newmarket-cut coat, with very large pearl buttons,
and a pair of black knee-breeches tied with
fine red strings. Then I’d blue stripe stockings
and high-ancle boots with very thin soles. I’d a
fiddle in one hand and a bow in the other. The
gentleman said he drawed me for my head of hair.
I’ve never been a gipsy, but he told me he
didn’t mind that, for I should make as good a
gipsy fiddler as the real thing. The artists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
mostly give me 2<i>s.</i> I’ve only been three times.
I only wish I could get away from my present
life. Indeed I would do any work if I could get
it. I’m sure I could have a good character from
my masters in Rathbone-place, for I never done
nothing wrong. But if I couldn’t get work I
might very well, if I’d money enough, get a
few flowers to sell. As it is it’s more than any one
can do to save at bird-nesting, and I’m sure I’m
as prudent as e’er a one in the streets. I never
took the pledge, but still I never take no beer nor
spirits&mdash;I never did. Mother told me never to
touch ’em, and I haven’t tasted a drop. I’ve
often been in a public-house selling my things, and
people has offered me something to drink, but I
never touch any. I can’t tell why I dislike doing so&mdash;but
something seems to tell me not to taste such
stuff. I don’t know whether it’s what my mother
said to me. I know I was very fond of her, but
I don’t say it’s that altogether as makes me do it.
I don’t feel to want it. I smoke a good bit,
and would sooner have a bit of baccy than a
meal at any time. I could get a goodish rig-out
in the lane for a few shillings. A pair of
boots would cost me 2<i>s.</i>, and a coat I could get
for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I go to a ragged school three times a
week if I can, for I’m but a poor scholar still, and
I should like to know how to read; it’s always
handy you know, sir.”</p>

<p>This lad has been supplied with a suit of
clothes and sufficient money to start him in some
of the better kind of street-trades. It was thought
advisable not to put him to any more <i>settled</i> occupation
on account of the vagrant habits he has
necessarily acquired during his bird-nesting career.
Before doing this he was employed as errand-boy
for a week, with the object of testing his trustworthiness,
and was found both honest and attentive.
He appears a prudent lad, but of course it
is difficult, as yet, to speak positively as to his
character. He has, however, been assured that if
he shows a disposition to follow some more reputable
calling he shall at least be put in the way
of so doing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Squirrels.</span></h3>

<p>The street squirrel-sellers are generally the same
men as are engaged in the open-air traffic in cage-birds.
There are, however, about six men who
devote themselves more particularly to squirrel-selling,
while as many more sometimes “take a
turn at it.” The squirrel is usually carried in
the vendor’s arms, or is held against the front of
his coat, so that the animal’s long bushy tail is
seen to advantage. There is usually a red leather
collar round its neck, to which is attached some
slender string, but so contrived that the squirrel
shall not appear to be a prisoner, nor in general&mdash;although
perhaps the hawker became possessed
of his squirrel only that morning&mdash;does the animal
show any symptoms of fear.</p>

<p>The chief places in which squirrels are offered
for sale, are Regent-street and the Royal Exchange,
but they are offered also in all the principal
thoroughfares&mdash;especially at the West End. The
purchasers are gentlefolk, tradespeople, and a few
of the working classes who are fond of animals.
The wealthier persons usually buy the squirrels
for their children, and, even after the free life of
the woods, the animal seems happy enough in the
revolving cage, in which it “thinks it climbs.”</p>

<p>The prices charged are from 2<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, “or more
if it can be got,” from a third to a half being profit.
The sellers will oft enough state, if questioned,
that they caught the squirrels in Epping Forest,
or Caen Wood, or any place sufficiently near
London, but such is hardly ever the case, for the
squirrels are bought by them of the dealers in live
animals. Countrymen will sometimes catch a few
squirrels and bring them to London, and nine
times out of ten they sell them to the shopkeepers.
To sell three squirrels a day in the
street is accounted good work.</p>

<p>I am assured by the best-informed parties that
for five months of the year there are 20 men
selling squirrels in the streets, at from 20 to 50
per cent. profit, and that they average a weekly
sale of six each. The average price is from 2<i>s.</i> to
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, although not very long ago one man sold
a “wonderfully fine squirrel” in the street for
three half-crowns, but they are sometimes parted
with for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or less, rather than be kept over-night.
Thus 2400 squirrels are vended yearly in
the streets, at a cost to the public of 240<i>l.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Leverets, Wild
Rabbits, etc.</span></h3>

<p>There are a few leverets, or young hares, sold in
the streets, and they are vended for the most part
in the suburbs, where the houses are somewhat
detached, and where there are plenty of gardens.
The softness and gentleness of the leveret’s look
pleases children, more especially girls, I am informed,
and it is usually through their importunity
that the young hares are bought, in order
that they may be fed from the garden, and run
tame about an out-house. The leverets thus
sold, however, as regards nine out of ten,
soon die. They are rarely supplied with their
natural food, and all their natural habits are
interrupted. They are in constant fear and danger,
moreover, from both dogs and cats. One
shopkeeper who sold fancy rabbits in a street off
the Westminster-road told me that he had once
tried to tame and rear leverets in hutches, as he
did rabbits, but to no purpose. He had no doubt
it might be done, he said, but not in a shop or a
small house. Three or four leverets are hawked
by the street-people in one basket and are seen
lying on hay, the basket having either a wide-worked
lid, or a net thrown over it. The hawkers
of live poultry sell the most leverets, but they are
vended also by the singing-bird sellers. The
animals are nearly all bought, for this traffic, at
Leadenhall, and are retailed at 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> each,
one-third to one-half being profit. Perhaps 300
are sold this way yearly, producing 22<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>About 400 young wild rabbits are sold in the
street in a similar way, but at lower sums, from
3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> each, 4<i>d.</i> being the most frequent rate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The yearly outlay is thus 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> They thrive,
in confinement, no better than the leverets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Gold and
Silver Fish.</span></h3>

<p>Of these dealers, residents in London, there are
about 70; but during my inquiry (at the beginning
of July) there were not 20 in town. One
of their body knew of ten who were at work live-fish
selling, and there might be as many more,
he thought, “working” the remoter suburbs of
Blackheath, Croydon, Richmond, Twickenham,
Isleworth, or wherever there are villa residences
of the wealthy. This is the season when
the gold and silver fish-sellers, who are altogether
a distinct class from the bird-sellers of the streets,
resort to the country, to vend their glass globes,
with the glittering fish swimming ceaselessly
round and round. The gold fish-hawkers are,
for the most part, of the very best class of the
street-sellers. One of the principal fish-sellers is
in winter a street-vendor of cough drops, hore-hound
candy, coltsfoot-sticks, and other medicinal
confectionaries, which he himself manufactures.
Another leading gold-fish seller is a costermonger
now “on pine-apples.” A third, “with a good
connection among the innkeepers,” is in the
autumn and winter a hawker of game and
poultry.</p>

<p>There are in London three wholesale dealers in
gold and silver fish; two of whom&mdash;one in the
Kingsland-road and the other close by Billingsgate&mdash;supply
more especially the street-sellers,
and the street-traffic is considerable. Gold fish
is one of the things which people buy when
brought to their doors, but which they seldom
care to “order.” The importunity of children
when a man unexpectedly tempts them with a
display of such brilliant creatures as gold fish, is
another great promotive of the street-trade; and
the street-traders are the best customers of the
wholesale purveyors, buying somewhere about
three-fourths of their whole stock. The dealers
keep their fish in tanks suited to the purpose, but
goldfish are never bred in London. The English-reared
gold fish are “raised” for the most part, as
respects the London market, in several places in
Essex. In some parts they are bred in warm
ponds, the water being heated by the steam from
adjacent machinery, and in some places they are
found to thrive well. Some are imported from
France, Holland, and Belgium; some are brought
from the Indies, and are usually sold to the
dealers to improve their breed, which every
now and then, I was told, “required a foreign
mixture, or they didn’t keep up their colour.”
The Indian and foreign fish, however, are also
sold in the streets; the dealers, or rather the
Essex breeders, who are often in London,
have “just the pick of them,” usually through
the agency of their town customers. The English-reared
gold fish are not much short of three-fourths
of the whole supply, as the importation
of these fishes is troublesome; and unless they
are sent under the care of a competent person, or
unless the master or steward of a vessel is made
to incur a share in the venture, by being paid
so much freight-money for as many gold and
silver fishes as are landed in good health, and
nothing for the dead or dying, it is very hazardous
sending them on shipboard at all, as in case of
neglect they may all die during the voyage.</p>

<p>The gold and silver fish are of the carp species,
and are natives of China, but they were first introduced
into this country from Portugal about
1690. Some are still brought from Portugal.
They have been common in England for about 120
years.</p>

<p>These fish are known in the street-trade as
“globe” and “pond” fish. The distinction is
not one of species, nor even of the “variety” of a
species, but merely a distinction of size. The
larger fish are “pond;” the smaller, “globe.”
But the difference on which the street-sellers
principally dwell is that the pond fish are far
more troublesome to keep by them in a “slack
time,” as they must be fed and tended most
sedulously. Their food is stale bread or biscuit.
The “globe” fish are not fed at all by the street-dealer,
as the animalcules and the minute insects
in the water suffice for their food. Soft, rain, or
sometimes Thames water, is used for the filling of
the globe containing a street-seller’s gold fish, the
water being changed twice a day, at a public-house
or elsewhere, when the hawker is on a
round. Spring-water is usually rejected, as the
soft water contains “more feed.” One man, however,
told me he had recourse to the street-pumps
for a renewal of water, twice, or occasionally
thrice a day, when the weather was sultry; but
spring or well water “wouldn’t do at all.” He
was quite unconscious that he was using it from
the pump.</p>

<p>The wholesale price of these fish ranges from
5<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> per dozen, with a higher charge for
“picked fish,” when high prices must be paid.
The cost of “large silvers,” for instance, which are
scarcer than “large golds,” so I heard them called,
is sometimes 5<i>s.</i> apiece, even to a retailer, and
rarely less than 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The most frequent price,
retail from the hawker&mdash;for almost all the fish
are hawked, but only there, I presume, for a temporary
purpose&mdash;is 2<i>s.</i> the pair. The gold fish
are now always hawked in glass globes, containing
about a dozen occupants, within a diameter
of twelve inches. These globes are sold by the
hawker, or, if ordered, supplied by him on his
next round that way, the price being about
2<i>s.</i> Glass globes, for the display of gold fish,
are indeed manufactured at from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
each, but 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is the usual limit to
the price of those vended in the street. The
fish are lifted out of the water in the globe to consign
to a purchaser, by being caught in a neat net,
of fine and different-coloured cordage, always
carried by the hawker, and manufactured for the
trade at 2<i>s.</i> the dozen. Neat handles for these
nets, of stained or plain wood, are 1<i>s.</i> the dozen.
The dealers avoid touching the fish with their
hands. Both gold fish and glass globes are much
cheaper than they were ten years ago; the globes
are cheaper, of course, since the alteration in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
tax on glass, and the street-sellers are, numerically,
nearly double what they were.</p>

<p>From a well-looking and well-spoken youth of
21 or 22, I had the following account. He was
the son, and grandson, of costermongers, but was&mdash;perhaps,
in consequence of his gold-fish selling
lying among a class not usually the costermongers’
customers&mdash;of more refined manners than the generality
of the costers’ children.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in the streets, sir,” he said, “helping
my father, until I was old enough to sell on
my own account, since I was six years old. <i>Yes,
I like a street life, I’ll tell you the plain truth,
for I was put by my father to a paperstainer, and
found I couldn’t bear to stay in doors. It would
have killed me.</i> Gold fish are as good a thing to
sell as anything else, perhaps, but I’ve been a
costermonger as well, and have sold both fruit
and good fish&mdash;salmon and fine soles. Gold fish
are not good for eating. I tried one once, just out
of curiosity, and it tasted very bitter indeed; I
tasted it boiled. I’ve worked both town and
country on gold fish. I’ve served both Brighton
and Hastings. The fish were sent to me by rail,
in vessels with air-holes, when I wanted more. I
never stopped at lodging-houses, but at respectable
public-houses, where I could be well suited in the
care of my fish. It’s an expense, but there’s no
help for it.” [A costermonger, when I questioned
him on the subject, told me that he had sometimes
sold gold fish in the country, and though he had
often enough slept in common lodging-houses, he
never could carry his fish there, for he felt satisfied,
although he had never tested the fact, that
in nine out of ten such places, the fish, in the
summer season, would half of them die during the
night from the foul air.] “Gold fish sell better in
the country than town,” the street-dealer continued;
“much better. They’re more thought of in the
country. My father’s sold them all over the world,
as the saying is. I’ve sold both foreign and
English fish. I prefer English. They’re the
hardiest; Essex fish. The foreign&mdash;I don’t just
know what part&mdash;are bred in milk ponds; kept
fresh and sweet, of course; and when they’re
brought here, and come to be put in cold water,
they soon die. In Essex they’re bred in cold
water. They live about three years; that’s their
lifetime if they’re properly seen to. I don’t know
what kind of fish gold fish are. I’ve heard that
they first came from China. No, I can’t read, and
I’m very sorry for it. If I have time next winter
I’ll get taught. Gentlemen sometimes ask me to
sit down, and talk to me about fish, and their history
(natural history), and I’m often at a loss, which
I mightn’t be if I could read. If I have fish left
after my day’s work, I never let them stay in the
globe I’ve hawked them in, but put them into a
large pan, a tub sometimes, three-parts full of
water, where they have room. My customers are
ladies and gentlemen, but I have sold to shopkeepers,
such as buttermen, that often show gold
fish and flowers in their shops. The fish don’t
live long in the very small globes, but they’re put
in them sometimes just to satisfy children. I’ve
sold as many as two dozen at a time to stock a
pond in a gentleman’s garden. It’s the best sale
a little way out of town, in any direction. I sell
six dozen a week, I think, one week with another;
they’ll run as to price at 1<i>s.</i> apiece. That six
dozen includes what I sell both in town and
country. Perhaps I sell them nearly three-parts
of the year. Some hawk all the year, but it’s a
poor winter trade. Yes, I make a very fair
living; 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> or so, a day, perhaps, on
gold fish, when the weather suits.”</p>

<p>A man, to whom I was referred as an experienced
gold fish-seller, had just returned, when I
saw him, from the sale of a stock of new potatoes,
peas, &amp;c., which he “worked” in a donkey cart.
He had not this season, he said, started in the
gold-fish line, and did very little last year in it, as
his costermongering trade kept steady, but his
wife thought gold fish-selling was a better trade,
and she always accompanied him in his street
rounds; so he might take to it again. In his
youth he was in the service of an old lady who
had several pets, and among them were gold fish,
of which she was very proud, always endeavouring
to procure the finest, a street-seller being sure
of her as a customer if he had fish larger or
deeper or brighter-coloured than usual. She kept
them both in stone cisterns, or small ponds, in her
garden, and in glass globes in the house. Of these
fish my informant had the care, and was often commended
for his good management of them. After
his mistress’s death he was very unlucky, he said,
in his places. His last master having been implicated,
he believed, in some gambling and bill-discounting
transactions, left the kingdom suddenly,
and my informant was without a character, for
the master he served previously to the one who
went off so abruptly was dead, and a character
two years back was of no use, for people said,
“But where have you been living since? Let me
know all about that.” The man did not know
what to do, for his money was soon exhausted:
“I had nothing left,” he said, “which I could
turn into money except a very good great coat,
which had belonged to my last master, and which
was given to me because he went off without
paying me my wages. I thought of ’listing, for
I was tired of a footman’s life, <i>almost always in
the house in such places as I had</i>, but I was
too old, I feared, and if I could have got over
that I knew I should be rejected because I was
getting bald. I was sitting thinking whatever
could be done&mdash;I wasn’t married then&mdash;and had
nobody to consult with; when I heard the very
man as used to serve my old lady crying gold
fish in the street. It struck me all of a heap, and
I wonder I hadn’t thought of it before, when I
recollected how well I’d managed the fish, that
I’d sell gold fish too, and hawk it as he did, as it
didn’t seem such a bad trade. So I asked the
man all about it, and he told me, and I raised a
sovereign on my great coat, and that was my start
in the streets. I was nervous, and a little ’shamed
at first, but I soon got over that, and in time
turned my hand to fruit and other things. Gold
fish saved my life, sir; I do believe that, for I
might have pined into a consumption if I’d been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
without something to do, and something to eat
much longer.”</p>

<p>If we calculate, in order to allow for the cessation
of the trade during the winter, and often in the
summer when costermongering is at its best, that
but half the above-mentioned number of gold-fish
sellers hawk in the streets and that for but half a
year, each selling six dozen weekly at 12<i>s.</i> the
dozen, we find 65,520 fish sold, at an outlay of
3276<i>l.</i> As the country is also “worked” by
the London street-sellers, and the supply is derived
from London, the number and amount may be
doubled to include this traffic, or 131,040 fish
sold, and 6552<i>l.</i> expended.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Tortoises.</span></h3>

<p>The number of tortoises sold in the streets of
London is far greater than might be imagined, for
it is a creature of no utility, and one which is
inanimate in this country for half its life.</p>

<p>Of live tortoises, there are 20,000 annually imported
from the port of Mogadore in Morocco.
They are not brought over, as are the parrots, &amp;c.,
of which I have spoken, for amusement or as private
ventures of the seamen, but are regularly
consigned from Jewish houses in Mogadore, to
Jewish merchants in London. They are a freight
of which little care is taken, as they are brought
over principally as ballast in the ship’s hold, where
they remain torpid.</p>

<p>The street-sellers of tortoises are costermongers
of the smarter class. Sometimes the vendors of
shells and foreign birds “work” also a few tortoises,
and occasionally a wholesale dealer (the
consignee of the Jewish house in Africa) will
send out his own servants to sell barrow-loads
of tortoises in the street on his own account.
They are regularly ranged on the barrows, and
certainly present a curious appearance&mdash;half-alive
creatures as they are (when the weather
is not of the warmest), brought from another
continent for sale by thousands in the streets
of London, and retention in the gardens and
grounds of our civic villas. Of the number
imported, one-half, or 10,000, are yearly sold in
the streets by the several open-air dealers I have
mentioned. The wholesale price is from 4<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i>
the dozen; they are retailed from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>, a
very fine well-grown tortoise being sometimes
worth 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The mass, however, are sold at
6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> each, but many fetch 1<i>s.</i> They
are bought for children, and to keep in gardens as
I have said, and when properly fed on lettuce
leaves, spinach, and similar vegetables, or on
white bread sopped in water, will live a long
time. If the tortoise be neglected in a garden,
and have no access to his favourite food, he will
eat almost any green thing which comes in his
way, and so may commit ravages. During the
winter, and the later autumn and earlier spring,
the tortoise is torpid, and may be kept in a
drawer or any recess, until the approach of summer
“thaws” him, as I heard it called.</p>

<p>Calculating the average price of tortoises in
street-sale at 8<i>d.</i> each, we find upwards of 333<i>l.</i>
thus expended yearly.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Snails, Frogs,
Worms, Snakes, Hedgehogs, etc.</span></h3>

<p>I class together these several kinds of live creatures,
as they are all “gathered” and sold by the
same persons&mdash;principally by the men who supply
bird-food, of whom I have given accounts in my
statements concerning groundsel, chickweed, plaintain,
and turf-selling.</p>

<p>The principal <i>snail-sellers</i>, however, are the
turf-cutters, who are young and active men, while
the groundsel-sellers are often old and infirm and
incapable of working all night, as the necessities
of the snail-trade often require. Of turf-cutters
there were, at the time of my inquiry last winter,
42 in London, and of these full one-third are regular
purveyors of snails, such being the daintier
diet of the caged blackbirds and thrushes. These
men obtain their supply of snails in the market-gardens,
the proprietors willingly granting leave to
any known or duly recommended person who will
rid them of these depredators. Seven-eighths of
the quantity gathered are sold to the bird-dealers,
to whom the price is 2<i>d.</i> a quart. The other
eighth is sold on a street round at from 3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>
the quart. A quart contains at least 80 snails,
not heaped up, their shells being measured along
with them. One man told me there were “100
snails to a fair quart.”</p>

<p>When it is moonlight at this season of the year,
the snail gatherers sometimes work all night; at
other times from an hour before sunset to the
decline of daylight, the work being resumed at
the dawn. To gather 12 quarts in a night, or a
long evening and morning, is accounted a prosperous
harvest. Half that quantity is “pretty
tidy.” An experienced man said to <span class="lock">me:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The best snail grounds, sir, you may take my
word for it, is in Putney and Barnes. It’s the
‘greys’ we go for, the fellows with the shells on
’em; the black snails or slugs is no good to us. I
think snails is the slowest got money of any. I
don’t suppose they get’s scarcer, but there’s good
seasons for snails and there’s bad. Warm and
wet is best. We don’t take the little ’uns. They
come next year. I may make 1<i>l.</i> a year, or a
little more, in snails. In winter there’s hardly
anything done in them, and the snails is on the
ground; in summer they’re on the walls or leaves.
They’ll keep six months without injury; they’ll
keep the winter round indeed in a proper place.”</p>

<p>I am informed that the 14 snail gatherers
on the average gather six dozen quarts each in a
year, which supplies a total of 12,096 quarts, or
individually, 1,189,440 snails. The labourers in
the gardens, I am informed, may gather somewhat
more than an equal quantity,&mdash;all being sold to
the bird-shops; so that altogether the supply of
snails for the caged thrushes and blackbirds of
London is about two millions and a half. Computing
them at 24,000 quarts, and only at 2<i>d.</i> a
quart, the outlay is 200<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>The <i>Frogs</i> sold by street-people are, at the rate
of about 36 dozen a year, disposed of in equal
proportion to University and King’s Colleges.
Only two men collect the frogs, one for each hos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>pital.
They are charged 1<i>d.</i> each:&mdash;“I’ve sometimes,”
said one of the frog-purveyors, “come on
a place where I could have got six or seven dozen
in a day, but that’s mostly been when I didn’t
want them. At other times I’ve gone days without
collaring a single frog. I only want them four
times a year, and four or five dozen at a time.
The low part of Hampstead’s the best ground for
them, I think. The doctors like big fellows. They
keep them in water ’til they’re wanted to dissect.”
One man thought that there might be 50 more
frogs or upwards ordered yearly, through the bird-shops,
for experiments under air-pumps, &amp;c. This
gives about 500 frogs sold yearly by the street-people.
One year, however, I was told, the supply
was larger, for a Camberwell gentleman ordered 40
frogs to stock a watery place at the foot of his
garden, as he liked to hear and see them.</p>

<p>The <i>Toad</i> trade is almost a nonentity. One
man, who was confident he had as good a trade in
that line as any of his fellows, told me that last
year he only supplied one toad; in one year, he
forgot the precise time, he collected ten. He was
confident that from 12 to 24 a year was now
the extent of the toad trade, perhaps 20. There
was no regular price, and the men only “work to
order.” “It’s just what the shopkeeper, mostly
a herbalist, likes to give.” I was told, from 1<i>d.</i> to
6<i>d.</i> according to size. “I don’t know what they’re
wanted for, something about the doctors, I believe.
But if you want any toads, sir, for anything, I
know a place between Hampstead and Willesden,
where there’s real stunners.”</p>

<p><i>Worms</i> are collected in small quantities by the
street-sellers, and very grudgingly, for they are to
be supplied gratuitously to the shopkeepers who
are the customers of the turf-cutters, and snail
and worm collectors. “They expects it as a
parquisite, like.” One man told me that they only
gathered ground worms for the bird-fanciers.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Snakes</i> and <i>Hedgehogs</i> I have already
spoken, when treating of the collection of birds’-nests.
I am told that some few <i>glow-worms</i> are
collected.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS_OF_MINERAL_PRODUCTIONS"></a>OF THE STREET-SELLERS OF MINERAL PRODUCTIONS
AND NATURAL CURIOSITIES.</h2>

</div>

<p>The class of which I have now to treat, including
as it does the street-sellers of coal, coke, tan-turf,
salt, and sand, seem to have been called
into existence principally by the necessities of
the poorer classes. As the earnings of thousands
of men, in all the slop, “slaughter-house,”
or “scamping” branches of tailoring, shoe-making,
cabinet-making, joining, &amp;c. have become
lower and lower, they are compelled to
purchase the indispensable articles of daily consumption
in the smallest quantities, and at irregular
times, just as the money is in their possession.
This is more especially the case as regards
chamber-masters and garret-masters (among the
shoemakers) and cabinet-makers, who, as they are
small masters, and working on their own account,
have not even such a regularity of payment as the
journeyman of the slop-tailor. Among these poor
artizans, moreover, the wife must slave with the
husband, and it is often an object with them to
save the time lost in going out to the chandler’s-shop
or the coal-shed, to have such things as coal,
and coke brought to their very doors, and vended
in the smallest quantities. It is the same with
the women who work for the slop-shirt merchants,
&amp;c., or make cap-fronts, &amp;c., on their own account,
for the supply of the shopkeepers, or the wholesale
swag-men, who sell low-priced millinery. The
street-sellers of the class I have now to notice are,
then, the principal purveyors of the very poor.</p>

<p>The men engaged in the street-sale of coal and
coke&mdash;the chief articles of this branch of the
street-sale&mdash;are of the costermonger class, as, indeed,
is usually the case where an exercise of
bodily strength is requisite. Costermongers, too,
are better versed than any other street-folk in the
management of barrows, carts, asses, ponies, or
horses, so that when these vehicles and these
animals are a necessary part of any open-air
business, it will generally be found in the hands
of the coster class.</p>

<p>Nor is this branch of the street-traffic confined
solely to articles of necessity. Under my present
enumeration will be found the street-sale of <i>shells</i>,
an ornament of the mantel-piece above the fire-grate
to which coal is a necessity.</p>

<p>The present division will complete the subject
of Street <i>Sale</i> in the metropolis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Coals.</span></h3>

<p>According to the returns of the coal market for
the last few years, there has been imported into
London, on an average, 3,500,000 tons of sea-borne
coal annually. Besides this immense supply,
the various railways have lately poured in a continuous
stream of the same commodity from the
inland districts, which has found a ready sale
without sensibly affecting the accustomed vend of
the north country coals, long established on the
Coal Exchange.</p>

<p>To the very poor the importance of coal can be
scarcely estimated. Physiological and medical
writers tell us that carbonaceous food is that which
produces heat in the body, and is therefore the
fuel of the system. Experience tells us that this
is true; for who that has had an opportunity of
visiting the habitations of the poor&mdash;the dwellers
in ill-furnished rooms and garrets&mdash;has not remarked
the more than half-starved slop needle-woman,
the wretched half-naked children of the
casually employed labourer, as the dock-man, or
those whose earnings are extorted from them by
their employers, such as the ballast-man, sitting
crouched around the smouldering embers in the
place where the fire ought to be? The reason of
this is, because the system of the sufferer by long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
want of food has been deprived of the necessary
internal heat, and so seeks instinctively to supply
the deficiency by imbibing it from some outward
source. It is on this account chiefly, I believe,
that I have found the ill-paid and ill-fed workpeople
prize warmth almost more than food.
Among the poorest Irish, I have invariably found
them crowding round the wretched fire when they
had nothing to eat.</p>

<p>The census returns of the present year (according
to the accounts published in the newspapers)
estimate the number of the inhabitants
of London at 2,363,141, and the number of inhabited
houses as 307,722. Now if we take into
consideration that in the immense suburbs of the
metropolis, there are branching off from almost
every street, labyrinths of courts and alleys,
teeming with human beings, and that almost
every room has its separate family&mdash;for it takes a
multitude of poor to make one rich man&mdash;we may
be able to arrive at the conclusion that by far the
greater proportion of coals brought into London
are consumed by the poorer classes. It is on this
account of the highest importance, that honesty
should be the characteristic of those engaged in
the vend and distribution of an article so necessary
not only to the comfort but to the very
existence of the great masses of the population.</p>

<p>The modes in which the coals imported into
London are distributed to the various classes of
consumers are worthy of observation, as they unmistakably
exhibit not only the wealth of the
few, but the poverty of the many. The inhabitants
of Belgravia, the wealthy shopkeepers, and
many others periodically see at their doors the
well-loaded waggon of the coal merchant, with two
or three swarthy “coal-porters” bending beneath
the black heavy sacks, in the act of laying in the
10 or 20 tons for yearly or half-yearly consumption.
But this class is supplied from a very
different quarter from that of the artizans, labourers,
and many others, who, being unable to
spare money sufficient to lay in at once a ton or
two of coals, must have recourse to other means.
To meet their limited resources, there may be
found in every part, always in back streets, persons
known as coal-shed men, who get the coals
from the merchant in 7, 14, or 20 tons at a time,
and retail them from &frac14; cwt. upwards. The coal-shed
men are a very numerous class, for there
is not a low neighbourhood in any part of the city
which contains not two or three of them in every
street.</p>

<p>There is yet another class of purchasers of
coals, however, which I have called the ‘very
poor,’&mdash;the inhabitants of two pairs back&mdash;the
dwellers in garrets, &amp;c. It seems to have been
for the purpose of meeting the wants of this class
that the street-sellers of coals have sprung into existence.
Those who know nothing of the decent
pride which often lingers among the famishing poor,
can scarcely be expected to comprehend the great
boon that the street-sellers of coals, if they could
only be made honest and conscientious dealers,
are calculated to confer on these people. “I
have seen,” says a correspondent, “the starveling
child of misery, in the gloom of the evening,
steal timidly into the shop of the coal-shed man,
and in a tremulous voice ask, as if begging a
great favour, for <i>seven pound of coals</i>. The coal-shed
man has set down his pint of beer, taken
the pipe from his mouth, blowing after it a cloud
of smoke, and in a gruff voice, at which the little
wretch has shrunk up (if it were possible) into
a less space than famine had already reduced her
to, and demanded&mdash;‘Who told you as how I
sarves seven pound o’ coal?&mdash;Go to Bill <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> he
may sarve you if he likes&mdash;I won’t, and that’s an
end on ’t&mdash;I wonders what people wants with seven
pound o’ coal.’ The coal-shed man, after delivering
himself of this enlightened observation, has placidly
resumed his pipe, while the poor child,
gliding out into the drizzling sleet, disappeared in
the darkness.”</p>

<p>The street-sellers vend any quantity at the
very door of the purchaser, without rendering it
necessary for them to expose their poverty to the
prying eyes of the neighbourhood; and, as I have
said were the street dealers only honest, they
would be conferring a great boon upon the poorer
portion of the people, but unhappily it is scarcely
possible for them to be so, and realize a profit for
themselves. The police reports of the last year
show that many of the coal merchants, standing
high in the estimation of the world, have been
heavily fined for using false weights; and, did
the present inquiry admit of it, there might be
mentioned many other infamous practices by
which the public are shamefully plundered in this
commodity, and which go far to prove that the
coal trade, <i>in toto</i>, is a gigantic fraud. May
I ask how it is possible for the street-sellers, with
such examples of barefaced dishonesty before their
eyes, even to dream of acting honestly? If not
actually certain, yet strongly suspecting, that they
themselves are defrauded by the merchant, how
can it be otherwise than that they should resort
to every possible mode of defrauding their customers,
and so add to the already almost unendurable
burdens of the poorest of the poor, who
by one means or other are made to bear all the
burdens of the country?</p>

<p>The usual quantity of coals consumed in the
poorest rooms, in which a family resides, is &frac12; cwt.
per week in summer, and 1 cwt. do. in winter,
or about 2 tons per annum.</p>

<p>The street sale of coals was carried on to a considerable
extent during the earlier part of the last
century, “small coalmen” being among the regular
street-traders. The best known of these was Tom
Britton, who died through fright occasioned by a
practical joke. He was a great fosterer of a taste
for music among the people; for, after hawking
his coals during the day, he had a musical gathering
in his humble abode in the evening, to which
many distinguished persons resorted. This is
alluded to in the lines, by Hughes, under Tom
Britton’s portrait, and the allusion, according to
the poetic fashion of the time being made by means
of a strained <span class="lock">classicality:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Cyllenius so, as fables tell, and Jove,</div>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>The trade seems to have disappeared gradually,
but has recently been revived in another form.</p>

<p>Some few years ago an ingenious and enterprising
costermonger, during a “slack” in his own business,
conceived the idea of purchasing some of the
refuse of the coals at the wharfs, conveying them
round the poorer localities of his beat, in his ass- or
pony-cart, and vending them to “room-keepers”
and others, in small quantities and at a reduced
rate, so as to undersell the coal-shed men, while
making for himself a considerable profit. The
example was not lost upon his fraternity, and no
long time had elapsed before many others had started
in the same line; this eventually took so much
custom from the regular coal-shed men, that, as a
matter of self-defence, those among them who had
a horse and cart, found it necessary to compete
with the originators of the system in their own
way, and, being possessed of more ample means,
they succeeded, in a great measure, in driving
the costers out of the field. The success of the
coal-shed men was for a time so well followed
up, that they began by degrees to edge away
from the lanes and alleys, extending their excursions
into quarters somewhat more aristocratic, and
even there establishing a trade amongst those who
had previously taken their ton or half ton of coals
from the “brass-plate merchant,” as he is called
in the trade, being a person who merely procures
orders for coals, gets some merchant who buys
in the coal market to execute them in his name,
and manages to make a living by the profits of
these transactions. Some of this latter class consequently
found themselves compelled to adopt a
mode of doing their business somewhat similar, and
for that purpose hired vans from the proprietors
of those vehicles, loaded them with sacks of coals,
drove round among their customers, prepared to
furnish them with sacks or half sacks, as they
felt disposed. Finally, many of the van proprietors
themselves, finding that business might
be done in this way, started in the line, and, being
in general men of some means, established it as a
regular trade. The van proprietors at the present
time do the greater part of the business, but there
may occasionally be seen, employed in this traffic,
all sorts of conveyances, from the donkey-cart of the
costermonger, or dock labourer, the latter of whom
endeavours to make up for the miserable pittance
he can earn at the rate of fourpence per hour, by
the profits of this calling, to the aristocratic van,
drawn along by two plump, well-fed horses, the
property of a man worth 800<i>l.</i> or 900<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The van of the street-seller of coals is easily
distinguished from the waggon of the regular
merchant. The merchant’s waggon is always
loaded with sacks standing perpendicularly; it is
drawn by four immense horses, and is driven along
by a gaunt figure, begrimed with coal-dust, and
“sporting” ancle boots, or shoes and gaiters, white,
or what ought to be white, stockings, velvet knee-breeches,
short tarry smock-frock, and a huge fantail
hat slouching half-way down his back. The
street-seller’s vehicle, on the contrary, has the coals
shot into it without sacks; while, on a tailboard,
extending behind, lie weights and scales. It is
most frequently drawn by one horse, but sometimes
by two, with bells above their collars jingling
as they go, or else the driver at intervals
rings a bell like a dustman’s, to announce his
approach to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The street-sellers formerly purchased their coals
from any of the merchants along the river-side;
generally the refuse, or what remained after the
best had been picked out by “skreening” or
otherwise; but always taking a third or fourth
quality as most suitable for their purpose. But
since the erection of machinery for getting coals
out of the ships in the Regent’s Canal basin, they
have resorted to that place, as the coals are at
once shot from the box in which they are raised
from the hold of the ship, into the cart or van,
saving all the trouble of being filled in sacks by
coal porters, and carried on their backs from the
ship, barge, or heap, preparatory to their being
emptied into the van; thus getting them at a
cheaper rate, and consequently being enabled to
realize a greater profit.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of inland coals, also, by
the railways, many of the street-sellers have
either wholly, or in part, taken to sell them on
account of the lower rate at which they can be
purchased; sometimes they vend them unmixed,
but more frequently they mix them up with “the
small” of north country coals of better quality, and
palm off the compound as “genuine Wallsend direct
from the ship:” this (together with short weights)
being, in fact, the principal source of their profit.</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that a merchant purchases
in the market a cargo of coals which
turns out to be damaged, very small, or of inferior
quality. In such cases he usually refuses to
take them, and it is difficult to dispose of them in
any regular way of trade. Such cargoes, or parts
of cargoes, are consequently at times bought up by
some of the more wealthy van proprietors engaged
in the coal line, who realize on them a great profit.</p>

<p>To commence business as a street-seller of
coals requires little capital beyond the possession
of a horse and cart. The merchants in all cases
let street-sellers have any quantity of coals they
may require till they are able to dispose of them;
and the street-trade being a ready-money business,
they can go on from day to day, or from week to
week, according to their pre-arrangements, so that,
as far as the commodity in which they deal is concerned,
there is no outlay of capital whatever.</p>

<p>This may be fairly set down as the gross amount
of capital at present employed in the street-sale of
coals.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to ascertain correctly
the amount of coals distributed in this way among
the poorer classes. But I have found that they
generally take two turns per day; that is they
go to the wharfs in the morning, get their vans
or carts loaded, and proceed on their various
rounds. This first turn usually occupies them
till dinner-time, after which they get another load,
which is sufficient to keep them employed till
night. Now if we allow each van to carry two
and a half tons, it will make for all 150 tons per
day, or 900 tons per week. In the same manner
allowing the 160 carts to carry a ton each, it will
give 320 tons per day, or 1920 tons per week, and
the twenty pony carts half a ton each, 40 tons per
day, or 240 tons per week, making a total of 3060
tons per week, or 159,120 tons per annum. This
quantity purchased from the merchants at 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>

at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> per cwt., or 1<i>l.</i> per ton, leaves

<p>The keep of a good horse is 10<i>s.</i> per week; a
pony 6<i>s.</i> Three horses can be kept for the price

<p>The localities where the street-sellers of coals
may most frequently be met with, are Blackwall,
Poplar, Limehouse, Stepney, St. George’s East,
Twig Folly, Bethnal Green, Spitalfields, Shoreditch,
Kingsland, Haggerstone, and Islington. It
is somewhat remarkable that they are almost unknown
on the south side of the Thames, and are
seldom or never to be encountered in the low
streets and lanes in Westminster lying contiguous
to the river, nor in the vicinity of Marylebone,
nor in any place farther west than Shoreditch;
this is on account of the distance from the Regent’s
Canal basin precluding the possibility of their
making more than one turn in the day, which
would greatly diminish their profits, even though
they might get a higher price for their commodity.</p>

<p>It may be observed that the foregoing statement
in figures is rather under the mark than otherwise,
as it is founded on the amount of coals purchased
at a certain rate, and sold at a certain profit,
without taking into account any of the “dodges”
which almost all classes of coal dealers, from the
highest to the lowest, are known to practise, so
that the rate of profit arising from this business
may be fairly supposed to amount to much more
than the above account can show in figures.</p>

<p>I received the following statement from a person
engaged in the street <span class="lock">traffic:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I kept a coal-shed and greengrocer’s shop,
and as I had a son grown up, I wanted to get
something for him to do; so about six years ago,
having a pony and cart, and seeing others selling
coals through the street, I thought I’d make him
try his hand at it. I went to Mr. <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s, at
Whiting’s wharf, and got the cart loaded, and sent
my son round our own neighbourhood. I found
that he soon disposed of them, and so he went on
by degrees. People think we get a great deal of
profit, but we don’t get near as much as they
think. I paid 16<i>s.</i> a ton all the winter for coals
and sold them for a shilling a hundred, and when
I came to feed the horse I found that he’ll
nearly eat it all up. A horse’s belly is not so
easy to fill. I don’t think my son earns much more
now, in summer, than feeds the horse. It’s different
in winter; he does not sell more nor half
a ton a day now the weather’s so warm. In
winter he can always sell a ton at the least, and
sometimes two, and on the Saturday he might sell
three or four. My cart holds a ton; the vans hold
from two to three tons. I can’t exactly tell how
many people are engaged in selling coals in the
street, but there are a great many, that’s certain.
About eight o’clock what a number of carts and
vans you’ll see about the Regent’s Canal! They
like to get away before breakfast, because then
they may have another turn after dinner. There’s
a great many go to other places for coals. The
people who have vans do much better than those
with the carts, because they carry so much that
they save time. There are no great secrets in
our business; we haven’t the same chance of ‘doing
the thing’ as the merchants have. They can mix
the coals up as they like for their customers,
and sell them for best; all we can do is to buy
a low quality; then we may lose our customers
if we play any tricks. To be sure, after that
we can go to parts where we’re not known.
I don’t use light weights, but I know it’s done
by a good many, and they mix up small coals
a good deal, and that of course helps their
profits. My son generally goes four or five miles
before he sells a ton of coals, and in summer
weather a great deal farther. It’s hard-earned
money that’s got at it, I can tell you. My cart is
worth 12<i>l.</i>; I have a van worth 20<i>l.</i> I wouldn’t
take 20<i>l.</i> for my horse. My van holds two tons
of coals, and the horse draws it easily. I send
the van out in the winter when there’s a good
call, but in the summer I only send it out on the
Saturday. I never calculated how much profit I
made. I haven’t the least idea how much is got
by it, but I’m sure there’s not near as much as
you say. Why, if there was, I ought to have
made a fortune by this time.” [It is right I should
state that I received the foregoing account of the
profits of the street trade in coals from one practically
and eminently acquainted with it.] “Some
in the trade have done very well, but they were
well enough off before. I know very well I’ll
never make a fortune at anything; I’ll be
satisfied if I keep moving along, so as to keep
out of the Union.”</p>

<p>As to the habits of the street-sellers of coals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
they are as various as their different circumstances
will admit; but they closely resemble each other
in one general characteristic&mdash;their provident and
careful habits. Many of them have risen from
struggling costermongers, to be men of substance,
with carts, vans, and horses of their own. Some
of the more wealthy of the class may be met with
now and then in the parlours of respectable public
houses, where they smoke their pipes, sip their
brandy and water, and are remarkable for the
shrewdness of their remarks. They mingle freely
with the respectable tradesmen of their own
localities, and may be seen, especially on the
Sunday afternoons, with their wives and showily-dressed
daughters in the gardens of the New
Globe, or Green Dragon&mdash;the Cremorne and Vauxhall
of the east. I visited the house of one of
those who I was told had originally been a costermonger.
The front portion of the shop was
almost filled with coals, he having added to his
occupation of street-seller the business of a coal-shed
man; this his wife and a little boy managed
in his absence; while, true to his early training,
the window-ledge and a bench before it were
heaped up with cabbages, onions, and other vegetables.
In an open space opposite his door, I
observed a one-horse cart and two or three trucks
with his name painted thereon. At his invitation,
I passed through what may be termed the shop,
and entered the parlour, a neat room nicely
carpeted, with a round table in the centre, chairs
ranged primly round the walls, and a long looking-glass
reflecting the china shepherds and shepherdesses
on the mantel-piece, while, framed and
glazed, all around were highly-coloured prints,
among which, Dick Turpin, in flash red coat,
gallantly clearing the toll-gate in his celebrated
ride to York, and Jack Sheppard lowering himself
down from the window of the lock-up house, were
most conspicuous. In the window lay a few
books, and one or two old copies of <i>Bell’s Life</i>.
Among the well thumbed books, I picked out the
<i>Newgate Calendar</i>, and the “<i>Calendar of Orrers</i>,”
as he called it, of which he expressed a very high
opinion. “Lor bless you,” he exclaimed, “them
there stories is the vonderfullest in the vorld! I’d
never ha believed it, if I adn’t seed it vith my
own two hies, but there can’t be no mistake ven
I read it hout o’ the book, can there, now? I
jist asks yer that ere plain question.”</p>

<p>Of his career he gave me the following account:&mdash;“I
vos at von time a coster, riglarly
brought up to the business, the times vas good
then; but lor, ve used to lush at sich a rate!
About ten year ago, I ses to meself, I say Bill,
I’m blowed if this here game ’ill do any longer.
I had a good moke (donkey), and a tidyish box
ov a cart; so vot does I do, but goes and sees von
o’ my old pals that gits into the coal-line somehow.
He and I goes to the Bell and Siven
Mackerels in the Mile End Road, and then he
tells me all he knowed, and takes me along vith
hisself, and from that time I sticks to the coals.</p>

<p>“I niver cared much about the lush myself, and
ven I got avay from the old uns, I didn’t mind it
no how; but Jack my pal vos a awful lushy cove,
he couldn’t do no good at nothink, votsomever;
he died they say of <i>lirium trumans</i>” [not understanding
what he meant, I inquired of what it
was he died]; “why, of <i>lirium trumans</i>, vich I
takes to be too much of Trueman and Hanbury’s
heavy; so I takes varnin by poor Jack, and cuts
the lush; but if you thinks as ve don’t enjoy
ourselves sometimes, I tells you, you don’t know
nothink about it. I’m gittin on like a riglar house
a fire.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Coke.</span></h3>

<p>Among the occupations that have sprung up of
late years is that of the purchase and distribution
of the refuse cinders or coke obtained from the
different gas-works, which are supplied at a much
cheaper rate than coal. Several of the larger gas
companies burn as many as 100,000 tons of coals
per annum, and some even more, and every
ton thus burnt is stated to leave behind two chaldrons
of coke, returning to such companies 50
per cent. of their outlay upon the coal. The distribution
of coke is of the utmost importance to
those whose poverty forces them to use it instead of
coal.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the ten gas companies in and
about the metropolis produce at least 1,400,000
chaldrons of coke, which are distributed to the
poorer classes by vans, one-horse carts, donkey
carts, trucks, and itinerant vendors who carry one,
and in some cases two sacks lashed together on
their backs, from house to house.</p>

<p>The van proprietors are those who, having
capital, contract with the companies at a fixed
rate per chaldron the year through, and supply
the numerous retail shops at the current price,
adding 3<i>d.</i> per chaldron for carriage; thus
speculating upon the rise or fall of the article, and
in most cases carrying on a very lucrative business.
This class numbers about 100 persons, and are to
be distinguished by the words “coke contractor,”
painted on a showy ground on the exterior of their
handsome well-made vehicles; they add to their
ordinary business the occupation of conveying to
their destination the coke that the companies sell
from time to time. These men have generally a
capital, or a reputation for capital, to the extent of
400<i>l.</i> or 500<i>l.</i>, and in some cases more, and
they usually enter into their contracts with the
companies in the summer, when but small quantities
of fuel are required, and the gas-works are
incommoded for want of space to contain the
quantity made. They are consequently able, by
their command of means, to make advantageous
bargains, and several instances are known of men
starting with a wheelbarrow in this calling and
who are now the owners of the dwellings in which
they reside, and have goods, vans, and carts
besides.</p>

<p>Another class, to whom may be applied much
that has been said of the van proprietors, are the
possessors of one-horse carts, who in many instances
keep small shops for the sale of greens, coals, &amp;c.
These men are scattered over the whole metropolis,
but as they do not exclusively obtain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
living by vending this article, they do not properly
belong to this portion of the inquiry.</p>

<p>A very numerous portion of the distributors of
coke are the donkey-cart men, who are to be seen
in all the poorer localities with a quantity shot in
the bottom of their cart, and two or three sacks
on the top or fastened underneath&mdash;for it is of a
light nature&mdash;ready to meet the demand, crying
“Coke! coke! coke!” morning, noon, and night.
This they sell as low as 2<i>d.</i> per bushel, coke
having, in consequence of the cheapness of coals,
been sold at the gas-works by the single sack
as low as 7<i>d.</i>, and although there is here a
seeming contradiction&mdash;that of a man selling and
living by the loss&mdash;such is not in reality the case.
It should be remembered that a bushel of good
coke will weigh 40 lbs., and that the bushels of
these men rarely exceed 25 lbs.; so that it will
be seen that by this unprincipled mode of dealing
they can seemingly sell for less than they give,
and yet realize a good profit. The two last classes
are those who own a truck or wheelbarrow or are
the fortunate possessors of an athletic frame and
broad shoulders, who roam about near the vicinity
of the gas-works, soliciting custom, obtaining ready
cash if possible, but in most cases leaving one sack
on credit, and obtaining a profit of from 2<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>,
4<i>d.</i>, or more. These men are to be seen going
from house to house cleverly regulating their
arrival to such times as when the head of the
family returns home with his weekly wage, and
in possession of ready cash enough to make a
bargain with the coke contractor. Another fact
in connection with this class, many of whom are
women, who employ boys to drag or carry their
wares to their customers, is this: when they fail
through any cause, they put their walk up for sale,
and find no difficulty to obtain purchasers from
2<i>l.</i> to as high as 8<i>l.</i>, 10<i>l.</i>, and 12<i>l.</i> The street-sellers
of coke number in all not less than 1500
persons, who may be thus divided: van proprietors,
100; single horse carts, 300; donkey-cart men,
500; trucks, wheelbarrows, and “physical force
men,” 550; and women about 50, who penetrate to
all the densely-crowded districts about town distributing
this useful article; the major portion of
those who are of anything like sober habits,
live in comfort; and in spite of the opinion held
by many, that the consumption of coke is injurious
to health and sight, they carry on a large and
increasing business.</p>

<p>At the present time coke may be purchased at
the gas factories at 6<i>s.</i> per chaldron; but in winter
it generally rises to 10<i>s.</i>, so that, taking the average,
8<i>s.</i>, it will be found, that the gas factories of
the metropolis realize no less a sum than 560,000<i>l.</i>
per annum, by the <i>coke</i> produced in the course of
their operations. And 4<i>s.</i> per chaldron being
considered a fair profit, it will be found, that
the total profit arising from its sale by the various
vendors is 280,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>It is impossible to arrive with any degree of
certainty at the actual amount of business done by
each of the above-named classes, and the profits
consequent on that business: by dividing the
above amount equally among all the coke sellers,
it will be found to give 186<i>l.</i> per annum to each
person. But it will be at once seen, that the
same rule holds good in the coke trade that has
already been explained in connection with coals:
those possessing vans reaping the largest amount
of profit; the one-horse cart men next; then the
donkey carts, trucks, and wheelbarrows; and, least
of all, the “backers,” as they are sometimes called.</p>

the street-sale of coals it may be estimated as

<p>to be divided among 1710 persons, who compose

<p>The following statement as to the street-sale of
coke was given by a man in good circumstances,
who had been engaged in the business for many
<span class="lock">years:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am a native of the south of Ireland. More
nor twenty years ago I came to London. I had
friends here working in a gas factory, and afther
a time they managed to get me into the work too.
My business was to keep the coals to the stokers,
and when they emptied the retorts to wheel the
coke in barrows and empty it on the coke heap.
I worked for four or five years, off and on, at this
place. I was sometimes put out of work in the
summer-time, because they don’t want as many
hands then. There’s not near so much gas burned
in summer, and then, of course, it takes less hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to make it. Well, at last I got to be a stoker; I had
betther wages thin, and a couple of pots of beer
in the day. It was dhreadful hard work, and as
hot, aye, as if you were in the inside of an oven.
I don’t know how I ever stood it. Be me soul, I
don’t know how anybody stands it; it’s the divil’s
place of all you ever saw in your life, standing
there before them retorts with a long heavy rake,
pullin out the red-hot coke for the bare life, and
then there’s the rake red-hot in your hands, and
the hissin and the bubblin of the wather, and the
smoke and the smell&mdash;it’s fit to melt a man like a
rowl of fresh butther. I wasn’t a bit too fond of
it, at any rate, for it ’ud kill a horse; so I ses to
the wife, ‘I can’t stand this much longer, Peggy.’
Well, behold you, Peggy begins to cry and wring
her hands, thinkin we’d starve; but I knew a
grate dale betther nor that, for I was two or three
times dhrinkin with some of thim that carry the
coke out of the yard in sacks to sell to the poor
people, and they had twice as much money to
spind as me, that was working like a horse from
mornin to night. I had a pound or two by me,
for I was always savin, and by this time I knew
a grate many people round about; so off I goes,
and asks one and another to take a sack of coke
from me, and bein knoun in the yard, and
standin a dhrop o’ dhrink now and thin for the
fillers, I alway got good measure, and so I used
to make four sacks out of three, and often three
out of two. Well, at last I got tired carryin
sacks on me back all day, and now I know I was
a fool for doin it at all, for it’s asier to dhrag a
thruck with five or six sacks than to carry one;
so I got a second-hand thruck for little or nothin,
and thin I was able to do five times as much
work in half the time. At last, I took a notion
of puttin so much every Sathurday night in the
savin bank, and faith, sir, that was the lucky
notion for me, although Peggy wouldn’t hear of
it at all at all. She swore the bank ’ud be broke,
and said she could keep the goold safer in her
own stockin; that thim gintlemin in banks were
all a set of blickards, and only desaved the poor
people into givin them their money to keep it thimselves.
But in spite of Peggy I put the money in,
and it was well for me that I did so, for in a
short time I could count up 30 or 40 guineas
in bank, and whin Peggy saw that the bank
wasn’t broke she was quite satisfied; so one day
I ses to myself, What the divil’s the use of me
breakin my heart mornin, noon, and night, dhraggin
a thruck behind me, whin ever so little a bit
of a horse would dhrag ten time as much as I
can? so off I set to Smithfield, and bought a
stout stump of a horse for 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, and thin wint
to a sale and bought an ould cart for little or
nothin, and in less nor a month I had every
farthin back again in the bank. Well, afther
this, I made more and more every day, and
findin that I paid more for the coke in winther
than in summer, I thought as I had money if I
could only get a place to put a good lot in summer
to sell in winther it would be a good thing; so I
begun to look about, and found this house for
sale, so I bought it out and out. It was an ould
house to be sure; but it’s sthrong enough, and dune
up well enough for a poor man&mdash;besides there’s the
yard, and see in that yard there’s a hape o’ coke for
the winther. I’m buyin it up now, an it ’ill turn
a nice pinny whin the could weather comes again.
To make a long story short, I needn’t call the
king my cousin. I’m sure any one can do well,
if he likes; but I don’t mane that they can do
well brakin their heart workin; divil a one that
sticks to work ’ill ever be a hapenny above a
beggar; and I know if I’d stuck to it myself I’d
be a grate dale worse off now than the first day,
for I’m not so young nor near so sthrong as I
was thin, and if I hadn’t lift it off in time I’d
have nothin at all to look to in a few years more
but to ind my days in the workhouse&mdash;bad luck
to it.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Tan-Turf.</span></h3>

<p>Tan-turf is oak bark made into turf after its
virtues have been exhausted in the tan-pits. To
make it into turf the manufacturers have a mill
which is turned by horse-power, in which they
grind the bark to a considerable degree of fineness,
after which it is shaped by a mould into thin
cakes about six inches square, put out to dry and
harden, and when thoroughly hardened it is fit
for sale and for all the uses for which it is intended.</p>

<p>There is only one place in London or its neighbourhood
where there are tan-pits&mdash;in Bermondsey&mdash;and
there only is the turf made. There are
not more than a dozen persons in London engaged
in the sale of this commodity in the streets, and
they are all of the tribe of the costermongers.
The usual capital necessary for starting in the line
being a donkey and cart, with 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i> to purchase
a few hundreds of the turf.</p>

<p>There is a tradition extant, even at the present
day, that during the prevalence of the plague in
London the houses where the tan-turf was used
in a great measure escaped that awful visitation;
and to this moment many people purchase and
burn it in their houses on account of the peculiar
smell, and under the belief that it is efficacious in
repelling infectious diseases from the localities in
which it is used.</p>

<p>The other purposes for which it is used are
for forming a sort of compost or manure for
plants of the heath kind, which delight in a
soil of this description, growing naturally among
mosses and bogs where the peat fuel is obtained.
It is used also by small bakers for heating their
ovens, as preferable for their purposes, and more
economical than any other description of fuel.
Sometimes it is used for burning under coppers;
and very often for keeping alight during the night,
on account of the slowness of its decomposition
by fire, for a single cake will continue burning
for a whole night, will be found in the morning
completely enveloped in a white ash, which, on
being removed, discovers the live embers in the
centre.</p>

<p>The rate at which the tan turf is sold to the
dealers, at the tan-pits, is from 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> per hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>dred
cakes. Those at 9<i>d.</i> per hundred are perfect
and unbroken, while those at 6<i>d.</i> have been injured
in some way or other. The quality of the article,
however, remains the same, and by purchasing
some of each sort the vendors are able to make
somewhat more profit, which may be, on an average,
about 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> per hundred, as they sell it
at 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>While seeking information on this subject I
obtained the address of a person in <span class="lock">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> mews,
<span class="lock">T&mdash;&mdash;</span> square, engaged in the business. Running
out of the square is a narrow street, which, about
mid-way through, leads on the right-hand side to
a narrow alley, at the bottom of which is the
mews, consisting of merely an oblong court,
surrounded by stables of the very smallest dimensions,
not one of them being more than twelve feet
square. Three or four men, in the long waistcoats
and full breeches peculiar to persons engaged
among horses, were lounging about, and,
with the exception of the horses, appeared to be
the only inhabitants of the place. On inquiring
of one of the loungers, I was shown a stable in
one corner of the court, the wide door of which
stood open. On entering I found it occupied by
a donkey-cart, containing a couple of hundred
cakes of tan-turf; another old donkey-cart was
turned up opposite, the tailboard resting on the
ground, the shafts pointing to the ceiling, while a
cock and two or three draggle-tailed hens were
composing themselves to roost on the front portion
of the cart between the shafts. Within the space
thus inclosed by the two carts lay a donkey and
two dogs, that seemed keeping him company,
and were busily engaged in mumbling and
crunching some old bones. On the wall hung
“Jack’s harness.” In one corner of the ceiling
was an opening giving access to the place above,
which was reached by means of a long ladder.
On ascending this I found myself in a very small
attic, with a sloping ceiling on both sides. In the
highest part, the middle of the room, it was
not more than six feet high, but at the sides it
was not more than three feet. In this confined
apartment stood a stump bedstead, taking up the
greater portion of the floor. In a corner alongside
the fire-place I noticed what appeared to be a
small turn-up bedstead. A little ricketty deal
table, an old smoke dried Dutch clock, and a poor
old woman, withered and worn, were the only
other things to be seen in the place. The old
woman had been better off, and, as is not uncommon
under such circumstances, she endeavoured
to make her circumstances appear better than
they really were. She made the following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My husband was 23 years selling the
tan turf. There used to be a great deal more
of it sold than there is now; people don’t seem to
think so much of it now, as they once did, but
there are some who still use it. There’s an old
lady in Kentish-town, who must have it regularly;
she burns it on account of the smell, and
has burned it for many years: my husband used
to serve her. There’s an old doctor at Hampstead&mdash;or
rather he was there, for he died a few days
ago&mdash;he always bought a deal of it, but I don’t
know whether he burned it or not; he used to
buy 500 or 600 at a time, he was a very good
customer, and we miss him now. The gardeners
buy some of it, for their plants, they say
it makes good manure, though you wouldn’t
think so to look at it, it’s so hard and dry. My
husband is dead three years; we were better off
when he was alive; he was a very sober and
careful man, and never put anything to waste.
My youngest son goes with the cart now; he don’t
do as well as his father, poor little fellow! he’s
only fourteen years of age, but he does very well
for a boy of his age. He sometimes travels 30
miles of a day, and can’t sell a load&mdash;sometimes
not half a load; and then he comes home of a
night so footsore that you’d pity him. Sometimes
he’s not able to stir out, for a day or two,
but he must do something for a living; there’s
nothing to be got by idleness. The cart will hold
1000 or 1200, and if he could sell that every
day we’d do very well; it would leave us about
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> profit, after keeping the donkey. It
costs 9<i>d.</i> a day to keep our donkey; he’s young
yet, but he promises to be a good strong
animal, and I like to keep him well, even if
I go short myself, for what could we do without
him? I believe there are one or two persons
selling tan-turf who use trucks, but they’re
strong; besides they can’t do much with a
truck, they can’t travel as far with a truck
as a donkey can, and they can’t take as much
out with them. My son goes of a morning to
Bermondsey for a load, and is back by breakfast
time; from this to Bermondsey is a long
way&mdash;then he goes out and travels all round
Kentish-town and Hampstead, and what with
going up one street and down another, by the
time he comes home at night, he don’t travel less
than from 25 to 30 miles a day. I have another
son, the eldest. He used to go with his father
when he was alive; he was reared to the business,
but after he died he thought it was useless for
both to go out with the cart, so he left it to the little
fellow, and now the eldest works among horses.
He don’t do much, only gets an odd job now and
then among the ostlers, and earns a shilling now
and then. They’re both good lads, and would do
well if they could; they do as well as they can,
and I have a right to be thankful for it.”</p>

<p>The poor woman, notwithstanding the extraordinary
place in which she lived, and the confined
dimensions of her single apartment (I ascertained
that the two sons slept in the stump bedstead,
while she used the turn-up), was nevertheless
cleanly in her person and apparel, and superior in
many respects to persons of the same class, and I
give her statement verbatim, as it corroborates, in
almost every particular, the statement of the unfortunate
seller of salt, who is afflicted with a
drunken disorderly wife, and who is also a man
superior to the people with whom he is compelled
to associate, but who in evident bitterness of spirit
made this assertion: “Bad as I’m off now, if I
had only a careful partner, I wouldn’t want for
anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Concerning the dogs that I have spoken of as
being with the donkey, there is a curious story.
During his rounds the donkey frequently met the
bitch, and an extraordinary friendship grew up
between the two animals, so that the dog at last
forsook its owner, and followed the donkey in all
his travels. For some time back she has accompanied
him home, together with her puppy, and
they all sleep cozily together during the night,
Jack taking especial care not to hurt the young
one. In the morning, when about to go out for
the day’s work, it is of no use to expect Jack to
go without his friends, as he will not budge an
inch, so he is humoured in his whim. The puppy,
when tired, is put into the cart, and the mother
forages for her living along the way; the poor
woman not being able to feed them. The owner
of the dogs came to see them on the day previous
to my visit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Salt.</span></h3>

<p>Until a few years after the repeal of the duty on
the salt, there were no street-sellers of it. It was
first taxed in the time of William III., and during
the war with Napoleon the impost was 15<i>s.</i> the
bushel, or nearly thirty times the cost of the
article taxed. The duty was finally repealed in
1823. When the tax was at the highest, salt
was smuggled most extensively, and retailed at
4<i>d.</i> and 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> the pound. A licence to sell it was
also necessary. Street salt-selling is therefore a
trade of some twenty years standing. Considering
the vast consumption of salt, and the trifling
amount of capital necessary to start in the business,
it might be expected that the street-sellers would
be a numerous class, but they do not number above
150 at the outside. The reason assigned by a
well-informed man was, that in every part of
London there are such vast numbers of shopkeepers
who deal in salt.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">About one-half of those employed in street salt-selling have donkeys and carts, and the rest use the two-wheeled barrow of the costermonger, to which class the street salt-sellers, generally, belong. The value of the donkey and cart may be about 2<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> on an average, so that 75 of the number possessing donkeys and carts will have a capital among them equal to the sum of</td><td>£168</td><td>15</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The barrows of the remainder are worth about 10<i>s.</i> each, which will amount to</td><td>37</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">To sell 3 cwt. of salt in a day is considered good work; and this, if purchased at 2<i>s.</i> per cwt., gives for stock-money the sum total of</td><td>45</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Thus the amount of capital which may be reasonably assumed to be embarked in this business is</td><td class="total">£251</td><td class="total">5</td><td class="total">0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The street-sellers pay at the rate of 2<i>s.</i> per cwt.
for the salt, and retail it at 3 lbs. for 1<i>d.</i>, which
leaves 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> profit on every cwt. One day with
another, taking wet and dry, for from the nature
of the article it cannot be hawked in wet weather,
the street-sellers dispose of about 2&frac12; cwt. per day,
or 18 tons 15 cwt. per day for all hands, which, deducting
Sundays, makes 5825 tons in the course
of the year. The profit of 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> per cwt. amounts
to a yearly aggregate profit of 6310<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, or
about 42<i>l.</i> per annum for each person in the trade.</p>

<p>The salt dealers, generally, endeavour to increase
their profits by the sale of mustard, and
sometimes by the sale of rock-salt, which is used
for horses; but in these things they do little, the
most profit they can realize in a day averaging
about 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The salt men who merely use the barrow are
much better off than the donkey-cart men; the
former are young men, active and strong, well
able to drive their truck or barrow about from one
place to another, and they can thereby save the
original price and subsequent keep of the donkey.
The latter are in general old men, broken down
and weak, or lads. The daily cost of keeping a
donkey is from 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i>; if we reckon 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> as
the average, it will annually amount to 11<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>
the year, which will reduce the profit of 42<i>l.</i>
to about 30<i>l.</i>, and so leave a balance of 11<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>
in favour of the truck or barrow man.</p>

<p>There are nine or ten places where the street-sellers
purchase the salt:&mdash;Moore’s, at Paddington,
who get their salt by the canal, from Staffordshire;
Welling’s, at Battle-bridge; Baillie, of Thames-street,
&amp;c. Great quantities are brought to London
by the different railways. The street-sellers have
all regular beats, and seldom intrude on each
other, though it sometimes happens, especially
when any quarrel occurs among them, that they
oppose and undersell one another in order to secure
the customers.</p>

<p>During my inquiries on this subject, I visited
Church-lane, Bloomsbury, to see a street-seller,
about seven in the evening. Since the alterations
in St. Giles’s, Church-lane has become one of the
most crowded places in London. The houses,
none of which are high, are all old, time-blackened,
and dilapidated, with shattered window-frames
and broken panes. Stretching across the narrow
street, from all the upper windows, might be seen
lines crossing and recrossing each other, on which
hung yellow-looking shirts, stockings, women’s
caps, and handkerchiefs looking like soiled and
torn paper, and throwing the whole lane into
shade. Beneath this ragged canopy, the street
literally swarmed with human beings&mdash;young and
old, men and women, boys and girls, wandering
about amidst all kinds of discordant sounds. The
footpaths on both sides of the narrow street were
occupied here and there by groups of men and
boys, some sitting on the flags and others leaning
against the wall, while their feet, in most instances
bare, dabbled in the black channel alongside the
kerb, which being disturbed sent up a sickening
stench. Some of these groups were playing cards
for money, which lay on the ground near them.
Men and women at intervals lay stretched out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sleep on the pathway; over these the passengers
were obliged to jump; in some instances they stood
on their backs as they stepped over them, and
then the sleeper languidly raised his head, growled
out a drowsy oath, and slept again. Three or four
women, with bloated countenances, blood-shot
eyes, and the veins of their necks swollen and
distended till they resembled strong cords, staggered
about violently quarrelling at the top of
their drunken voices.</p>

<p>The street salt-seller&mdash;whom I had great difficulty
in finding in such a place&mdash;was a man of
about 50, rather sickly in his look. He wore
an old cloth cap without a peak, a sort of
dun-coloured waistcoat, patched and cobbled, a
strong check shirt, not remarkable for its cleanliness,
and what seemed to me to be an old pair
of buckskin breeches, with fragments hanging
loose about them like fringes. To the covering of
his feet&mdash;I can hardly say shoes&mdash;there seemed to
be neither soles nor uppers. How they kept on
was a mystery.</p>

<p>In answer to my questions, he made the following
statement, in language not to be anticipated
from his dress, or the place in which he resided:
“For many years I lived by the sale of toys, such
as little chairs, tables, and a variety of other little
things which I made myself and sold in the
streets; and I used to make a good deal of money
by them; I might have done well, but when a
man hasn’t got a careful partner, it’s of no use
what he does, he’ll never get on, he may as well
give it up at once, for the money’ll go out ten
times as fast as he can bring it in. I hadn’t the
good fortune to have a careful woman, but one
who, when I wouldn’t give her money to waste
and destroy, took out my property and made
money of it to drink; where a bad example like
that is set, it’s sure to be followed; the good
example is seldom taken, but there’s no fear of
the bad one. You may want to find out where
the evil lies, I tell you it lies in that pint pot, and
in that quart pot, and if it wasn’t for so many
pots and so many pints, there wouldn’t be half so
much misery as there is. I know that from my own
case. I used to sell toys, but since the foreign
things were let come over, I couldn’t make anything
of them, and was obliged to give them up.
I was forced to do something for a living, for a
half loaf is better than no bread at all, so seeing
two or three selling salt, I took to it myself. I buy
my salt at Moore’s wharf, Paddington; I consider
it the purest; I could get salt 3<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> the cwt.,
or even cheaper, but I’d rather have the best. A
man’s not ashamed when he knows his articles
are good. Some buy the cheap salt, of course
they make more profit. We never sell by
measure, always by weight; some of the street
weights, a good many of them, are slangs, but I
believe they are as honest as many of the shopkeepers
after all; every one does the best he can
to cheat everybody else. I go two or three evenings
in the week, or as often as I want it, to the
wharf for a load. I’m going there to-night, three
miles out and three miles in. I sell, considering
everything, about 2 cwt. a day; I sold 1&frac12; to-day,
but to-morrow (Saturday) I’ll sell 3 or 4 cwt.,
and perhaps more. I pay 2<i>s.</i> the cwt. for it, and
make about 1<i>s.</i> a cwt. profit on that. I sold sixpennyworth
of mustard to-day; it might bring me
in 2<i>d.</i> profit, every little makes something. If I
wasn’t so weak and broke down, I wouldn’t
trouble myself with a donkey, it’s so expensive;
I’d easily manage to drive about all I’d sell, and
then I’d save the expense. It costs me 7<i>d.</i> or
8<i>d.</i> a day to keep him, besides other things. I
got him a set of shoes yesterday, I said I’d shoe
him first and myself afterwards; so you see there’s
other expenses. There’s my son, too, paid off the
other day from the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, after a four
years’ voyage, and he came home without a sixpence
in his pocket. He might have done something
for me, but I couldn’t expect anything else
from him after the example that was set to him.
Even now, bad as I am, I wouldn’t want for anything
if I had a careful woman; but she’s a
shocking drunkard, and I can do nothing with her.”
This poor fellow’s mind was so full of his domestic
troubles that he recurred to them again and again,
and was more inclined to talk about what so
nearly concerned himself than on any matter of
business.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Sand.</span></h3>

<p>Two kinds of sand only are sold in the streets,
scouring or floor sand, and bird sand for birds.
In scouring sand the trade is inconsiderable to
what it was, saw-dust having greatly superseded
it in the gin-palace, the tap-room, and the
butcher’s shop. Of the supply of sand, a man, who
was working at the time on Hampstead-heath,
gave the following account:&mdash;“I’ve been employed
here for five-and-thirty years, under Sir Thomas
Wilson. Times are greatly changed, sir; we
used to have from 25 to 30 carts a day hawking
sand, and taking six or seven men to fill them
every morning; besides large quantities which
went to brass-founders, and for cleaning dentists’
cutlery, for stone-sawing, lead and silver casting,
and such like. This heath, sir, contains about
every kind of sand, but Sir Thomas won’t allow
us to dig it. The greatest number of carts filled
now is eight or ten a day, which I fill myself.
Sir Thomas has raised the price from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 4<i>s.</i> a load, of about 2&frac12; tons. Bless you,
sir, some years ago, one might go into St.
Luke’s, and sell five or six cart-loads of house-sand
a week; now, a man may roar himself
hoarse, and not sell a load in a fortnight. Saw-dust
is used in all the public-houses and gin-palaces.
People’s sprung up who don’t use sand
at all; and many of the old people are too poor to
buy it. The men who get sand here now are old
customers, who carry it all over the town, and
round Holloway, Islington, and such parts. Twelve
year ago I would have taken here 6<i>l.</i> or 7<i>l.</i> in a
morning, to-day I have only taken 9<i>s.</i> Fine
weather is greatly against the sale of house-sand;
in wet, dirty weather, the sale is greater.”</p>

<p>One street sand-seller gave the following account
of his <span class="lock">calling:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have been in the sand business, man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
boy, for 40 years. I was at it when I was 12
years old, and am now 52. I used to have two
carts hawking sand, but it wouldn’t pay, so I have
just that one you see there. Hawking sand is a
poor job now. I send two men with that ’ere cart,
and pay one of ’em 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and the other 3<i>s.</i> a day.
Now, with beer-money, 2<i>s.</i> a week, to the man at
the heath, and turnpike gates, I reckon every load
of sand to cost me 5<i>s.</i> Add to that 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for
the two men, the wear and tear, and horse’s keep
(and, to do a horse justice, you cannot in these
cheap times keep him at less than 10<i>s.</i> a week,
in dear seasons, it will cost 15<i>s.</i>), and you will
find each load of sand stands me in a good sum.
So suppose we get a guinea a load, you see we
have no great pull. Then there’s the licence, 8<i>l.</i>
a year. Many years ago we resisted this, and
got Mr. Humphreys to defend us before the magistrates
at Clerkenwell; but we were ‘cast,’ several
hawkers were fined 10<i>l.</i>, and I was brought up
before old Sir Richard Birnie, at Bow-street, and
had to find bail that I would not sell another
bushel of sand till I took out a licence. Soon after
that Sir Thomas Wilson shut up the heath from
us; he said he would not have it cut about any
more, for that a poor animal could not pick up a
crumb without being in danger of breaking its
leg. This was just after we took out our licences,
and, as we’d paid dearly for being allowed to
sell the sand, some of us, and I was one, we waited
upon Sir Thomas, and asked to be allowed to work
out our licences, which was granted, and we have
gone on ever since. My men work very hard
for their money, sir; they are up at 3 o’clock
of the morning, and are knocking about the streets,
perhaps till 5 or 6 o’clock in the evening.”</p>

<p>The yellow house-sand is also found at Kingsland,
and at the Kensington Gravel-pits; but at
the latter place street-sellers are not supplied.
The sand here is very fine, and mostly disposed
of to plasterers. There is also some of this kind
of sand at Wandsworth. In the street-selling of
house-sand, there are now not above 30 men
employed, and few of these trade on their own
account. Reckoning the horses and carts employed
in the trade at the same price as our
Camden-town informant sets on his stock, we have
20 horses, at 10<i>l.</i> each, and 20 carts, at 3<i>l.</i> each,
with 3 baskets to each, at 2<i>s.</i> apiece, making
a total of 236<i>l.</i> of capital employed in the carrying
machinery of the street-selling of sand. Allowing
3<i>s.</i> a day for each man, the wages would
amount for 30 men to 27<i>l.</i> weekly; and the expenses
for horses’ keep, at 10<i>s.</i> a head, would
give, for 20 horses, 10<i>l.</i> weekly, making a total
of 38<i>l.</i> weekly, or an annual expenditure for man
and horse of 2496<i>l.</i> Calculating the sale at a load
per day, for each horse and cart, at 21<i>s.</i> a load,
we have 6573<i>l.</i> annually expended in the purchase
of house or floor-sand.</p>

<p><i>Bird-sand</i>, or the fine and dry sand required
for the use of cage-birds, is now obtained altogether
of a market gardener in Hackney. It
is sold at 8<i>d.</i> the barrow-load; as much being
shovelled on to a coster’s barrow “as it will
carry.” A good-sized barrow holds 3&frac12; bushels;
a smaller size, 3 bushels, and the buyer is also
the shoveller. Three-fourths of the quantity conveyed
by the street-sellers from Hackney is sold
to the bird-shop keepers at 6<i>d.</i> for 3 pecks. The
remainder is disposed of to such customers as
purchase it in the street, or is delivered at private
houses, which receive a regular supply. The
usual charge to the general public is a halfpenny
or a penny for sand to fill any vessel brought to
contain it. A penny a gallon is perhaps an average
price in this retail trade.</p>

<p>A man, “in a good way of business,” disposes
of a barrow-load once a week; the others once a
fortnight. In wet or windy weather great care
is necessary, and much trouble incurred in supplying
this sand to the street-sellers, and again in
their vending it in the streets. The street-vendors
are the same men as supply the turf, &amp;c., for cage-birds,
of whom I have treated, p. 156, vol. i.
They are 40 in number, and although they do not
all supply sand, a matter beyond the strength of
the old and infirm, a few costermongers convey a
barrow-load of sand now and then to the bird-sellers,
and this addition ensures the weekly supply
of 40 barrow-loads. Calculating these at the
wholesale, or bird-dealer’s price&mdash;2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a barrow
being an average&mdash;we find 234<i>l.</i> yearly expended
in this sand. What is vended at 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> costs but
8<i>d.</i> at the wholesale price; but the profit is
hardly earned considering the labour of wheeling
a heavy barrow of sand for miles, and the trouble
of keeping over night what is unsold during the
day.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sellers of Shells.</span></h3>

<p>The street-trade in shells presents the characteristics
I have before had to notice as regards the
trade in what are not necessaries, or an approach
to necessaries, in contradistinction of what men
must have to eat or wear. Shells, such as the
green snail, ear shell, and others of that class,
though extensively used for inlaying in a variety
of ornamental works, are comparatively of little
value; for no matter how useful, if shells are only
well known, they are considered of but little importance;
while those which are rarely seen, no
matter how insignificant in appearance, command
extraordinary prices. As an instance I may
mention that on the 23rd of June there was purchased
by Mr. Sowerby, shell-dealer, at a public
sale in King-street, Covent-garden, a small shell
not two inches long, broken and damaged, and
withal what is called a “dead shell,” for the sum
of 30 guineas. It was described as the <i>Conus
Glory Mary</i>, and had it only been perfect would
have fetched 100 guineas.</p>

<p>Shells, such as conches, cowries, green snails,
and ear shells (the latter being so called from their
resemblance to the human ear), are imported in
large quantities, as parts of cargoes, and are sold
to the large dealers by weight. Conch shells are
sold at 8<i>s.</i> per cwt.; cowries and clams from 10<i>s.</i>
to 12<i>s.</i> per cwt.; the green snail, used for inlaying,
fetches from 1<i>l.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per cwt.; and the ear
shell, on account of its superior quality and richer
variety of colours, as much as 3<i>l.</i> and 5<i>l.</i> per cwt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
The conches are found only among the West India
Islands, and are used principally for garden ornaments
and grotto-work. The others come principally
from the Indian Ocean and the China seas,
and are used as well for chimney ornaments, as
for inlaying, for the tops of work-tables and other
ornamental furniture.</p>

<p>The shells which are considered of the most
value are almost invariably small, and of an endless
variety of shape. They are called “cabinet”
shells, and are brought from all parts of the world&mdash;land
as well as sea&mdash;lakes, rivers, and oceans
furnishing specimens to the collection. The Australian
forests are continually ransacked to bring
to light new varieties. I have been informed
that there is not a river in England but contains
valuable shells; that even in the Thames there
are shells worth from 10<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> each. I have
been shown a shell of the snail kind, found in
the woods of New Holland, and purchased by
a dealer for 2<i>l.</i>, and on which he confidently
reckoned to make a considerable profit.</p>

<p>Although “cabinet” shells are collected from
all parts, yet by far the greater number come
from the Indian Ocean. They are generally collected
by the natives, who sell them to captains
and mates of vessels trading to those parts, and
very often to sailors, all of whom frequently
speculate to a considerable extent in these things,
and have no difficulty in disposing of them as
soon as they arrive in this country, for there is
not a shell dealer in London who has not a regular
staff of persons stationed at Gravesend to board
the homeward-bound ships at the Nore, and sometimes
as far off as the Downs, for the purpose of
purchasing shells. It usually happens that when
three or four of these persons meet on board the
same ship, an animated competition takes place, so
that the shells on board are generally bought up long
before the ship arrives at London. Many persons
from this country go out to various parts of the
world for the sole purpose of procuring shells,
and they may be found from the western coast of
Africa to the shores of New South Wales, along
the Persian Gulf, in Ceylon, the Malaccas,
China, and the Islands of the Pacific, where they
employ the natives in dredging the bed of the
ocean, and are by this means continually adding
to the almost innumerable varieties which are
already known.</p>

<p>To show the extraordinary request in which
shells are held in almost every place, while I was
in the shop of Mr. J. C. Jamrach, naturalist, and
agent to the Zoological Society at Amsterdam&mdash;one
of the largest dealers in London, and to whom I
am indebted for much valuable information on
this subject&mdash;a person, a native of High
Germany, was present. He had arrived in London
the day before, and had purchased on that
day a collection of shells of a low quality for
which he paid Mr. Jamrach 36<i>l.</i>; to this he
added a few birds. Placing his purchase in a box
furnished with a leather strap, he slung it over
his shoulder, shook hands with Mr. Jamrach, and
departed. Mr. Jamrach informed me that the next
morning he was to start by steam for Rotterdam,
then continue his journey up the Rhine to a certain
point, from whence he was to travel on foot
from one place to another, till he could dispose of
his commodities; after which he would return to
London, as the great mart for a fresh supply. He
was only a very poor man, but there are a great
many others far better off, continually coming backwards
and forwards, who are able to purchase a
larger stock of shells and birds, and who, in the
course of their peregrinations, wander through the
greater part of Germany, extending their excursions
sometimes through Austria, the Tyrol, and
the north of Italy. A visit to the premises of
Mr. Jamrach, Ratcliff-highway, or Mr. Samuel,
Upper East Smithfield, would well repay the
curious observer. The front portion of Mr. Jamrach’s
house is taken up with a wonderful variety
of strange birds that keep up an everlasting
screaming; in another portion of the house are
collected confusedly together heaps of nondescript
articles, which might appear to the uninitiated
worth little or nothing, but on which the possessor
places great value. In a yard behind the house,
immured in iron cages, are some of the larger
species of birds, and some beautiful varieties of
foreign animals&mdash;while in large presses ranged
round the other rooms, and furnished with numerous
drawers, are placed his real valuables, the
cabinet shells. The establishment of Mr. Samuel
is equally curious.</p>

<p>In London, the dealers in shells, keeping shops
for the sale of them, amount to no more than
ten; they are all doing a large business, and are
men of good capital, which may be proved by the
following quotation from the day-books of one of
the class for the present year, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides these there are about 20 private
dealers who do not keep shops, but who nevertheless
do a considerable business in this line
among persons at the West End of London. All
shell dealers add to that occupation the sale of
foreign birds and curiosities.</p>

<p>There is yet another class of persons who seem
to be engaged in the sale of shells, but it is only
seeming. They are dressed as sailors, and appear
at all times to have just come ashore after a long
voyage, as a man usually follows them with that
sort of canvas bag in use among sailors, in which
they stow away their clothes; the men themselves
go on before carrying a parrot or some rare bird in
one hand, and in the other a large shell. These
men are the “duffers” of whom I have spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in my account of the sale of foreign birds. They
make shells a more frequent medium for the introduction
of their real avocation, as a shell is
a far less troublesome thing either to hawk or
keep by them than a parrot.</p>

<p>I now give a description of these men, as general
duffers, and from good authority.</p>

<p>“They are known by the name of ‘<i>duffers</i>,’ and
have an exceedingly cunning mode of transacting
their business. They are all united in some secret
bond; they have persons also bound to them,
who are skilled in making shawls in imitation of
those imported from China, and who, according to
the terms of their agreement, must not work for
any other persons. The duffers, from time to time,
furnish these persons with designs for shawls, such
as cannot be got in this country, which, when
completed, they (the duffers) conceal about their
persons, and start forward on their travels. They
contrive to gain admission to respectable houses
by means of shells and sometimes of birds, which
they purchase from the regular dealers, but always
those of a low quality; after which they contrive
to introduce the shawls, their real business,
for which they sometimes have realized prices
varying from 5<i>l.</i> to 20<i>l.</i> In many instances, the
cheat is soon discovered, when the duffers immediately
decamp, to make place for a fresh batch,
who have been long enough out of London to
make their faces unknown to their former victims.
These remain till they also find danger threaten
them, when they again start away, and others
immediately take their place. While away from
London, they travel through all parts of the
country, driving a good trade among the country
gentlemen’s houses; and sometimes visiting
the seaports, such as Liverpool, Portsmouth, and
Plymouth.”</p>

<p>An instance of the skill with which the duffers
sometimes do business, is the following. One of
these persons some time ago came into the shop of
a shell dealer, having with him a beautiful specimen
of a three-coloured cockatoo, for which he
asked 10<i>l.</i> The shell dealer declined the purchase
at that price, saying, that he sold these birds at 4<i>l.</i>
a piece, but offered to give 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for it, which
was at once accepted; while pocketing the money,
the man remarked that he had paid ten guineas
for that bird. The shell dealer, surprised that so
good a judge should be induced to give so much
more than the value of the bird, was desirous of
hearing further, when the duffer made this statement:&mdash;“I
went the other day to a gentleman’s
house, he was an old officer, where I saw this
bird, and, in order to get introduced, I offered to
purchase it. The gentleman said he knew it was
a valuable bird, and couldn’t think of taking less
than ten guineas. I then offered to barter for it,
and produced a shawl, for which I asked twenty-five
guineas, but offered to take fifteen guineas
and the bird. This was at length agreed to, and
now, having sold it for 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, it makes 19<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>
I got for the shawl, and not a bad day’s work
either.”</p>

<p>Of shells there are about a million of the commoner
sorts bought by the London street-sellers at
3<i>s.</i> the gross. They are retailed at 1<i>d.</i> apiece,
or 12<i>s.</i> the gross, when sold separately; a large
proportion, as is the case with many articles of
taste or curiosity rather than of usefulness, being
sold by the London street-folk on country rounds;
some of these rounds stretch half-way to Bristol
or to Liverpool.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the River Beer-Sellers, or Purl-Men.</span></h3>

<p>There is yet another class of itinerant dealers
who, if not traders in the streets, are traders in
what was once termed the silent highway&mdash;the
river beer-sellers, or purl-men, as they are more
commonly called. These should strictly have been
included among the sellers of eatables and drinkables;
they have, however, been kept distinct,
being a peculiar class, and having little in common
with the other out-door sellers.</p>

<p>I will begin my account of the river-sellers by
enumerating the numerous classes of labourers,
amounting to many thousands, who get their
living by plying their respective avocations on the
river, and who constitute the customers of these
men. There are first the sailors on board the
corn, coal, and timber ships; then the “lumpers,”
or those engaged in discharging the timber ships;
the “stevedores,” or those engaged in stowing
craft; and the “riggers,” or those engaged in
rigging them; ballast-heavers, ballast-getters, corn-porters,
coal-whippers, watermen and lightermen,
and coal-porters, who, although engaged in carrying
sacks of coal from the barges or ships at the river’s
side to the shore, where there are public-houses,
nevertheless, when hard worked and pressed for
time, frequently avail themselves of the presence
of the purl-man to quench their thirst, and to
stimulate them to further exertion.</p>

<p>It would be a remarkable circumstance if the
fact of so many persons continually employed in
severe labour, and who, of course, are at times in
want of refreshment, had not called into existence
a class to supply that which was evidently required;
under one form or the other, therefore,
river-dealers boast of an antiquity as old as the
naval commerce of the country.</p>

<p>The prototype of the river beer-seller of the
present day is the bumboat-man. Bumboats (or
rather <i>Baum</i>-boats, that is to say, the boats of the
harbour, from the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Baum</i>, a haven or bar)
are known in every port where ships are obliged to
anchor at a distance from the shore. They are
stored with a large assortment of articles, such as are
likely to be required by people after a long voyage.
Previously to the formation of the various docks
on the Thames, they were very numerous on the
river, and drove a good trade with the homeward-bound
shipping. But since the docks came into
requisition, and steam-tugs brought the ships
from the mouth of the river to the dock entrance,
their business died away, and they gradually disappeared;
so that a bumboat on the Thames at
the present day would be a sort of curiosity, a
relic of times past.</p>

<p>In former times it was <i>not</i> in the power of any
person who chose to follow the calling of a bumboat
man on the Thames. The Trinity Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>pany
had the power of granting licences for this
purpose. Whether they were restrained by some
special clause in their charter, or not, from giving
licences indiscriminately, it is difficult to say.
But it is certain that none got a licence but a
sailor&mdash;one who had “served his country;” and
it was quite common in those days to see an old
fellow with a pair of wooden legs, perhaps blind
of an eye, or wanting an arm, and with a face
rugged as a rock, plying about among the shipping,
accompanied by a boy whose duty it was to carry
the articles to the purchasers on shipboard, and
help in the management of the boat. In the
first or second year of the reign of her present
Majesty, however, when the original bumboat-men
had long degenerated into the mere beer-sellers,
and any one who wished traded in this line
on the river (the Trinity Company having for many
years paid no attention to the matter), an inquiry
took place, which resulted in a regulation that
all the beer-sellers or purl-men should thenceforward
be regularly licensed for the river-sale of
beer and spirits from the Waterman’s Hall, which
regulation is in force to the present time.</p>

<p>It appears to have been the practice at some
time or other in this country to infuse wormwood
into beer or ale previous to drinking it, either to
make it sufficiently bitter, or for some medicinal
purpose. This mixture was called <i>purl</i>&mdash;why I
know not, but Bailey, the philologist of the
seventeenth century, so designates it. The drink
originally sold on the river was purl, or this
mixture, whence the title, purl-man. Now, however,
the wormwood is unknown; and what is
sold under the name of purl is beer warmed nearly
to boiling heat, and flavoured with gin, sugar,
and ginger. The river-sellers, however, still retain
the name, of <i>purl</i>-men, though there is not one of
them with whom I have conversed that has the
remotest idea of the meaning of it.</p>

<p>To set up as a purl-man, some acquaintance
with the river, and a certain degree of skill in
the management of a boat, are absolutely necessary;
as, from the frequently-crowded state of the
pool, and the rapidity with which the steamers
pass and repass, twisting and wriggling their way
through craft of every description, the unskilful
adventurer would run in continual danger of
having his boat crushed like a nutshell. The
purl-men, however, through long practice, are
scarcely inferior to the watermen themselves in
the management of their boats; and they may be
seen at all times easily working their way through
every obstruction, now shooting athwart the bows
of a Dutch galliot or sailing-barge, then dropping
astern to allow a steam-boat to pass till they at
length reach the less troubled waters between the
tiers of shipping.</p>

<p>The first thing required to become a purl-man is to
procure a licence from the Waterman’s Hall, which
costs 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per annum. The next requisite is
the possession of a boat. The boats used are all
in the form of skiffs, rather short, but of a good
breadth, and therefore less liable to capsize through
the swell of the steamers, or through any other
cause. Thus equipped he then goes to some of the
small breweries, where he gets two “pins,” or
small casks of beer, each containing eighteen pots;
after this he furnishes himself with a quart or two
of gin from some publican, which he carries in
a tin vessel with a long neck, like a bottle&mdash;an
iron or tin vessel to hold the fire, with holes drilled
all round to admit the air and keep the fuel burning,
and a huge bell, by no means the least important
portion of his fit out. Placing his two
pins of beer on a frame in the stern of the boat,
the spiles loosened and the brass cocks fitted in,
and with his tin gin bottle close to his hand beneath
the seat, two or three measures of various
sizes, a black tin pot for heating the beer, and his
fire pan secured on the bottom of the boat, and
sending up a black smoke, he takes his seat early
in the morning and pulls away from the shore,
resting now and then on his oars, to ring the
heavy bell that announces his approach. Those
on board the vessels requiring refreshment, when
they hear the bell, hail “Purl ahoy;” in an instant
the oars are resumed, and the purl-man is quickly
alongside the ship.</p>

<p>The bell of the purl-man not unfrequently performs
another very important office. During the
winter, when dense fogs settle down on the river,
even the regular watermen sometimes lose themselves,
and flounder about bewildered perhaps for
hours. The direction once lost, their shouting is
unheeded or unheard. The purl-man’s bell, however,
reaches the ear through the surrounding
gloom, and indicates his position; when near
enough to hear the hail of his customers, he makes
his way unerringly to the spot by now and then
sounding his bell; this is immediately answered
by another shout, so that in a short time the glare
of his fire may be distinguished as he emerges
from the darkness, and glides noiselessly alongside
the ship where he is wanted.</p>

<p>The amount of capital necessary to start in the
purl line may be as follows:&mdash;I have said that the
boats are all of the skiff kind&mdash;generally old ones,
which they patch up and repair at but little cost.
They purchase these boats at from 3<i>l.</i> to 6<i>l.</i> each.
If we take the average of these two sums, the
items will <span class="lock">be&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>
<p>Thus it requires, at the very least, a capital of
6<i>l.</i> to set up as a purl-man.</p>

<p>Since the Waterman’s Hall has had the granting
of licences, there have been upwards of 140
issued; but out of the possessors of these many are
dead, some have left for other business, and others
are too old and feeble to follow the occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
any longer, so that out of the whole number
there remain only 35 purl-men on the river,
and these are thus divided:&mdash;23 ply their
trade in what is called “the pool,” that is, from
Execution Dock to Ratcliff Cross, among the
coal-laden ships, and do a tolerable business
amongst the sailors and the hard-working and
thirsty coal-whippers; 8 purl-men follow their
calling from Execution Dock to London Bridge,
and sell their commodity among the ships loaded
with corn, potatoes, &amp;c.; and 4 are known to frequent
the various reaches below Limehouse Hole,
where the colliers are obliged to lie at times in
sections, waiting till they are sold on the Coal
Exchange, and some even go down the river as
far as the ballast-lighters of the Trinity Company,
for the purpose of supplying the ballast-getters.
The purl-men cannot sell much to the unfortunate
ballast-heavers, for they are suffering under all
the horrors of an abominable truck system, and
are compelled to take from the publicans about
Wapping and Shadwell, who are their employers,
large quantities of filthy stuff compounded especially
for their use, for which they are charged
exorbitant prices, being thus and in a variety of
other ways mercilessly robbed of their earnings, so
that they and their families are left in a state of
almost utter destitution. One of the purl-men,
whose boat is No. 44, has hoops like those used
by gipsies for pitching their tents; these he fastens
to each side of the boat, over which he draws a
tarred canvas covering, water-proof, and beneath
this he sleeps the greater part of the year, seldom
going ashore except for the purpose of getting a
fresh supply of liquors for trade, or food for himself.
He generally casts anchor in some unfrequented
nook down the river, where he enjoys all the quiet
of a Thames hermit, after the labour of the day.
To obtain the necessary heat during the winter, he
fits a funnel to his fire-stove to carry away the
smoke, and thus warmed he sleeps away in defiance
of the severest weather.</p>

<p>It appears from the facts above given that 210<i>l.</i>
is the gross amount of capital employed in this
business. On an average all the year round
each purl-man sells two “pins” of beer weekly,
independent of gin; but little gin is thus sold
in the summer, but in the winter a considerable
quantity of it is used in making the purl. The
men purchase the beer at 4<i>s.</i> per pin, and sell it
at 4<i>d.</i> per pot, which leaves them a profit of 4<i>s.</i> on
the two pins, and, allowing them 6<i>d.</i> per day profit
on the gin, it gives 1<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> per week profit to each,
or a total to all hands of 47<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> per week, and a
gross total of 2457<i>l.</i> profit made on the sale of
98,280 gallons of beer, beside gin sold on the
Thames in the course of the year. From this
amount must be deducted 318<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, which is
paid to boys, at the rate of 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week; it
being necessary for each purl-man to employ a
lad to take care of the boat while he is on board
the ships serving his customers, or traversing the
tiers. This deduction being made leaves 61<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>
per annum to each purl-man as the profit on his
year’s trading.</p>

<p>The present race of purl-men, unlike the
weather-beaten tars who in former times alone
were licensed, are generally young men, who
have been in the habit of following some river
employment, and who, either from some accident
having befallen them in the course of their work,
or from their preferring the easier task of sitting
in their boat and rowing leisurely about to continuous
labour, have started in the line, and ultimately
superseded the old river dealers. This is
easily explained. No man labouring on the river
would purchase from a stranger when he knew
that his own fellow-workman was afloat, and was
prepared to serve him with as good an article;
besides he might not have money, and a stranger
could not be expected to give trust, but his old
acquaintance would make little scruple in doing so.
In this way the customers of the purl-men are
secured; and many of these people do so much
more than the average amount of business above
stated, that it is no unusual thing to see some
of them, after four or five years on the river,
take a public-house, spring up into the rank of
licensed victuallers, and finally become men of
substance.</p>

<p>I conversed with one who had been a coal-whipper.
He stated that he had met with an
accident while at work which prevented him from
following coal-whipping any longer. He had fallen
from the ship’s side into a barge, and was for a long
time in the hospital. When he came out he found
he could not work, and had no other prospect
before him but the union. “I thought I’d
be by this time toes up in Stepney churchyard,”
he said, “and grinning at the lid of an old coffin.”
In this extremity a neighbour, a waterman, who
had long known him, advised him to take to the
purl business, and gave him not only the advice,
but sufficient money to enable him to put it in
practice. The man accordingly got a boat, and
was soon afloat among his old workmates. In
this line he now makes out a living for himself
and his family, and reckons himself able to clear,
one week with the other, from 18<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> “I
should do much better,” he said, “if people
would only pay what they owe; but there are
some who never think of paying anything.” He
has between 10<i>l.</i> and 20<i>l.</i> due to him, and
never expects to get a farthing of it.</p>

<p>Beside the regular purl-men, or, as they may be
called, bumboat-men, there are two or three others
who, perhaps unable to purchase a boat, and take
out the licence, have nevertheless for a number of
years contrived to carry on a traffic in spirits
among the ships in the Thames. Their practice is
to carry a flat tin bottle concealed about their person,
with which they go on board the first ship in
a tier, where they are well known by those who
may be there employed. If the seamen wish for
any spirit the river-vendor immediately supplies
it, entering the name of the customers served, as
none of the vendors ever receive, at the time of sale,
any money for what they dispose of; they keep
an account till their customers receive their wages,
when they always contrive to be present, and in
general succeed in getting what is owing to them.
What their profits are it is impossible to tell,
perhaps they may equal those of the regular purl-man,
for they go on board of almost every ship
in the course of the day. When their tin bottle
is empty they go on shore to replenish it, doing so
time after time if necessary.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that although these people are
perfectly well known to every purl-man on the
river, who have seen them day by day, for many
years going on board the various ships, and are
thoroughly cognizant of the purpose of their visits,
there has never been any information laid against
them, nor have they been in any way interrupted
in their business.</p>

<p>There is one of these river spirit-sellers who
has pursued the avocation for the greater part of
his life; he is a native of the south of Ireland,
now very old, and a little shrivelled-up man.
He may still be seen every day, going from ship
to ship by scrambling over the quarters where
they are lashed together in tiers&mdash;a feat sometimes
attended with danger to the young and strong;
yet he works his way with the agility of a man
of 20, gets on board the ship he wants, and
when there, were he not so well known, he
might be thought to be some official sent to take
an inventory of the contents of the ship, for he
has at all times an ink-bottle hanging from one of
his coat buttons, a pen stuck over his ear, spectacles
on his nose, a book in his hand, and really
has all the appearance of a man determined on doing
business of some sort or other. He possesses a sort
of ubiquity, for go where you will through any part
of the pool you are sure to meet him. He seems
to be expected everywhere; no one appears to be
surprised at his presence. Captains and mates
pass him by unnoticed and unquestioned. As suddenly
as he comes does he disappear, to start up in
some other place. His visits are so regular, that
it would scarcely look like being on board ship if
“old <span class="lock">D&mdash;&mdash;</span>, the whiskey man,” as he is called,
did not make his appearance some time during the
day, for he seems to be in some strange way
identified with the river, and with every ship that
frequents it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_NUMBERS_CAPITAL_AND_INCOME_OF_THE_STREET-SELLERS"></a>OF THE NUMBERS, CAPITAL, AND INCOME OF THE STREET-SELLERS
OF SECOND-HAND ARTICLES, LIVE ANIMALS,
MINERAL PRODUCTIONS, ETC.</h2>

</div>


<p>The hawkers of second-hand articles, live animals,
mineral productions, and natural curiosities, form,
as we have seen, large important classes of the
street-sellers. According to the facts already given,
there appear to be at present in the streets, 90 sellers
of metal wares, including the sellers of second-hand
trays and Italian-irons; 30 sellers of old
linen, as wrappers and towelling; 80 vendors of
second-hand (burnt) linen and calico; 30 sellers of
curtains; 30 sellers of carpeting, &amp;c.; 30 sellers
of bed-ticking, &amp;c.; 6 sellers of old crockery and
glass; 25 sellers of old musical instruments; 6
vendors of second-hand weapons; 6 sellers of old
curiosities; 6 vendors of telescopes and pocket
glasses; 30 to 40 sellers of other miscellaneous
second-hand articles; 100 sellers of men’s second-hand
clothes; 30 sellers of old boots and shoes;
15 vendors of old hats; 50 sellers of women’s
second-hand apparel; 30 vendors of second-hand
bonnets, and 10 sellers of old furs; 116 sellers of
second-hand articles at Smithfield-market;&mdash;making
altogether 725 street-sellers of second-hand
commodities.</p>

<p>But some of the above trades are of a temporary
character only, as in the case of the vendors
of old linen towelling or wrappers, carpets,
bed-ticking, &amp;c.&mdash;the same persons who sell the
one often selling the others; the towels and
wrappers, moreover, are offered for sale only on
the Monday and Saturday nights. Assuming,
then, that upwards of 100 or one-sixth of the
above number sell two different second-hand
articles, or are not continually employed at that
department of street-traffic, we find the total number
of street-sellers belonging to this class to be
about 500.</p>

<p>Concerning the number selling live animals in
the streets, there are 50 men vending fancy and
sporting dogs; 200 sellers and “duffers” of
English birds; 10 sellers of parrots and other
foreign birds; 3 sellers of birds’-nests, &amp;c.; 20
vendors of squirrels; 6 sellers of leverets and
wild rabbits; 35 vendors of gold and silver fish;
20 vendors of tortoises; and 14 sellers of snails,
frogs, worms, &amp;c.; or, allowing for the temporary
and mixed character of many of these trades, we
may say that there are 200 constantly engaged
in this branch of street-commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then of the street-sellers of mineral productions
and natural curiosities, there are 216 vendors of
coals; 1500 sellers of coke; 14 sellers of tan-turf;
150 vendors of salt; 70 sellers of sand;
26 sellers of shells; or 1969 in all. From this
number the sellers of shells must be deducted, as
the shell-trade is not a special branch of street-traffic.
We may, therefore, assert that the number
of people engaged in this latter class of street-business
amounts to about 1900.</p>

<p>Now, adding all these sums together, we have
the following table as to the numbers of individuals
comprised in the <i>first</i> division of the London
street-folk, viz. the street-<span class="lock">sellers:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">1. Costermongers (including men, women, and children engaged in the sale of fish, fruit, vegetables, game, poultry, flowers, &amp;c.)</td><td>30,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">2. Street-sellers of “green stuff,” including water-cresses, chickweed and gru’n’sel, turf, &amp;c.</td><td>2,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">3. Street-sellers of eatables and drinkables</td><td>4,000</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>These numbers, it should be remembered, are
given rather as an approximation to the truth
than as the absolute fact. It would therefore be
safer to say, making all due allowance for the
temporary and mixed character of many branches
of street-commerce, that there are about 40,000
people engaged in selling articles in the streets of
London. I am induced to believe that this is
very near the real number of street-sellers, from
the <i>wholesale</i> returns of the places where the
street-sellers purchase their goods, and which I
have always made a point of collecting from the
best authorities connected with the various
branches of street-traffic. The statistics of the
fish and green markets, the swag-shops, the
old clothes exchange, the bird-dealers, which I
have caused to be collected for the first time
in this country, all tend to corroborate this estimate.</p>

<p>The next fact to be evolved is the amount of
capital invested in the street-sale of Second-hand
Articles, of Live Animals, and of Mineral Productions.
And, first, as to the money employed in
the Second-hand Street-Trade.</p>

<p>The following tables will show the amount of
capital invested in this branch of street-business.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-BUYERS"></a>OF THE STREET-BUYERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>The persons who traverse the streets, or call
periodically at certain places to purchase articles
which are usually sold at the door or within the
house, are&mdash;according to the division I laid down
in the first number of this work&mdash;<span class="smcap">Street-Buyers</span>.
The largest, and, in every respect, the most
remarkable body of these traders, are the buyers
of old clothes, and of them I shall speak separately,
devoting at the same time some space to
the <span class="smcap">Street-Jews</span>. It will also be necessary to
give a brief account of the Jews generally, for
they are still a peculiar race, and street and shop-trading
among them are in many respects closely
blended.</p>

<p>The principal things bought by the itinerant
purchasers consist of waste-paper, hare and rabbit
skins, old umbrellas and parasols, bottles and glass,
broken metal, rags, dripping, grease, bones, tea-leaves,
and old clothes.</p>

<p>With the exception of the buyers of waste-paper,
among whom are many active, energetic, and
intelligent men, the street-buyers are of the lower
sort, both as to means and intelligence. The only
further exception, perhaps, which I need notice
here is, that among some umbrella-buyers, there is
considerable smartness, and sometimes, in the repair
or renewal of the ribs, &amp;c., a slight degree
of skill. The other street-purchasers&mdash;such as the
hare-skin and old metal and rag buyers, are often
old and infirm people of both sexes, of whom&mdash;perhaps
by reason of their infirmities&mdash;not a few
have been in the trade from their childhood, and
are as well known by sight in their respective
rounds, as was the “long-remembered beggar” in
former times.</p>

<p>It is usually the lot of a poor person who has
been driven to the streets, or has adopted such a
life when an adult, to <i>sell</i> trifling things&mdash;such
as are light to carry and require a small outlay&mdash;in
advanced age. Old men and women totter about
offering lucifer-matches, boot and stay-laces, penny
memorandum books, and such like. But the elder
portion of the street-folk I have now to speak of
do not sell, but <i>buy</i>. The street-seller commends
his wares, their cheapness, and excellence. The
same sort of man, when a buyer, depreciates everything
offered to him, in order to ensure a cheaper
bargain, while many of the things thus obtained
find their way into street-sale, and are then as
much commended for cheapness and goodness, as
if they were the stock-in-trade of an acute slop
advertisement-monger, and this is done sometimes
by the very man who, when a buyer, condemned
them as utterly valueless. But this is common to
all trades.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Buyers of Rags, Broken
Metal, Bottles, Glass, and Bones.</span></h3>

<p>I class all these articles under one head, for, on
inquiry, I find no individual supporting himself
by the trading in any one of them. I shall,
therefore, describe the buyers of rags, broken
metal, bottles, glass, and bones, as a body of street-traders,
but take the articles in which they traffic
seriatim, pointing out in what degree they are, or
have been, wholly or partially, the staple of several
distinct callings.</p>

<p>The traders in these things are not unprosperous
men. The poor creatures who may be
seen picking up rags in the street are “street-finders,”
and not buyers. It is the same with the
poor old men who may be seen bending under
an unsavoury sack of bones. The bones have
been found, or have been given for charity, and
are not purchased. One feeble old man whom I
met with, his eyes fixed on the middle of the
carriage-way in the Old St. Pancras-road, and with
whom I had some conversation, told me that the
best friend he had in the world was a gentleman
who lived in a large house near the Regent’s-park,
and gave him the bones which his dogs had done
with! “If I can only see hisself, sir,” said the
old man, “he’s sure to give me any coppers he
has in his coat-pocket, and that’s a very great
thing to a poor man like me. O, yes, I’ll buy
bones, if I have any ha’pence, rather than go
without them; but I pick them up, or have them
given to me mostly.”</p>

<p>The street-buyers, who are only buyers, have
barrows, sometimes even carts with donkeys, and,
as they themselves describe it, they “buy everything.”
These men are little seen in London, for
they “work” the more secluded courts, streets,
and alleys, when in town; but their most frequented
rounds are the poorer parts of the
populous suburbs. There are many in Croydon,
Woolwich, Greenwich, and Deptford. “It’s no
use,” a man who had been in the trade said to
me, “such as us calling at fine houses to know if
they’ve any old keys to sell! No, we trades
with the poor.” Often, however, they deal with
the servants of the wealthy; and their usual
mode of business in such cases is to leave a bill
at the house a few hours previous to their visit.
This document has frequently the royal arms at
the head of it, and asserts that the “firm” has
been established since the year &mdash;&mdash;, which is
seldom less than half a century. The hand-bill
usually consists of a short preface as to the increased
demand for rags on the part of the paper-makers,
and this is followed by a liberal offer to
give the very best prices for any old linen, or old
metal, bottles, rope, stair-rods, locks, keys, dripping,
carpeting, &amp;c., “in fact, no rubbish or lumber,
however worthless, will be refused;” and generally
concludes with a request that this “bill”
may be shown to the mistress of the house and
preserved, as it will be called for in a couple of
hours.</p>

<p>The papers are delivered by one of the “firm,”
who marks on the door a sign indicative of the
houses at which the bill has been taken in, and
the probable reception there of the gentleman who
is to follow him. The road taken is also pointed
by marks before explained, see vol. i. pp. 218 and
247. These men are residents in all quarters
within 20 miles of London, being most numerous
in the places at no great distance from the
Thames. They work their way from their suburban
residences to London, which, of course, is
the mart, or “exchange,” for their wares. The
reason why the suburbs are preferred is that in
those parts the possessors of such things as broken
metal, &amp;c., cannot so readily resort to a marine-store
dealer’s as they can in town. I am informed,
however, that the shops of the marine-store
men are on the increase in the more densely-peopled
suburbs; still the dwellings of the poor
are often widely scattered in those parts, and few
will go a mile to sell any old thing. They wait
in preference, unless very needy, for the <i>visit</i> of
the street-buyer.</p>

<p>A good many years ago&mdash;perhaps until 30 years
back&mdash;<i>rags</i>, and especially white and good linen
rags, were among the things most zealously inquired
for by street-buyers, and then 3<i>d.</i> a pound
was a price readily paid. Subsequently the paper-manufacturers
brought to great and economical
perfection the process of boiling rags in lye and
bleaching them with chlorine, so that colour became
less a desideratum. A few years after the peace
of 1815, moreover, the foreign trade in rags increased
rapidly. At the present time, about 1200
tons of woollen rags, and upwards of 10,000 tons
of linen rags, are imported yearly. These 10,000
tons give us but a vague notion of the real
amount. I may therefore mention that, when
reduced to a more definite quantity, they show a
total of no less than twenty-two millions four
hundred thousand pounds. The woollen rags
are imported the most largely from Hamburg and
Bremen, the price being from 5<i>l.</i> to 17<i>l.</i> the ton.
Linen rags, which average nearly 20<i>l.</i> the ton, are
imported from the same places, and from several
Italian ports, more especially those in Sicily.
Among these ports are Palermo, Messina, Ancona,
Leghorn, and Trieste (the Trieste rags being gathered
in Hungary). The value of the rags annually
brought to this country is no less than
200,000<i>l.</i> What the native rags may be worth,
there are no facts on which to ground an estimate;
but supposing each person of the 20,000,000
in Great Britain to produce one pound of rags
annually, then the rags of this country may be
valued at very nearly the same price as the foreign
ones, so that the gross value of the rags of Great
Britain imported and produced at home, would, in
such a case, amount to 400,000<i>l.</i> From France,
Belgium, Holland, Spain, and other continental
kingdoms, the exportation of rags is prohibited,
nor can so bulky and low-priced a commodity be
smuggled to advantage.</p>

<p>Of this large sum of rags, which is independent
of what is collected in the United Kingdom, the
Americans are purchasers on an extensive scale.
The wear of cotton is almost unknown in many
parts of Italy, Germany, and Hungary; and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the linen in use is coarse and, compared
to the Irish, Scotch, or English, rudely manufactured,
the foreign rags <i>are</i> generally linen, and
therefore are preferred at the paper mills. The
street-buyers in this country, however, make less
distinction than ever, as regards price, between
linen and cotton rags.</p>

<p>The linen rag-buying is still prosecuted extensively
by itinerant “gatherers” in the country, and
in the further neighbourhoods of London, but the
collection is not to the extent it was formerly.
The price is lower, and, owing to the foreign trade,
the demand is less urgent; so common, too, is now
the wear of cotton, and so much smaller that of
linen, that many people will not sell linen rags, but
reserve them for use in case of cuts and wounds,
or for giving to their poor neighbours on any such
emergency. This was done doubtlessly to as
great, or to a greater extent, in the old times, but
linen rags were more plentiful then, for cotton
shirting was not woven to the perfection seen at
present, and many good country housewives spun
their own linen sheetings and shirtings.</p>

<p>A street-buyer of the class I have described,
upon presenting himself at any house, offers to buy
rags, broken metal, or glass, and for rags especially
there is often a serious bargaining, and sometimes,
I was told by an itinerant street-seller, who had
been an ear-witness, a little joking not of the most
delicate kind. For coloured rags these men give
&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound, or 1<i>d.</i> for three pounds; for inferior
white rags &frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound, and up to 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; for the
best, 2<i>d.</i> the pound. It is common, however, and
even more common, I am assured, among masters
of the old rag and bottle shops, than among street-buyers,
to announce 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i>, or even as much
as 6<i>d.</i>, for the <i>best</i> rags, but, somehow or other, the
rags taken for sale to those buyers never are of
the best. To offer 6<i>d.</i> a pound for rags is ridiculous,
but such an offer may be seen at some rag-shops,
the figure <b class="large">6</b>, perhaps, crowning a painting
of a large plum-pudding, as a representation of
what may be a Christmas result, merely from the
thrifty preservation of rags, grease, and dripping.
Some of the street-buyers, when working the
suburbs or the country, attach a similar “illustration”
to their barrows or carts. I saw the
winter placard of one of these men, which he
was reserving for a country excursion as far as
Rochester, “when the plum-pudding time was
a-coming.” In this pictorial advertisement a man
and woman, very florid and full-faced, were on
the point of enjoying a huge plum-pudding, the
man flourishing a large knife, and looking very
hospitable. On a scroll which issued from his
mouth were the words: “From our rags! The
best prices given by &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, of London.”
The woman in like manner exclaimed: “From
dripping and house fat! The best prices given
by &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, of London.”</p>

<p>This man told me that at some times, both in
town and country, he did not buy a pound of rags
in a week. He had heard the old hands in the
trade say, that 20 or 30 years back they could
“gather” (the word generally used for buying) twice
and three times as many rags as at present. My
informant attributed this change to two causes,
depending more upon what he had heard from
experienced street-buyers than upon his own
knowledge. At one time it was common for a
mistress to allow her maid-servant to “keep a
rag-bag,” in which all refuse linen, &amp;c., was collected
for sale for the servant’s behoof; a privilege
now rarely accorded. The other cause was that
working-people’s wives had less money at their command
now than they had formerly, so that instead
of gathering a good heap for the man who called
on them periodically, they ran to a marine store-shop
and sold them by one, two, and three pennyworths
at a time. This related to all the things
in the street-buyer’s trade, as well as to rags.</p>

<p>“I’ve known this trade ten years or so,” said
my informant, “I was a costermonger before that,
and I work coster-work now in the summer, and
buy things in the winter. Before Christmas is the
best time for second-hand trade. When I set out
on a country round&mdash;and I’ve gone as far as
Guildford and Maidstone, and St. Alban’s&mdash;I lays
in as great a stock of glass and crocks as I can
raise money for, or as my donkey or pony&mdash;I’ve
had both, but I’m working a ass now&mdash;can drag
without distressing him. I swops my crocks for
anythink in the second-hand way, and when I’ve
got through them I buys outright, and so works
my way back to London. I bring back what I’ve
bought in the crates and hampers I’ve had to
pack the crocks in. The first year as I started I got
hold of a few very tidy rags, coloured things
mostly. The Jew I sold ’em to when I got home
again gave me more than I expected. O, lord no,
not more than I asked! He told me, too, that he’d
buy any more I might have, as they was wanted
at some town not very far off, where there was a
call for them for patching quilts. I haven’t heard
of a call for any that way since. I get less and
less rags every year, I think. Well, I can’t say
what I got last year; perhaps about two stone.
No, none of them was woollen. They’re things
as people’s seldom satisfied with the price for, is
rags. I’ve bought muslin window curtains or
frocks as was worn, and good for nothink but rags,
but there always seems such a lot, and they weighs
so light and comes to so little, that there’s sure
to be grumbling. I’ve sometimes bought a lot of
old clothes, by the lump, or I’ve swopped crocks
for them, and among them there’s frequently been
things as the Jew in Petticoat-lane, what I
sells them to, has put o’ one side as rags. If
I’d offered to give rag prices, them as I got ’em
of would have been offended, and have thought I
wanted to cheat. When you get a lot at one go,
and ’specially if it’s for crocks, you must make
the best of them. This for that, and t’other for
t’other. I stay at the beer-shops and little inns
in the country. Some of the landlords looks very shy
at one, if you’re a stranger, acause, if the police
detectives is after anythink, they go as hawkers,
or barrowmen, or somethink that way.” [This
statement as to the police is correct; but the man
did not know how it came to his knowledge; he
had “heard of it,” he believed.] “I’ve very
seldom slept in a common lodging-house. I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
rather sleep on my barrow.” [I have before had
occasion to remark the aversion of the costermonger
class to sleep in low lodging-houses.
These men, almost always, and from the necessities
of their calling, have rooms of their own in
London; so that, I presume, they hate to sleep
<i>in public</i>, as the accommodation for repose in
many a lodging-house may very well be called. At
any rate the costermongers, of all classes of street-sellers,
when on their country excursions, resort
the least to the lodging-houses.] “The last round
I had in the country, as far as Reading and Pangbourne,
I was away about five weeks, I think,
and came back a better man by a pound; that
was all. I mean I had 30 shillings’ worth of
things to start with, and when I’d got back,
and turned my rags, and old metal, and things
into money, I had 50<i>s.</i> To be sure Jenny (the
ass) and me lived well all the time, and I bought
a pair of half-boots and a pair of stockings at
Reading, so it weren’t so bad. Yes, sir, there’s
nothing I likes better than a turn into the
country. It does one’s health good, if it don’t
turn out so well for profits as it might.”</p>

<p>My informant, the rag-dealer, belonged to the
best order of costermongers; one proof of this was
in the evident care which he had bestowed on
Jenny, his donkey. There were no loose hairs on
her hide, and her harness was clean and whole,
and I observed after a pause to transact business on
his round, that the animal held her head towards
her master to be scratched, and was petted with a
mouthful of green grass and clover, which the
costermonger had in a corner of his vehicle.</p>

<p><i>Tailor’s cuttings</i>, which consist of cloth, satin,
lining materials, fustian, waistcoatings, silk, &amp;c.,
are among the things which the street-buyers are
the most anxious to become possessed of on a
country round; for, as will be easily understood
by those who have read the accounts before given
of the Old Clothes Exchange, and of Petticoat
and Rosemary lanes, they are available for many
purposes in London.</p>

<p><i>Dressmaker’s cuttings</i> are also a portion of the
street-buyer’s country traffic, but to no great extent,
and hardly ever, I am told, unless the street-buyer,
which is not often the case, be accompanied
on his round by his wife. In town, tailor’s cuttings
are usually sold to the piece-brokers, who
call or send men round to the shops or workshops
for the purpose of buying them, and it is
the same with the dressmaker’s cuttings.</p>

<p><i>Old metal</i>, or <i>broken metal</i>, for I heard one
appellation used as frequently as the other, is
bought by the same description of traders. This
trade, however, is prosecuted in town by the
street-buyers more largely than in the country, and
so differs from the rag business. The carriage of
old iron bolts and bars is exceedingly cumbersome;
nor can metal be packed or stowed away like old
clothes or rags. This makes the street-buyer
indifferent as to the collecting of what I heard
one of them call “country iron.” By “metal”
the street-folk often mean copper (most especially),
brass, or pewter, in contradistinction to the cheaper
substances of iron or lead. In the country they are
most anxious to buy “metal;” whereas, in town,
they as readily purchase “iron.” When the
street-buyers give merely the worth of any metal
by weight to be disposed of, in order to be re-melted,
or re-wrought in some manner, by the
manufacturers, the following are the average
prices:&mdash;Copper, 6<i>d.</i> per lb.; pewter, 5<i>d.</i>; brass,
5<i>d.</i>; iron, 6 lbs. for 1<i>d.</i>, and 8 lbs. for 2<i>d.</i> (a
smaller quantity than 6 lbs. is seldom bought);
and 1<i>d.</i> and 1&frac14;<i>d.</i> per lb. for lead. Old zinc is not a
metal which “comes in the way” of the street-buyer,
nor&mdash;as one of them told me with a laugh&mdash;old
silver. Tin is never bought by weight in
the streets.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the prices I have
mentioned are those given for old or broken
metal, valueless unless for re-working. When an
old metal article is still available, or may be
easily made available, for the use for which it
was designed, the street-purchase is by “the
piece,” rather than the weight.</p>

<p>The broken pans, scuttles, kettles, &amp;c., concerning
one of the uses of which I have quoted
Mr. Babbage, in page <a href="#Page_6">6</a> of the present volume, as
to the conversion of these worn-out vessels into
the light and japanned edgings, or clasps, called
“clamps,” or “clips,” by the trunk-makers, and
used to protect or strengthen the corners of boxes
and packing-cases, are purchased sometimes by
the street-buyers, but fall more properly under the
head of what constitutes a portion of the stock-in-trade
of the street-finder. They are not bought
by weight, but so much for the pan, perhaps so
much along with other things; a halfpenny, a
penny, or occasionally two-pence, and often only
a farthing, or three pans for a penny. The uses
for these things which the street-buyers have more
especially in view, are not those mentioned by Mr.
Babbage (the trunk clamps), but the conversion
of them into the “iron shovels,” or strong dust-pans
sold in the streets. One street artisan supports
himself and his family by the making of dust-pans
from such grimy old vessels.</p>

<p>As in the result of my inquiry among the street-<i>sellers</i>
of old metal, I am of opinion that the street-<i>buyers</i>
also are not generally mixed up with the
receipt of stolen goods. That they may be so to
some extent is probable enough; in the same proportion,
perhaps, as highly respectable tradesmen
have been known to buy the goods of fraudulent
bankrupts, and others. The street-buyers are
low itinerants, seen regularly by the police and
easy to be traced, and therefore, for one reason,
cautious. In one of my inquiries among the
young thieves and pickpockets in the low lodging-houses,
I heard frequent accounts of their
selling the metal goods they stole, to “fences,”
and in one particular instance, to the mistress
of a lodging-house, who had conveniences for the
melting of pewter pots (called “cats and kittens”
by the young thieves, according to the size of
the vessels), but I never heard them speak of any
connection, or indeed any transactions, with street-folk.</p>

<p>Among the things purchased in great quantities
by the street-buyers of old metal are keys. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
keys so bought are of every size, are generally
very rusty, and present every form of
manufacture, from the simplest to the most
complex wards. On my inquiring how such
a number of keys without locks came to be offered
for street-sale, I was informed that there
were often duplicate or triplicate keys to one lock,
and that in sales of household furniture, for instance,
there were often numbers of odd keys
found about the premises and sold “in a lump;”
that locks were often spoiled and unsaleable, wearing
out long before the keys. Twopence a dozen is
an usual price for a dozen “mixed keys,” to a
street-buyer. Bolts are also freely bought by the
street-people, as are holdfasts, bed-keys, and screws,
“and everything,” I was told, “which some one or
other among the poor is always a-wanting.”</p>

<p>A little old man, who had been many years a
street-buyer, gave me an account of his purchases
of <i>bottles</i> and <i>glass</i>. This man had been a soldier
in his youth; had known, as he said, “many ups
and downs;” and occasionally wheels a barrow,
somewhat larger and shallower than those used
by masons, from which he vends iron and tin
wares, such as cheap gridirons, stands for hand-irons,
dust-pans, dripping trays, &amp;c. As he sold
these wares, he offered to buy, or swop for, any
second-hand commodities. “As to the bottle and
glass buying, sir,” he said, “it’s dead and buried
in the streets, and in the country too. I’ve
known the day when I’ve cleared 2<i>l.</i> in a
week by buying old things in a country round.
How long was that ago, do you say, sir? Why
perhaps twenty years; yes, more than twenty.
Now, I’d hardly pick up odd glass in the street.”
[He called imperfect glass wares “odd glass.”]
“O, I don’t know what’s brought about such a
change, but everything changes. I can’t say
anything about the duty on glass. No, I never
paid any duty on my glass; it ain’t likely. I buy
glass still, certainly I do, but I think if I depended
on it I should be wishing myself in the East Injes
again, rather than such a poor consarn of a business&mdash;<span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;n</span>
me if I shouldn’t. The last glass
bargain I made about two months back, down
Limehouse-way, and about the Commercial-road,
I cleared 7<i>d.</i> by; and then I had to wheel
what I bought&mdash;it was chiefly bottles&mdash;about five
mile. It’s a trade would starve a cat, the buying
of old glass. I never bought glass by weight, but
I’ve heard of some giving a halfpenny and a
penny a pound. I always bought by the piece:
from a halfpenny to a shilling (but that’s long
since) for a bottle; and farthings and halfpennies,
and higher and sometimes lower, for wine and other
glasses as was chipped or cracked, or damaged, for
they could be sold in them days. People’s got proud
now, I fancy that’s one thing, and must have everything
slap. O, I do middling: I live by one thing or
other, and when I die there’ll just be enough to
bury the old man.” [This is the first street-trader
I have met with who made such a statement as to
having provided for his interment, though I have
heard these men occasionally express repugnance
at the thoughts of being buried by the parish.] “I
have a daughter, that’s all my family now; she
does well as a laundress, and is a real good sort;
I have my dinner with her every Sunday. She’s
a widow without any young ones. I often go
to church, both with my daughter and by myself,
on Sunday evenings. It does one good. I’m
fond of the music and singing too. The sermon I
can very seldom make anything of, as I can’t hear
well if any one’s a good way off me when he’s
saying anythink. I buy a little old metal sometimes,
but it’s coming to be all up with street
glass-people; everybody seems to run with their
things to the rag-and-bottle-shops.”</p>

<p>The same body of traders buy also <i>old sacking,
carpeting, and moreen bed-curtains and window-hangings</i>;
but the trade in them is sufficiently
described in my account of the buying of rags, for
it is carried on in the same way, so much per
pound (1<i>d.</i> or 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i>), or so much for the lot.</p>

<p>Of <i>Bones</i> I have already spoken. They are
bought by any street-collector with a cart, on
his round in town, at a halfpenny a pound, or
three pounds for a penny; but it is a trade, on
account of the awkwardness of carriage, little
cared for by the regular street-buyers. Men, connected
with some bone-grinding-mill, go round
with a horse and cart to the knackers and
butchers to collect bones; but this is a portion,
not of street, but of the mill-owner’s, business.
These bones are ground for manure, which is extensively
used by the agriculturists, having been
first introduced in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire
about 30 years ago. The importation of bones is
now very great; more than three times as much
as it was 20 years back. The value of the foreign
bones imported is estimated at upwards of 300,000<i>l.</i>
yearly. They are brought from South America (along
with hides), from Germany, Holland, and Belgium.</p>

<p>The men who most care to collect bones in the
streets of London are old and infirm, and they
barter toys for them with poor children; for those
children sometimes gather bones in the streets and
put them on one side, or get them from dustholes,
for the sake of exchanging them for a plaything;
or, indeed, for selling them to any shopkeeper, and
many of the rag-and-bottle-tradesmen buy bones.
The toys most used for this barter are paper
“wind-mills.” These toy-barterers, when they
have a few pence, will buy bones of children
or any others, if they cannot become possessed of
them otherwise; but the carriage of the bones is a
great obstacle to much being done in this business.</p>

<p>In the regular way of street-buying, such as I
have described it, there are about 100 men in London
and the suburbs. Some buy only during a portion
of the year, and none perhaps (except in the way
of barter) the year round. They are chiefly of the
costermonger class, some of the street-buyers however,
have been carmen’s servants, or connected
with trades in which they had the care of a horse
and cart, and so became habituated to a street-life.</p>

<p>There are still many other ways in which the
commerce in refuse and the second-hand street-trade
is supplied. As the windmill-seller for bones, so will
the puppet-show man for old bottles or broken
table-spoons, or almost any old trifle, allow children
to regale their eyes on the beauties of his exhibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The trade expenditure of the street-buyers it is
not easy to estimate. Their calling is so mixed
with selling and bartering, that very probably not
one among them can tell what he expends in
<i>buying</i>, as a separate branch of his business. If
100 men expend 15<i>s.</i> each weekly, in the purchase
of rags, old metal, &amp;c., and if this trade be
prosecuted for 30 weeks of the year, we find
2250<i>l.</i> so expended. The profits of the buyers
range from 20 to 100 per cent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Rag-and-Bottle,” and the “Marine-Store,”
Shops.</span></h3>

<p>The principal purchasers of any refuse or
worn-out articles are the proprietors of the rag-and-bottle-shops.
Some of these men make
a good deal of money, and not unfrequently
unite with the business the letting out of vans
for the conveyance of furniture, or for pleasure
excursions, to such places as Hampton Court.
The stench in these shops is positively sickening.
Here in a small apartment may be a pile of rags,
a sack-full of bones, the many varieties of grease
and “kitchen-stuff,” corrupting an atmosphere
which, even without such accompaniments, would
be too close. The windows are often crowded with
bottles, which exclude the light; while the floor
and shelves are thick with grease and dirt. The
inmates seem unconscious of this foulness,&mdash;and
one comparatively wealthy man, who showed me
his horses, the stable being like a drawing-room
compared to his shop, in speaking of the many
deaths among his children, could not conjecture
to what cause it could be owing. This indifference
to dirt and stench is the more remarkable,
as many of the shopkeepers have been gentlemen’s
servants, and were therefore once accustomed to
cleanliness and order. The door-posts and windows
of the rag-and-bottle-shops are often closely
placarded, and the front of the house is sometimes
one glaring colour, blue or red; so that the place
may be at once recognised, even by the illiterate,
as the “red house,” or the “blue house.” If
these men are not exactly street-buyers, they are
street-billers, continually distributing hand-bills,
but more especially before Christmas. The more
aristocratic, however, now send round cards, and

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I heard that suspicions were entertained that it
was to some of these traders that the facilities
with which servants could dispose of their pilferings
might be attributed, and that a stray silver
spoon might enhance the weight and price
of kitchen-stuff. It is not pertaining to my
present subject to enter into the consideration of
such a matter; and I might not have alluded to
it, had not I found the regular street-buyers fond
of expressing an opinion of the indifferent honesty
of this body of traders; but my readers may
have remarked how readily the street-people have,
on several occasions, justified (as they seem to
think) their own delinquencies by quoting what
they declared were as great and as frequent
delinquencies on the part of shopkeepers: “I
know very well,” said an intelligent street-seller
on one occasion, “that two wrongs can never
make a right; but tricks that shopkeepers practise
to grow rich upon we must practise, just as they
do, to live at all. As long as they give short
weight and short measure, the streets can’t help
doing the same.”</p>

<p>The <i>rag-and-bottle</i> and the <i>marine-store shops</i>
are in many instances but different names for the
same description of business. The chief distinction
appears to be this: the marine-store shopkeepers
(proper) do not meddle with what is a very principal
object of traffic with the rag-and-bottle man,
the purchase of dripping, as well as of every kind
of refuse in the way of fat or grease. The marine-store
man, too, is more miscellaneous in his
wares than his contemporary of the rag-and-bottle-store,
as the former will purchase any of the
smaller articles of household furniture, old tea-caddies,
knife-boxes, fire-irons, books, pictures,
draughts and backgammon boards, bird-cages,
Dutch clocks, cups and saucers, tools and brushes.
The-rag-and-bottle tradesman will readily purchase
any of these things to be disposed of as
old metal or waste-paper, but his brother tradesman
buys them to be re-sold and re-used for the
purposes for which they were originally manufactured.
When furniture, however, is the staple
of one of these second-hand storehouses, the
proprietor is a furniture-broker, and not a marine-store
dealer. If, again, the dealer in these stores
confine his business to the purchase of old metals,
for instance, he is classed as an old metal dealer,
collecting it or buying it of collectors, for sale to
iron-founders, coppersmiths, brass-founders, and
plumbers. In perhaps the majority of instances
there is little or no distinction between the establishments
I have spoken of. The <i>dolly</i> business
is common to both, but most common to the marine-store
dealer, and of it I shall speak afterwards.</p>

<p>These shops are exceedingly numerous. Perhaps
in the poorer and smaller streets they are
more numerous even than the chandlers’ or the
beer-sellers’ places. At the corner of a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
street, both in town and the nearer suburbs, will
frequently be found the chandler’s shop, for the
sale of small quantities of cheese, bacon, groceries,
&amp;c., to the poor. Lower down may be seen the
beer-seller’s; and in the same street there is certain
to be one rag-and-bottle or marine-store shop, very
often two, and not unfrequently another in some
adjacent court.</p>

<p>I was referred to the owner of a marine-store
shop, as to a respectable man, keeping a store of the
best class. Here the counter, or table, or whatever
it is to be called, for it was somewhat nondescript,
by an ingenious contrivance could be pushed
out into the street, so that in bad weather the
goods which were at other times exposed in the
street could be drawn inside without trouble.
The glass frames of the window were removable,
and were placed on one side in the shop, for in
the summer an open casement seemed to be
preferred. This is one of the remaining old trade
customs still seen in London; for previously to
the great fire in 1666, and the subsequent rebuilding
of the city, shops with open casements,
and protected from the weather by overhanging
eaves, or by a sloping wooden roof, were general.</p>

<p>The house I visited was an old one, and abounded
in closets and recesses. The fire-place, which
apparently had been large, was removed, and the
space was occupied with a mass of old iron of every
kind; all this was destined for the furnace of
the iron-founder, wrought iron being preferred for
several of the requirements of that trade. A
chest or range of very old drawers, with defaced
or worn-out labels&mdash;once a grocer’s or a chemist’s&mdash;was
stuffed, in every drawer, with old horse-shoe
nails (valuable for steel manufacturers), and
horse and donkey shoes; brass knobs; glass
stoppers; small bottles (among them a number
of the cheap cast “hartshorn bottles”); broken
pieces of brass and copper; small tools (such as
shoemakers’ and harness-makers’ awls), punches,
gimlets, plane-irons, hammer heads, &amp;c.; odd dominoes,
dice, and backgammon-men; lock escutcheons,
keys, and the smaller sort of locks, especially
padlocks; in fine, any small thing which
could be stowed away in such a place.</p>

<p>In one corner of the shop had been thrown,
the evening before, a mass of old iron, then just
bought. It consisted of a number of screws of
different lengths and substance; of broken bars
and rails; of the odds and ends of the cogged
wheels of machinery, broken up or worn out; of
odd-looking spikes, and rings, and links; all
heaped together and scarcely distinguishable.
These things had all to be assorted; some to
be sold for re-use in their then form; the others to
be sold that they might be melted and cast into
other forms. The floor was intricate with hampers
of bottles; heaps of old boots and shoes; old
desks and work-boxes; pictures (all modern)
with and without frames; waste-paper, the most
of it of quarto, and some larger sized, soiled or
torn, and strung closely together in weights of
from 2 to 7 lbs.; and a fire-proof safe, stuffed
with old fringes, tassels, and other upholstery
goods, worn and discoloured. The miscellaneous
wares were carried out into the street, and ranged
by the door-posts as well as in front of the house.
In some small out-houses in the yard were piles
of old iron and tin pans, and of the broken or
separate parts of harness.</p>

<p>From the proprietor of this establishment I had
the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been in the business more than a dozen
years. Before that, I was an auctioneer’s, and then
a furniture broker’s, porter. I wasn’t brought up to
any regular trade, but just to jobbing about, and
a bad trade it is, as all trades is that ain’t regular
employ for a man. I had some money when my
father died&mdash;he kept a chandler’s shop&mdash;and I
bought a marine.” [An elliptical form of speech
among these traders.] “I gave 10<i>l.</i> for the stock,
and 5<i>l.</i> for entrance and good-will, and agreed
to pay what rents and rates was due. It was a
smallish stock then, for the business had been
neglected, but I have no reason to be sorry for
my bargain, though it might have been better.
There’s lots taken in about good-wills, but perhaps
not so many in my way of business, because we’re
rather ‘fly to a dodge.’ It’s a confined sort of life,
but there’s no help for that. Why, as to my way
of trade, you’d be surprised, what different sorts
of people come to my shop. I don’t mean the
regular hands; but the chance comers. I’ve had
men dressed like gentlemen&mdash;and no doubt they
was respectable when they was sober&mdash;bring two
or three books, or a nice cigar case, or anythink
that don’t show in their pockets, and say, when as
drunk as blazes, ‘Give me what you can for this;
I want it sold for a particular purpose.’ That particular
purpose was more drink, I should say; and
I’ve known the same men come back in less than
a week, and buy what they’d sold me at a little
extra, and be glad if I had it by me still. O, we
sees a deal of things in this way of life. Yes,
poor people run to such as me. I’ve known them
come with such things as teapots, and old hair
mattresses, and flock beds, and <i>then</i> I’m sure
they’re hard up&mdash;reduced for a meal. I don’t
like buying big things like mattresses, though I do
purchase ’em sometimes. Some of these sellers are
as keen as Jews at a bargain; others seem only
anxious to get rid of the things and have hold of
some bit of money anyhow. Yes, sir, I’ve known
their hands tremble to receive the money, and
mostly the women’s. They haven’t been used to
it, I know, when that’s the case. Perhaps they
comes to sell to me what the pawns won’t take in,
and what they wouldn’t like to be seen selling to
any of the men that goes about buying things in
the street.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve bought everythink; at sales by
auction there’s often ‘lots’ made up of different
things, and they goes for very little. I
buy of people, too, that come to me, and of the
regular hands that supply such shops as mine. I
sell retail, and I sell to hawkers. I sell to
anybody, for gentlemen’ll come into my shop to
buy anythink that’s took their fancy in passing.
Yes, I’ve bought old oil paintings. I’ve heard
of some being bought by people in my way as
have turned out stunners, and was sold for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
hundred pounds or more, and cost, perhaps, half-a-crown
or only a shilling. I never experienced
such a thing myself. There’s a good deal of gammon
about it. Well, it’s hardly possible to say anything
about a scale of prices. I give 2<i>d.</i> for an old tin
or metal teapot, or an old saucepan, and sometimes,
two days after I’ve bought such a thing,
I’ve sold it for 3<i>d.</i> to the man or woman I’ve
bought it of. I’ll sell cheaper to them than to anybody
else, because they come to me in two ways&mdash;both
as sellers and buyers. For pictures I’ve given
from 3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> I fancy they’re among the last
things some sorts of poor people, which is a bit
fanciful, parts with. I’ve bought them of
hawkers, but often I refuse them, as they’ve given
more than I could get. Pictures requires a judge.
Some brought to me was published by newspapers
and them sort of people. Waste-paper I buy as
it comes. I can’t read very much, and don’t understand
about books. I take the backs off and
weighs them, and gives 1<i>d.</i>, and 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and 2<i>d.</i>
a pound, and there’s an end. I sell them at
about &frac14;<i>d.</i> a pound profit, or sometimes less, to men
as we calls ‘waste’ men. It’s a poor part of
our business, but the books and paper takes up
little room, and then it’s clean and can be stowed
anywhere, and is a sure sale. Well, the people
as sells ‘waste’ to me is not such as can read, I
think; I don’t know what they is; perhaps they’re
such as obtains possession of the books and what-not
after the death of old folks, and gets them
out of the way as quick as they can. I know
nothink about what they are. Last week, a man
in black&mdash;he didn’t seem rich&mdash;came into my
shop and looked at some old books, and said ‘Have
you any black lead?’ He didn’t speak plain, and
I could hardly catch him. I said, ‘No, sir, I don’t
sell black lead, but you’ll get it at No. 27,’ but
he answered, ‘Not black lead, but black letter,’
speaking very pointed. I said, ‘No,’ and I
haven’t a notion what he meant.</p>

<p>“Metal (copper) that I give 5<i>d.</i> or 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> for,
I can sell to the merchants from 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> the
pound. It’s no great trade, for they’ll often
throw things out of the lot and say they’re not
metal. Sometimes, it would hardly be a farthing
in a shilling, if it war’n’t for the draught in the
scales. When we buys metal, we don’t notice the
quarters of the pounds; all under a quarter goes
for nothink. When we buys iron, all under half
pounds counts nothink. So when we buys by the
pound, and sells by the hundredweight, there’s a
little help from this, which we calls the draught.</p>

<p>“Glass bottles of all qualities I buys at three
for a halfpenny, and sometimes four, up to 2<i>d.</i> a-piece
for ‘good stouts’ (bottled-porter vessels), but
very seldom indeed 2<i>d.</i>, unless it’s something very
prime and big like the old quarts (quart bottles). I
seldom meddles with decanters. It’s very few
decanters as is offered to me, either little or big,
and I’m shy of them when they are. There’s
such a change in glass. Them as buys in the
streets brings me next to nothing now to buy;
they both brought and bought a lot ten year back
and later. I never was in the street-trade in
second-hand, but it’s not what it was. I sell in
the streets, when I put things outside, and know
all about the trade.</p>

<p>“It ain’t a fortnight back since a smart female
servant, in slap-up black, sold me a basket-full of
doctor’s bottles. I knew her master, and he hadn’t
been buried a week before she come to me, and
she said, ‘missus is glad to get rid of them, for they
makes her cry.’ They often say their missusses
sends things, and that they’re not on no account
to take less than so much. That’s true at times,
and at times it ain’t. I gives from 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> a
dozen for good new bottles. I’m sure I can’t
say what I give for other odds and ends; just as
they’re good, bad, or indifferent. It’s a queer trade.
Well, I pay my way, but I don’t know what I clear
a week&mdash;about 2<i>l.</i> I dare say, but then there’s
rent, rates, and taxes to pay, and other expenses.”</p>

<p>The <i>Dolly</i> system is peculiar to the rag-and-bottle
man, as well as to the marine-store
dealer. The name is derived from the black
wooden doll, in white apparel, which generally
hangs dangling over the door of the marine-store
shops, or of the “rag-and-bottles,” but more frequently
the last-mentioned. This type of the
business is sometimes swung above their doors by
those who are not dolly-shop keepers. The dolly-shops
are essentially pawn-shops, and pawn-shops
for the very poorest. There are many articles
which the regular pawnbrokers decline to accept
as pledges. Among these things are blankets, rugs,
clocks, flock-beds, common pictures, “translated”
boots, mended trowsers, kettles, saucepans, trays,
&amp;c. Such things are usually styled “lumber.” A
poor person driven to the necessity of raising a
few pence, and unwilling to part finally with his
lumber, goes to the dolly-man, and for the merest
trifle advanced, deposits one or other of the articles
I have mentioned, or something similar. For an
advance of 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i>, a halfpenny a week is
charged, but the charge is the same if the pledge
be redeemed next day. If the interest be paid at
the week’s end, another 1<i>d.</i> is occasionally advanced,
and no extra charge exacted for interest. If the
interest be not paid at the week or fortnight’s end,
the article is forfeited, and is sold at a large profit
by the dolly-shop man. For 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> advanced,
the weekly interest is 1<i>d.</i>; for 9<i>d.</i> it is 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>;
for 1<i>s.</i> it is 2<i>d.</i>, and 2<i>d.</i> on each 1<i>s.</i> up to 5<i>s.</i>,
beyond which sum the “dolly” will rarely go; in
fact, he will rarely advance as much. Two poor
Irish flower girls, whom I saw in the course of my
inquiry into that part of street-traffic, had in the
winter very often to pledge the rug under which
they slept at a dolly-shop in the morning for 6<i>d.</i>,
in order to provide themselves with stock-money
to buy forced violets, and had to redeem it on
their return in the evening, when they could, for
7<i>d.</i> Thus 6<i>d.</i> a week was sometimes paid for a
daily advance of that sum. Some of these “<i>illicit</i>”
pawnbrokers even give tickets.</p>

<p>This incidental mention of what is really an
immense trade, as regards the number of pledges,
is all that is necessary under the present head of
inquiry, but I purpose entering into this branch
of the subject fully and minutely when I come to
treat of the class of “distributors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>iniquities</i> to which the poor are subject are
positively monstrous. A halfpenny a day interest
on a loan of 2<i>d.</i> is at the rate of 7280 <i>per cent.
per annum!</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Buyers of Kitchen-Stuff, Grease,
and Dripping.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> body of traders cannot be classed as street-buyers,
so that only a brief account is here necessary.
The buyers are not now chance people,
itinerant on any round, as at one period they
were to a great extent, but they are the proprietors
of the rag and bottle and marine-store shops, or
those they employ.</p>

<p>In this business there has been a considerable
change. Until of late years women, often wearing
suspiciously large cloaks and carrying baskets,
ventured into perhaps every area in London, and
asked for the cook at every house where they
thought a cook might be kept, and this often at
early morning. If the well-cloaked woman was
known, business could be transacted without
delay: if she were a stranger, she recommended
herself by offering very liberal terms for “kitchen-stuff.”
The cook’s, or kitchen-maid’s, or servant-of-all-work’s
“perquisites,” were then generally
disposed of to these collectors, some of whom were
charwomen in the houses they resorted to for the
purchase of the kitchen-stuff. They were often
satisfied to purchase the dripping, &amp;c., by the
lump, estimating the weight and the value by the
eye. In this traffic was frequently mixed up a
good deal of pilfering, directly or indirectly. Silver
spoons were thus disposed of. Candles, purposely
broken and crushed, were often part of the grease;
in the dripping, butter occasionally added to the
weight; in the “stock” (the remains of meat
boiled down for the making of soup) were sometimes
portions of excellent meat fresh from the
joints which had been carved at table; and among
the broken bread, might be frequently seen small
loaves, unbroken.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this mode of traffic by
itinerant charwomen, &amp;c., is still carried on, but
to a much smaller extent than formerly. The
cook’s perquisites are in many cases sold under
the inspection of the mistress, according to agreement;
or taken to the shop by the cook or some
fellow-servant; or else sent for by the shopkeeper.
This is done to check the confidential, direct, and
immediate trade-intercourse between merely two
individuals, the buyer and seller, by making the
transaction more open and regular. I did not hear
of any persons who merely purchase the kitchen-stuff,
as street-buyers, and sell it at once to the
tallow-melter or the soap-boiler; it appears all to
find its way to the shops I have described, even
when bought by charwomen; while the shopkeepers
send for it or receive it in the way I
have stated, so that there is but little of street
traffic in the matter.</p>

<p>One of these shopkeepers told me that in this
trading, as far as his own opinion went, there was
as much trickery as ever, and that many gentlefolk
quietly made up their minds to submit to it,
while others, he said, “kept the house in hot
water” by resisting it. I found, however, the
general opinion to be, that when servants could
only dispose of these things to known people, the
responsibility of the buyer as well as the seller
was increased, and acted as a preventive check.</p>

<p>The price for kitchen-stuff is 1<i>d.</i> and 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> the
pound; for dripping&mdash;used by the poor as a substitute
for butter&mdash;3&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 5<i>d.</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Buyers of Hare and
Rabbit Skins.</span></h3>

<p>These buyers are for the most part poor, old, or
infirm people, and I am informed that the majority
have been in some street business, and often as
buyers, all their lives. Besides having derived
this information from well-informed persons, I may
point out that this is but a reasonable view of the
case. If a mechanic, a labourer, or a gentleman’s
servant, resorts to the streets for his bread, or
because he is of a vagrant “turn,” he does not
become a <i>buyer</i>, but a <i>seller</i>. Street-selling is the
easier process. It is easy for a man to ascertain
that oysters, for example, are sold wholesale
at Billingsgate, and if he buy a bushel (as in
the present summer) for 5<i>s.</i>, it is not difficult
to find out how many he can afford for “a penny
a lot.” But the street-buyer must not only know
what to <i>give</i>, for hare-skins for instance, but what
he can depend upon <i>getting</i> from the hat-manufacturers,
or hat-furriers, and upon having a regular
market. Thus a double street-trade knowledge is
necessary, and a novice will not care to meddle
with any form of open-air traffic but the simplest.
Neither is street-buying (old clothes excepted)
generally cared for by adults who have health and
strength.</p>

<p>In the course of a former inquiry I received an
account of hareskin-buying from a woman, upwards
of fifty, who had been in the trade, she told me,
from childhood, “as was her mother before her.”
The husband, who was lame, and older than his
wife, had been all <i>his</i> life a field-catcher of birds,
and a street-seller of hearth-stones. They had
been married 31 years, and resided in a garret
of a house, in a street off Drury-lane&mdash;a small
room, with a close smell about it. The room was
not unfurnished&mdash;it was, in fact, crowded. There
were bird-cages, with and without birds, over what
<i>was</i> once a bed; for the bed, just prior to my visit,
had been sold to pay the rent, and a month’s rent
was again in arrear; and there were bird-cages on
the wall by the door, and bird-cages over the
mantelshelf. There was furniture, too, and
crockery; and a vile oil painting of “still life;”
but an eye used to the furniture in the rooms of
the poor could at once perceive that there was not
<i>one</i> article which could be sold to a broker or
marine-store dealer, or pledged at a pawn-shop.
I was told the man and woman both drank hard.
The woman <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve sold hareskins all my life, sir, and was
born in London; but when hareskins isn’t in,
I sells flowers. I goes about now (in November)
for my skins every day, wet or dry, and all day
long&mdash;that is, till it’s dark. To-day I’ve not
laid out a penny, but then it’s been such a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
for rain. I reckon that if I gets hold of eighteen
hare and rabbit skins in a day, that is my greatest
day’s work. I gives 2<i>d.</i> for good hares, what’s
not riddled much, and sells them all for 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> I sells
what I pick up, by the twelve or the twenty, if
I can afford to keep them by me till that number’s
gathered, to a Jew. I don’t know what is
done with them. I can’t tell you just what use
they’re for&mdash;something about hats.” [The Jew
was no doubt a hat-furrier, or supplying a hat-furrier.]
“Jews gives us better prices than
Christians, and buys readier; so I find. Last
week I sold all I bought for 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I take
some weeks as much as 8<i>s.</i> for what I pick
up, and if I could get that every week I should
think myself a lady. The profit left me a clear
half-crown. There’s no difference in any perticler
year&mdash;only that things gets worse. The
game laws, as far as I knows, hasn’t made no
difference in my trade. Indeed, I can’t say I
knows anything about game laws at all, or hears
anything consarning ’em. I goes along the squares
and streets. I buys most at gentlemen’s houses.
We never calls at hotels. The servants, and the
women that chars, and washes, and jobs, manages
it there. Hareskins is in&mdash;leastways I c’lects
them&mdash;from September to the end of March,
when hares, they says, goes mad. I can’t say
what I makes one week with another&mdash;perhaps
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> may be cleared every week.”</p>

<p>These buyers go regular rounds, carrying the
skins in their hands, and crying, “Any hareskins,
cook? Hareskins.” It is for the most
part a winter trade; but some collect the skins
all the year round, as the hares are now vended
the year through; but by far the most are
gathered in the winter. Grouse may not be
killed excepting from the 12th, and black-game
from the 20th of August to the 10th of December;
partridges from the 1st of September to
the 1st of February; while the pheasant suffers
a shorter season of slaughter, from the 1st of
October to the 1st of February; but there is no
time restriction as to the killing of hares or of
rabbits, though custom causes a cessation for a
few months.</p>

<p>A lame man, apparently between 50 and 60,
with a knowing look, gave me the following account.
When I saw him he was carrying a few
tins, chiefly small dripping-pans, under his arm,
which he offered for sale as he went his round
collecting hare and rabbit skins, of which he carried
but one. He had been in the streets all his life,
as his mother&mdash;he never knew any father&mdash;was a
rag-gatherer, and at the same time a street-seller
of the old brimstone matches and papers of pins.
My informant assisted his mother to make and
then to sell the matches. On her last illness she
was received into St. Giles’s workhouse, her son
supporting himself out of it; she had been dead
many years. He could not read, and had never
been in a church or chapel in his life. “He had
been married,” he said, “for about a dozen years,
and had a very good wife,” who was also a street-trader
until her death; but “we didn’t go to church
or anywhere to be married,” he told me, in reply to
my question, “for we really couldn’t afford to pay
the parson, and so we took one another’s words.
If it’s so good to go to church for being married,
it oughtn’t to cost a poor man nothing; he
shouldn’t be charged for being good. I doesn’t
do any business in town, but has my regular
rounds. This is my Kentish and Camden-town
day. I buys most from the servants at the bettermost
houses, and I’d rather buy of them than
the missusses, for some missusses sells their own
skins, and they often want a deal for ’em. Why,
just arter last Christmas, a young lady in that
there house (pointing to it), after ordering me
round to the back-door, came to me with two
hareskins. They certainly was fine skins&mdash;werry
fine. I said I’d give 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> ‘Come now, my
good man,’ says she,” and the man mimicked her
voice, “‘let me have no nonsense. I can’t be
deceived any longer, either by you or my servants;
so give me 8<i>d.</i>, and go about your business.’
Well, I went about my business; and a
woman called to buy them, and offered 4<i>d.</i> for
the two, and the lady was so wild, the servant
told me arter; howsomever she only got 4<i>d.</i> at last.
She’s a regular screw, but a fine-dressed one. I
don’t know that there’s been any change in my
business since hares was sold in the shops. If
there’s more skins to sell, there’s more poor
people to buy. I never tasted hares’ flesh in my
life, though I’ve gathered so many of their skins.
I’ve smelt it when they’ve been roasting them
where I’ve called, but don’t think I could eat
any. I live on bread and butter and tea, or
milk sometimes in hot weather, and get a bite of
fried fish or anything when I’m out, and a drop
of beer and a smoke when I get home, if I can
afford it. I don’t smoke in my own place, I uses
a beer-shop. I pay 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for a small
room; I want little but a bed in it, and have my
own. I owe three weeks’ rent now; but I do
best both with tins and hareskins in the cold
weather. Monday’s my best day. O, as to rabbit-skins,
I do werry little in them. Them as
sells them gets the skins. Still there <i>is</i> a few to
be picked up; such as them as has been sent
as presents from the country. Good rabbit-skins
is about the same price as hares, or perhaps
a halfpenny lower, take them all through. I
generally clears 6<i>d.</i> a dozen on my hare and
rabbit-skins, and sometimes 8<i>d.</i> Yes, I should
say that for about eight months I gathers four
dozen every week, often five dozen. I suppose I
make 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> a week all the year, with one
thing or other, and a lame man can’t do wonders.
I never begged in my life, but I’ve twice had
help from the parish, and that only when I was
very bad (ill). O, I suppose I shall end in the
great house.”</p>

<p>There are, as closely as I can ascertain, at
least 50 persons buying skins in the street; and
calculating that each collects 50 skins weekly for
32 weeks of the year, we find 80,000 to be the
total. This is a reasonable computation, for there
are upwards of 102,000 hares consigned yearly
to Newgate and Leadenhall markets; while the
rabbits sold yearly in London amount to about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
1,000,000; but, as I have shown, very few of
their skins are disposed of to street-buyers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Buyers of Waste (Paper).</span></h3>

<p>Beyond all others the street-purchase of waste
paper is the most curious of any in the hands of
the class I now treat of. Some may have formed
the notion that waste paper is merely that which
is soiled or torn, or old numbers of newspapers, or
other periodical publications; but this is merely a
portion of the trade, as the subsequent account
will show.</p>

<p>The men engaged in this business have not
unfrequently an apartment, or a large closet, or
recess, for the reception of their purchases of paper.
They collect their paper street by street, calling
upon every publisher, coffee-shop keeper, printer,
or publican (but rarely on a publican), who may
be a seller of “waste.” I heard the refuse paper
called nothing but “waste” after the general
elliptical fashion. Attorneys’ offices are often
visited by these buyers, as are the offices of public
men, such as tax or rate collectors, generally.</p>

<p>One man told me that until about ten years
ago, and while he was a youth, he was employed
by a relation in the trade to carry out
waste paper sold to, or ordered by cheesemongers,
&amp;c., but that he never “collected,” or bought
paper himself. At last he thought he would
start on his own account, and the first person he
called upon, he said, was a rich landlady, not far
from Hungerford-market, whom he saw sometimes
at her bar, and who was always very civil. He
took an opportunity to ask her if she “happened
to have any waste in the house, or would have
any in a week or so?” Seeing the landlady look
surprised and not very well pleased at what certainly
appeared an impertinent inquiry, he hastened
to explain that he meant old newspapers, or
anything that way, which he would be glad to
buy at so much a pound. The landlady however
took in but one daily and one weekly paper (both
sent into the country when a day or so old), and
having had no dealings with men of my informant’s
avocation, could not understand his object in
putting such questions.</p>

<p>Every kind of paper is purchased by the
“waste-men.” One of these dealers said to me:
“I’ve often in my time ‘cleared out’ a lawyer’s
office. I’ve bought old briefs, and other law
papers, and ‘forms’ that weren’t the regular forms
then, and any <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> thing they had in my line.
You’ll excuse me, sir, but I couldn’t help thinking
what a lot of misery was caused, perhaps, by the
cwts. of waste I’ve bought at such places. If my
father hadn’t got mixed up with law he wouldn’t
have been ruined, and his children wouldn’t have
had such a hard fight of it; so I hate law. All
that happened when I was a child, and I never
understood the rights or the wrongs of it, and
don’t like to think of people that’s so foolish. I
gave 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound for all I bought at the lawyers,
and done pretty well with it, but very likely
that’s the only good turn such paper ever did
any one&mdash;unless it were the lawyers themselves.”</p>

<p>The waste-dealers do not confine their purchases
to the tradesmen I have mentioned. They buy
of any one, and sometimes act as middlemen or
brokers. For instance, many small stationers and
newsvendors, sometimes tobacconists in no extensive
way of trade, sometimes chandlers, announce
by a bill in their windows, “Waste Paper Bought
and Sold in any Quantity,” while more frequently
perhaps the trade is carried on, as an understood
part of these small shopmen’s business, without
any announcement. Thus the shop-buyers have
much miscellaneous waste brought to them, and
perhaps for only some particular kind have they a
demand by their retail customers. The regular
itinerant waste dealer then calls and “clears out
everything” the “everything” being not an unmeaning
word. One man, who “did largely in
waste,” at my request endeavoured to enumerate
all the kinds of paper he had purchased as waste,
and the packages of paper he showed me, ready
for delivery to his customers on the following day,
confirmed all he said as he opened them and
showed me of what they were composed. He had
dealt, he said&mdash;and he took great pains and great
interest in the inquiry, as one very curious, and
was a respectable and intelligent man&mdash;in “books
on <i>every</i> subject” [I give his own words] “on which
a book can be written.” After a little consideration
he added: “Well, perhaps <i>every</i> subject is a
wide range; but if there are any exceptions, it’s
on subjects not known to a busy man like me,
who is occupied from morning till night every
week day. The only worldly labour I do on a
Sunday is to take my family’s dinner to the bake-house,
bring it home after chapel, and read <i>Lloyd’s
Weekly</i>. I’ve had Bibles&mdash;the backs are taken off
in the waste trade, or it wouldn’t be fair weight&mdash;Testaments,
Prayer-books, Companions to the Altar,
and Sermons and religious works. Yes, I’ve
had the Roman Catholic books, as is used in their
public worship&mdash;at least so I suppose, for I never
was in a Roman Catholic chapel. Well, it’s hard
to say about proportions, but in my opinion, as
far as it’s good for anything, I’ve not had <i>them</i>
in anything like the proportion that I’ve had
Prayer-books, and Watts’ and Wesley’s hymns.
More shame; but you see, sir, perhaps a godly
old man dies, and those that follow him care nothing
for hymn-books, and so they come to such as me,
for they’re so cheap now they’re not to be sold
second-hand at all, I fancy. I’ve dealt in tragedies
and comedies, old and new, cut and uncut&mdash;they’re
best uncut, for you can make them into sheets
then&mdash;and farces, and books of the opera. I’ve
had scientific and medical works of every possible
kind, and histories, and travels, and lives, and
memoirs. I needn’t go through them&mdash;everything,
from a needle to an anchor, as the saying
is. Poetry, ay, many a hundred weight; Latin
and Greek (sometimes), and French, and other
foreign languages. Well now, sir, as you mention
it, I think I never <i>did</i> have a Hebrew work; I
think not, and I know the Hebrew letters when I
see them. Black letter, not once in a couple of
years; no, nor in three or four years, when I
think of it. I have met with it, but I always take
anything I’ve got that way to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bookseller, who uses a poor man well. Don’t you
think, sir, I’m complaining of poverty; though
I have been very poor, when I was recovering
from cholera at the first break-out of it, and I’m
anything but rich now. Pamphlets I’ve had by
the ton, in my time; I think we should both be
tired if I could go through all they were about.
Very many were religious, more’s the pity. I’ve
heard of a page round a quarter of cheese, though,
touching a man’s heart.”</p>

<p>In corroboration of my informant’s statement, I
may mention that in the course of my inquiry into
the condition of the fancy cabinet-makers of the
metropolis, one elderly and very intelligent man,
a first-rate artisan in skill, told me he had been so
reduced in the world by the underselling of slop-masters
(called “butchers” or “slaughterers,” by
the workmen in the trade), that though in his
youth he could take in the <i>News</i> and <i>Examiner</i>
papers (each he believed 9<i>d.</i> at that time, but was
not certain), he could afford, and enjoyed, no reading
when I saw him last autumn, beyond the
book-leaves in which he received his quarter of
cheese, his small piece of bacon or fresh meat, or
his saveloys; and his wife schemed to go to the
shops who “wrapped up their things from books,”
in order that he might have something to read
after his day’s work.</p>

<p>My informant went on with his specification:
“Missionary papers of all kinds. Parliamentary
papers, but not so often new ones, very largely.
Railway prospectuses, with plans to some of them,
nice engravings; and the same with other joint-stock
companies. Children’s copy-books, and
cyphering-books. Old account-books of every kind.
A good many years ago, I had some that must
have belonged to a West End perfumer, there was
such French items for Lady this, or the Honourable
Captain that. I remember there was an
Hon. Capt. G., and almost at every second page
was ‘100 tooth-picks, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>’ I think it was
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; in arranging this sort of waste one now
and then gives a glance to it. Dictionaries of every
sort, I’ve had, but not so commonly. Music
books, lots of them. Manuscripts, but only if
they’re rather old; well, 20 or 30 years or so:
I call that old. Letters on every possible subject,
but not, in my experience, any very modern ones.
An old man dies, you see, and his papers are sold
off, letters and all; that’s the way; get rid of
all the old rubbish, as soon as the old boy’s
pointing his toes to the sky. What’s old letters
worth, when the writers are dead and buried?
why, perhaps 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound, and it’s a rattling
big letter that will weigh half-an-ounce. O, it’s
a queer trade, but there’s many worse.”</p>

<p>The letters which I saw in another waste-dealer’s
possession were 45 in number, a small
collection, I was told; for the most part they were
very dull and common-place. Among them,
however, was the following, in an elegant, and
I presume a female hand, but not in the modern
fashionable style of handwriting. The letter
is evidently old, the address is of West-end
gentility, but I leave out name and other <span class="lock">particularities:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; [it is not easy to judge whether the
flourished letters are ‘Mrs.’ or ‘Miss,’ but certainly
more like ‘Mrs.’] Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; (Zoological Artist) presents
her compliments to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and being commissioned
to communicate with a gentleman of the name, recently
arrived at Charing-cross, and presumed by description

<p>“Monday Morn. for the aftn., at home.”</p></div></div>

<p>Among the books destined to a butcher, I
found three perfect numbers of a sixpenny periodical,
published a few years back. Three, or
rather two and a half, numbers of a shilling
periodical, with “coloured engravings of the
fashions.” Two (imperfect) volumes of French
Plays, an excellent edition; among the plays
were <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Athalie</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Iphigénie</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Phèdre</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Frères
Ennemis</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alexandre</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Andromaque</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Plaideurs</span>,
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esther</span>. A music sheet, headed “A
lonely thing I would not be.” A few pages
of what seems to have been a book of tales:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Album d’un Sourd-Muet</span>” (36 pages in the
pamphlet form, quite new). All these constituted
about twopennyworth to the butcher. Notwithstanding
the variety of sources from which the
supply is derived, I heard from several quarters
that “waste never was so scarce” as at present;
it was hardly to be had at all.</p>

<p>The purchasers of the waste-paper from the
collectors are cheesemongers, buttermen, butchers,
fishmongers, poulterers, pork and sausage-sellers,
sweet-stuff-sellers, tobacconists, chandlers&mdash;and
indeed all who sell provisions or such luxuries as
I have mentioned in retail. Some of the wholesale
provision houses buy very largely and sell the
waste again to their customers, who pay more for
it by such a medium of purchase, but they have
it thus on credit. Any retail trader in provisions
at all “in a large way,” will readily buy six or
seven cwt. at a time. The price given by them
varies from 1&frac14;<i>d.</i> to 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> the pound, but it is very
rarely either so low or so high. The average price
may be taken at 18<i>s.</i> the cwt., which is not quite
2<i>d.</i> a pound, and at this rate I learn from the
best-informed parties there are twelve tons sold
weekly, or 1624 tons yearly (1,397,760 lbs.), at
the cost of 11,232<i>l.</i> One man in the trade was
confident the value of the waste paper sold could
not be less than 12,000<i>l.</i> in a year.</p>

<p>There are about 60 men in this trade, nearly
50 of whom live entirely, as it was described to
me, “by their waste,” and bring up their families
upon it. The others unite some other avocation
with it. The earnings of the regular collectors
vary from 15<i>s.</i> weekly to 35<i>s.</i> accordingly as they
meet with a supply on favourable terms, or, as they
call it, “a good pull in a lot of waste.” They
usually reside in a private room with a recess, or
a second room, in which they sort, pack, and keep
their paper.</p>

<p>One of these traders told me that he was
satisfied that stolen paper seldom found its way,
directly, into the collectors’ hands, “particularly
publisher’s paper,” he added. “Why, not long
since there was a lot of sheets stolen from Alder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>man
Kelly’s warehouse, and the thief didn’t take
them to a waste dealer; he knew better. He
took them, sir, to a tradesman in a large respectable
way over the water&mdash;a man that uses great
lots of waste&mdash;and sold them at just what was
handed to him: I suppose no questions asked.
The thief was tried and convicted, but nothing
was done to the buyer.”</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the waste-paper
used by the London tradesmen costs no more than
12,000<i>l.</i> in a year. A large quantity is bought
direct by butchers and others from poor persons
going to them with a small quantity of their
own accumulating, or with such things as copy-books.</p>




<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Buyers of Umbrellas
and Parasols.</span></h3>

<p>The street-traders in old umbrellas and parasols
are numerous, but the buying is but one part, and
the least skilled part, of the business. Men, some
tolerably well-dressed, some swarthy-looking, like
gipsies, and some with a vagabond aspect, may be
seen in all quarters of the town and suburbs,
carrying a few ragged-looking umbrellas, or the
sticks or ribs of umbrellas, under their arms, and
crying “Umbrellas to mend,” or “Any old umbrellas
to sell?” The traffickers in umbrellas are
also the crockmen, who are always glad to obtain
them in barter, and who merely dispose of
them at the Old Clothes Exchange, or in Petticoat-lane.</p>

<p>The umbrella-menders are known by an appellation
of an appropriateness not uncommon in
street language. They are <i>mushroom-fakers</i>.
The form of the expanded umbrella resembles
that of a mushroom, and it has the further characteristic
of being rapidly or suddenly raised, the
mushroom itself springing up and attaining its full
size in a very brief space of time. The term,
however, like all street or popular terms or phrases,
has become very generally condensed among those
who carry on the trade&mdash;they are now <i>mush-fakers</i>,
a word which, to any one who has not
heard the term in full, is as meaningless as any
in the vocabulary of slang.</p>

<p>The mushroom-fakers will repair any umbrella
on the owner’s premises, and their work is often
done adroitly, I am informed, and as often
bunglingly, or, in the trade term, “botched.” So
far there is no traffic in the business, the mushroom-faker
simply performing a piece of handicraft, and
being paid for the job. But there is another class
of street-folk who buy the old umbrellas in Petticoat-lane,
or of the street buyer or collector, and
“sometimes,” as one of these men said to me,
“we are our own buyers on a round.” They mend
the umbrellas&mdash;some of their wives, I am assured,
being adepts as well as themselves&mdash;and offer them
for sale on the approaches to the bridges, and at
the corners of streets.</p>

<p>The street umbrella trade is really curious. Not
so very many years back the use of an umbrella
by a man was regarded as partaking of effeminacy,
but now they are sold in thousands in the streets,
and in the second-hand shops of Monmouth-street
and such places. One of these street-traders told
me that he had lately sold, but not to an extent
which might encourage him to proceed, old silk
umbrellas in the street for gentlemen to protect
themselves from the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>The purchase of umbrellas is in a great degree
mixed up with that of old clothes, of which I have
soon to treat; but from what I have stated it is
evident that the umbrella trade is most connected
with street-artisanship, and under that head I
shall describe it.</p>


<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-JEWS"></a>OF THE STREET-JEWS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Although my present inquiry relates to London
life in London streets, it is necessary that I should
briefly treat of the Jews generally, as an integral,
but distinct and peculiar part of street-life.</p>

<p>That this ancient people were engaged in what
may be called street-traffic in the earlier ages of
our history, as well as in the importation of spices,
furs, fine leather, armour, drugs, and general
merchandise, there can be no doubt; nevertheless
concerning this part of the subject there are but
the most meagre accounts.</p>

<p>Jews were settled in England as early as 730,
and during the sway of the Saxon kings. They
increased in number after the era of the Conquest;
but it was not until the rapacity to which
they were exposed in the reign of Stephen had
in a great measure exhausted itself, and until
the measures of Henry II. had given encouragement
to commerce, and some degree of security
to property in cities or congregated communities,
that the Jews in England became numerous and
wealthy. They then became active and enterprising
attendants at fairs, where the greater
portion of the internal trade of the kingdom was
carried on, and especially the traffic in the more
valuable commodities, such as plate, jewels,
armour, cloths, wines, spices, horses, cattle, &amp;c.
The agents of the great prelates and barons, and
even of the ruling princes, purchased what they
required at these fairs. St. Giles’s fair, held at
St. Giles’s hill, not far from Winchester, continued
sixteen days. The fair was, as it were,
a temporary city. There were streets of tents
in every direction, in which the traders offered
and displayed their wares. During the continuance
of the fair, business was strictly prohibited
in Winchester, Southampton, and in every
place within seven miles of St. Giles’s hill.
Among the tent-owners at such fairs were the
Jews.</p>

<p>At this period the Jews may be considered as
one of the bodies of “merchant-strangers,” as
they were called, settled in England for purposes
of commerce. Among the other bodies of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
“strangers” were the German “merchants of the
steel-yard,” the Lombards, the Caursini of Rome,
the “merchants of the staple,” and others. These
were all corporations, and thriving corporations
(when unmolested), and the Jews had also their
Jewerie, or Judaisme, not for a “corporation”
merely, but also for the requirements of their
faith and worship, and for their living together.
The London Jewerie was established in a place
of which no vestige of its establishment now remains
beyond the name&mdash;the Old Jewry. Here
was erected the first synagogue of the Jews in
England, which was defaced or demolished,
Maitland states, by the citizens, after they had
slain 700 Jews (other accounts represent that
number as greatly exaggerated). This took place
in 1263, during one of the many disturbances in
the uneasy reign of Henry III.</p>

<p>All this time the Jews amassed wealth by trade
and usury, in spite of their being plundered and
maltreated by the princes and other potentates&mdash;every
one has heard of King John’s having a
Jew’s teeth drawn&mdash;and in spite of their being
reviled by the priests and hated by the people.
The sovereigns generally encouraged “merchant-strangers.”
When the city of London, in 1289,
petitioned Edward I. for “the expulsion of all
merchant-strangers,” that monarch answered,
with all a monarch’s peculiar regard for “great”
men and “great” men only, “No! the merchant-strangers
are useful and beneficial to the
great men of the kingdom, and I will not expel
them.” But though the King encouraged,
the people detested, <i>all</i> foreign traders, though
not with the same intensity as they detested
and contemned the Jews, for in <i>that</i> detestation
a strong religious feeling was an element.
Of this dislike to the merchant-strangers,
very many instances might be cited, but I need
give only one. In 1379, nearly a century after
the banishment of the Jews, a Genoese merchant,
a man of great wealth, petitioned Richard II. for
permission to deposit goods for safe keeping in
Southampton Castle, promising to introduce so
large a share of the commerce of the East into
England, that pepper should be 4<i>d.</i> a pound.
“Yet the Londoners,” writes Walsingham, but in
the quaint monkish Latin of the day, “enemies
to the prosperity of their country, hired assassins,
who murdered the merchant in the street.
After this, what stranger will trust his person
among a people so faithless and so cruel? who will
not dread our treachery, and abhor our name?”</p>

<p>In 1290, by a decree of Edward I., the Jews
were banished out of England. The causes assigned
for this summary act, were “their extortions,
their debasing and diminishing the coin,
and for other crimes.” I need not enter into the
merits or demerits of the Jews of that age, but it
is certain that any ridiculous charge, any which it
was impossible could be true, was an excuse for
the plundering of them at the hands of the
rich, and the persecution of them at the hands
of the people. At the period of this banishment,
their number is represented by the contemporaneous
historians to have been about
16,000, a number most probably exaggerated, as
perhaps all statements of the numbers of a people
are when no statistical knowledge has been acquired.
During this period of their abode in
England, the Jews were protected as the villeins
or bondsmen of the king, a protection disregarded
by the commonalty, and only giving to the
executive government greater facilities of extortion
and oppression.</p>

<p>In 1655 an Amsterdam Jew, Rabbi Manasseh
Ben-Israel, whose name is still highly esteemed
among his countrymen, addressed Cromwell on the
behalf of the Jews that they should be re-admitted
into England with the sanction, and under the
protection, of the law. Despite the absence of such
sanction, they had resided and of course traded in
this country, but in small numbers, and trading
often in indirect and sometimes in contraband
ways. Chaucer, writing in the days of Richard II.,
three reigns after their expulsion, speaks of Jews
as living in England. It is reputed that, in the
reigns of Elizabeth and the first James, they supplied,
at great profit, the materials required by the
alchymists for their experiments in the transmutation
of metals. In Elizabeth’s reign, too, Jewish
physicians were highly esteemed in England. The
Queen at one time confided the care of her health
to Rodrigo Lopez, a Hebrew, who, however, was
convicted of an attempt to poison his royal mistress.
Francis I., of France, carried his opinion of Jewish
medical skill to a great height; he refused on one
occasion, during an illness, to be attended by the
most eminent of the Israelitish physicians, because
the learned man had just before been converted to
Christianity. The most Christian king, therefore,
applied to his ally, the Turkish sultan, Solyman
II., who sent him “a true hardened Jew,” by
whose directions Francis drank asses’ milk and recovered.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s response to the application of Manasseh
Ben Israel was favourable; but the opposition
of the Puritans, and more especially of Prynne,
prevented any public declaration on the subject.
In 1656, however, the Jews began to arrive and
establish themselves in England, but not until after
the restoration of Charles II., in 1660, could it
be said that, as a body, they were settled in England.
They arrived from time to time, and without
any formal sanction being either granted or
refused. One reason alleged at the time was, that
the Jews were well known to be money-lenders,
and Charles and his courtiers were as well known
money-borrowers!</p>

<p>I now come to the character and establishment
of the Jews in the capacity in which I have more
especially to describe them&mdash;as street-traders.
There appears no reason to doubt that they commenced
their principal street traffic, the collecting
of old clothes, soon after their settlement in London.
At any rate the cry and calling of the Jew old
clothesman were so established, 30 or 40 years
after their return, or early in the last century, that
one of them is delineated in Tempest’s “Cries of
London,” published about that period. In this
work the street Jew is represented as very different
in his appearance to that which he presents in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
day. Instead of merely a dingy bag, hung empty
over his arm, or carried, when partially or wholly
filled, on his shoulder, he is depicted as wearing,
or rather carrying, three cocked hats, one over the
other, upon his head; a muff, with a scarf or large
handkerchief over it, is attached to his right hand
and arm, and two dress swords occupy his left
hand. The apparel which he himself wears is of
the full-skirted style of the day, and his long hair,
or periwig, descends to his shoulders. This difference
in appearance, however, between the street
Jew of 1700 and of a century and a half later, is
simply the effect of circumstances, and indicates
no change in the character of the man. Were it
now the fashion for gentlemen to wear muffs,
swords, and cocked hats, the Jew would again
have them in his possession.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the popular feeling
ran very high against the Jews, although to
the masses they were almost strangers, except as
men employed in the not-very-formidable occupation
of collecting and vending second-hand clothes.
The old feeling against them seems to have lingered
among the English people, and their own
greed in many instances engendered other and
lawful causes of dislike, by their resorting to unlawful
and debasing pursuits. They were considered&mdash;and
with that exaggeration of belief dear
to any ignorant community&mdash;as an entire people
of misers, usurers, extortioners, receivers of stolen
goods, cheats, brothel-keepers, sheriff’s-officers,
clippers and sweaters of the coin of the realm,
gaming-house keepers; in fine, the charges, or
rather the accusations, of carrying on every disreputable
trade, and none else, were “bundled at
their doors.” That there was too much foundation
for many of these accusations, and still <i>is</i>, no reasonable
Jew can now deny; that the wholesale
prejudice against them was absurd, is equally indisputable.</p>

<p>So strong was this popular feeling against the
Israelites, that it not only influenced, and not only
controlled the legislature, but it coerced the Houses
of Parliament to repeal, in 1754, an act which
they had passed the previous session, and that act
was merely to enable foreign Jews to be naturalized
without being required to take the sacrament!
It was at that time, and while the popular ferment
was at its height, unsafe for a Hebrew old clothesman,
however harmless a man, and however long
and well known on his beat, to ply his street-calling
openly; for he was often beaten and maltreated.
Mobs, riots, pillagings, and attacks upon
the houses of the Jews were frequent, and one of
the favourite cries of the mob was certainly among
the most preposterously stupid of any which ever
tickled the ear and satisfied the mind of the
<span class="lock">ignorant:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
“No Jews!<br />
No wooden shoes!!”<br />
</p>

<p>Some mob-leader, with a taste for rhyme, had in
this distich cleverly blended the prejudice against
the Jews with the easily excited but vague fears
of a French invasion, which was in some strange
way typified to the apprehensions of the vulgar as
connected with slavery, popery, the compulsory
wearing of wooden shoes (<i>sabots</i>), and the eating
of frogs! And this sort of feeling was often revenged
on the street-Jew, as a man mixed up
with wooden shoes! Cumberland, in the comedy
of “The Jew,” and some time afterwards Miss
Edgeworth, in the tale of “Harrington and Ormond,”
and both at the request of Jews, wrote
to moderate this rabid prejudice.</p>

<p>In what estimation the street, and, incidentally,
all classes of Jews are held at the present time,
will be seen in the course of my remarks; and in
the narratives to be given. I may here observe,
however, that among some the dominant feeling
against the Jews on account of their faith still
flourishes, as is shown by the following statement:&mdash;A
gentleman of my acquaintance was one
evening, about twilight, walking down Brydges-street,
Covent-garden, when an elderly Jew was
preceding him, apparently on his return from a
day’s work, as an old clothesman. His bag accidentally
touched the bonnet of a dashing woman
of the town, who was passing, and she turned
round, abused the Jew, and spat at him, saying
with an oath: “You old rags humbug! <i>You</i>
can’t do that!”&mdash;an allusion to a vulgar notion
that Jews have been unable to do more than
<i>slobber</i>, since spitting on the Saviour.</p>

<p>The number of Jews now in England is computed
at 35,000. This is the result at which the
Chief Rabbi arrived a few years ago, after collecting
all the statistical information at his command.
Of these 35,000, more than one-half, or about
18,000, reside in London. I am informed that
there may now be a small increase to this population,
but only small, for many Jews have emigrated&mdash;some
to California. A few years ago&mdash;a
circumstance mentioned in my account of the
Street-Sellers of Jewellery&mdash;there were a number
of Jews known as “hawkers,” or “travellers,”
who traverse every part of England selling
watches, gold and silver pencil-cases, eye-glasses,
and all the more portable descriptions of jewellery,
as well as thermometers, barometers, telescopes,
and microscopes. This trade is now little pursued,
except by the stationary dealers; and the Jews
who carried it on, and who were chiefly foreign
Jews, have emigrated to America. The foreign
Jews who, though a fluctuating body, are always
numerous in London, are included in the computation
of 18,000; of this population two-thirds
reside in the city, or the streets adjacent to the
eastern boundaries of the city.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Trades and Localities of the
Street-Jews.</span></h3>

<p>The trades which the Jews most affect, I was
told by one of themselves, are those in which, as
they describe it, “there’s a chance;” that is, they
prefer a trade in such commodity as is not subjected
to a fixed price, so that there may be
abundant scope for speculation, and something
like a gambler’s chance for profit or loss. In
this way, Sir Walter Scott has said, trade has
“all the fascination of gambling, without the
moral guilt;” but the absence of moral guilt in
connection with such trading is certainly dubious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The wholesale trades in foreign commodities
which are now principally or solely in the hands of
the Jews, often as importers and exporters, are,
watches and jewels, sponges&mdash;fruits, especially green
fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapes, walnuts,
cocoa-nuts, &amp;c., and dates among dried fruits&mdash;shells,
tortoises, parrots and foreign birds, curiosities,
ostrich feathers, snuffs, cigars, and pipes;
but cigars far more extensively at one time.</p>

<p>The localities in which these wholesale and retail
traders reside are mostly at the East-end&mdash;indeed
the Jews of London, as a congregated body,
have been, from the times when their numbers
were sufficient to institute a “settlement” or
“colony,” peculiar to themselves, always resident
in the eastern quarter of the metropolis.</p>

<p>Of course a wealthy Jew millionaire&mdash;merchant,
stock-jobber, or stock-broker&mdash;resides where
he pleases&mdash;in a villa near the Marquis of Hertford’s
in the Regent’s-park, a mansion near the
Duke of Wellington’s in Piccadilly, a house and
grounds at Clapham or Stamford-hill; but these
are exceptions. The quarters of the Jews are not difficult
to describe. The trading-class in the capacity
of shopkeepers, warehousemen, or manufacturers,
are the thickest in Houndsditch, Aldgate, and the
Minories, more especially as regards the “swag-shops”
and the manufacture and sale of wearing
apparel. The wholesale dealers in fruit are in
Duke’s-place and Pudding-lane (Thames-street),
but the superior retail Jew fruiterers&mdash;some of
whose shops are remarkable for the beauty of
their fruit&mdash;are in Cheapside, Oxford-street, Piccadilly,
and most of all in Covent-garden market.
The inferior jewellers (some of whom deal with
the first shops) are also at the East-end, about
Whitechapel, Bevis-marks, and Houndsditch; the
wealthier goldsmiths and watchmakers having,
like other tradesmen of the class, their shops in
the superior thoroughfares. The great congregation
of working watchmakers is in Clerkenwell,
but in that locality there are only a few
Jews. The Hebrew dealers in second-hand garments,
and second-hand wares generally, are
located about Petticoat-lane, the peculiarities of
which place I have lately described. The manufacturers
of such things as cigars, pencils, and sealing-wax;
the wholesale importers of sponge, bristles
and toys, the dealers in quills and in “looking-glasses,”
reside in large private-looking houses, when
display is not needed for purposes of business, in
such parts as Maunsell-street, Great Prescott-street,
Great Ailie-street, Leman-street, and other parts
of the eastern quarter known as Goodman’s-fields.
The wholesale dealers in foreign birds and shells,
and in the many foreign things known as “curiosities,”
reside in East Smithfield, Ratcliffe-highway,
High-street (Shadwell), or in some of the parts
adjacent to the Thames. In the long range of
river-side streets, stretching from the Tower to
Poplar and Blackwall, are Jews, who fulfil the
many capacities of slop-sellers, &amp;c., called into exercise
by the requirements of seafaring people on
their return from or commencement of a voyage.
A few Jews keep boarding-houses for sailors in
Shadwell and Wapping. Of the localities and
abodes of the poorest of the Jews I shall speak
hereafter.</p>

<p>Concerning the street-trades pursued by the
Jews, I believe there is not at present a single one
of which they can be said to have a monopoly;
nor in any one branch of the street-traffic are
there so many of the Jew traders as there were a
few years back.</p>

<p>This remarkable change is thus to be accounted
for. Strange as the fact may appear, the Jew has
been undersold in the streets, and he has been
beaten on what might be called his own ground&mdash;the
buying of old clothes. The Jew boys,
and the feebler and elder Jews, had, until some
twelve or fifteen years back, almost the monopoly
of orange and lemon street-selling, or street-hawking.
The costermonger class had possession of
the theatre doors and the approaches to the
theatres; they had, too, occasionally their barrows
full of oranges; but the Jews were the daily, assiduous,
and itinerant street-sellers of this most
popular of foreign, and perhaps of all, fruits. In
their hopes of sale they followed any one a mile
if encouraged, even by a few approving glances.
The great theatre of this traffic was in the stage-coach
yards in such inns as the Bull and Mouth,
(St. Martin’s-le-Grand), the Belle Sauvage (Ludgate-hill),
the Saracen’s Head (Snow-hill), the
Bull (Aldgate), the Swan-with-two-Necks (Lad-lane,
City), the George and Blue Boar (Holborn),
the White Horse (Fetter-lane), and other such
places. They were seen too, “with all their eyes
about them,” as one informant expressed it, outside
the inns where the coaches stopped to take
up passengers&mdash;at the White Horse Cellar in
Piccadilly, for instance, and the Angel and the
(now defunct) Peacock in Islington. A commercial
traveller told me that he could never leave
town by any “mail” or “stage,” without being
besieged by a small army of Jew boys, who most
pertinaciously offered him oranges, lemons, sponges,
combs, pocket-books, pencils, sealing-wax, paper,
many-bladed pen-knives, razors, pocket-mirrors,
and shaving-boxes&mdash;as if a man could not possibly
quit the metropolis without requiring a stock of
such commodities. In the whole of these trades,
unless in some degree in sponges and blacklead-pencils,
the Jew is now out-numbered or displaced.</p>

<p>I have before alluded to the underselling of
the Jew boy by the Irish boy in the street-orange
trade; but the characteristics of the change are so
peculiar, that a further notice is necessary. It is
curious to observe that the most assiduous, and
hitherto the most successful of street-traders, were
supplanted, not by a more persevering or more
skilful body of street-sellers, but simply by a more
<i>starving</i> body.</p>

<p>Some few years since poor Irish people, and
chiefly those connected with the culture of the
land, “came over” to this country in great
numbers, actuated either by vague hopes
of “bettering themselves” by emigration, or
working on the railways, or else influenced by
the restlessness common to an impoverished
people. These men, when unable to obtain em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>ployment,
without scruple became street-sellers.
Not only did the adults resort to street-traffic,
generally in its simplest forms, such as hawking
fruit, but the children, by whom they were accompanied
from Ireland, in great numbers, were
put into the trade; and if two or three children
earned 2<i>d.</i> a day each, and their parents 5<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i>
each, or even 4<i>d.</i>, the subsistence of the family was
better than they could obtain in the midst of the
miseries of the southern and western part of the
Sister Isle. An Irish boy of fourteen, having to
support himself by street-trade, as was often the
case, owing to the death of parents and to divers
casualties, would undersell the Jew boys similarly
circumstanced.</p>

<p>The Irish boy could live <i>harder</i> than the Jew&mdash;often
in his own country he subsisted on a stolen
turnip a day; he could lodge harder&mdash;lodge for 1<i>d.</i>
a night in any noisome den, or sleep in the open
air, which is seldom done by the Jew boy; he
could dispense with the use of shoes and stockings&mdash;a
dispensation at which his rival in trade
revolted; he drank only water, or if he took tea
or coffee, it was as a meal, and not merely as a
beverage; to crown the whole, the city-bred Jew
boy required some evening recreation, the penny
or twopenny concert, or a game at draughts or
dominoes; but this the Irish boy, country bred,
never thought of, for <i>his</i> sole luxury was a deep
sleep, and, being regardless or ignorant of all
such recreations, he worked longer hours, and so
sold more oranges, than his Hebrew competitor.
Thus, as the Munster or Connaught lad could live
on less than the young denizen of Petticoat-lane,
he could sell at smaller profit, and did so sell,
until gradually the Hebrew youths were displaced
by the Irish in the street orange trade.</p>

<p>It is the same, or the same in a degree, with
other street-trades, which were at one time all but
monopolised by the Jew adults. Among these
were the street-sale of spectacles and sponges.
The prevalence of slop-work and slop-wages, and
the frequent difficulty of obtaining properly-remunerated
employment&mdash;the pinch of want, in
short&mdash;have driven many mechanics to street-traffic;
so that the numbers of street-traffickers
have been augmented, while no small portion of
the new comers have adopted the more knowing
street avocations, formerly pursued only by the
Jews.</p>

<p>Of the other class of street-traders who have
interfered largely with the old-clothes trade,
which, at one time, people seemed to consider a
sort of birthright among the Jews, I have
already spoken, when treating of the dealings of
the crockmen in bartering glass and crockery-ware
for second-hand apparel. These traders now
obtain as many old clothes as the Jew clothes
men themselves; for, with a great number of
“ladies,” the offer of an ornament of glass or
spar, or of a beautiful and fragrant plant, is more
attractive than the offer of a small sum of money,
for the purchase of the left-off garments of the
family.</p>

<p>The crockmen are usually strong and in the
prime of youth or manhood, and are capable of
carrying heavy burdens of glass or china-wares,
for which the Jews are either incompetent or disinclined.</p>

<p>Some of the Jews which have been thus displaced
from the street-traffic have emigrated to
America, with the assistance of their brethren.</p>

<p>The principal street-trades of the Jews are now
in sponges, spectacles, combs, pencils, accordions,
cakes, sweetmeats, drugs, and fruits of all kinds;
but, in all these trades, unless perhaps in drugs,
they are in a minority compared with the “Christian”
street-sellers.</p>

<p>There is not among the Jew street-sellers generally
anything of the concubinage or cohabitation
common among the costermongers. Marriage is
the rule.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Jew Old-Clothes Men.</span></h3>

<p>Fifty years ago the appearance of the street-Jews,
engaged in the purchase of second-hand clothes,
was different to what it is at the present time.
The Jew then had far more of the distinctive
garb and aspect of a foreigner. He not unfrequently
wore the gabardine, which is never seen
now in the streets, but some of the long loose
frock coats worn by the Jew clothes’ buyers resemble
it. At that period, too, the Jew’s long
beard was far more distinctive than it is in this
hirsute generation.</p>

<p>In other respects the street-Jew is unchanged.
Now, as during the last century, he traverses
every street, square, and road, with the monotonous
cry, sometimes like a bleat, of “Clo’!
Clo’!” On this head, however, I have previously
remarked, when describing the street Jew of a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clo’, Clo’, Clo’.</span></p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>


<p>In an inquiry into the condition of the old-clothes
dealers a year and a half ago, a Jew gave
me the following account. He told me, at the
commencement of his statement, that he was of
opinion that his people were far more speculative
than the Gentiles, and therefore the English liked
better to deal with them. “Our people,” he said,
“will be out all day in the wet, and begrudge
themselves a bit of anything to eat till they go
home, and then, may be, they’ll gamble away their
crown, just for the love of speculation.” My informant,
who could write or speak several languages,
and had been 50 years in the business,
then said, “I am no bigot; indeed I do not care
where I buy my meat, so long as I can get it. I
often go into the Minories and buy some, without
looking to how it has been killed, or whether it
has a seal on it or not.”</p>

<p>He then gave me some account of the Jewish
children, and the number of men in the trade,
which I have embodied under the proper heads.
The itinerant Jew clothes man, he told me, was
generally the son of a former old-clothes man, but
some were cigar-makers, or pencil-makers, taking
to the clothes business when those trades were
slack; but that nineteen out of twenty had been
born to it. If the parents of the Jew boy are
poor, and the boy a sharp lad, he generally commences
business at ten years of age, by selling
lemons, or some trifle in the streets, and so, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
expressed it, the boy “gets a round,” or street-connection,
by becoming known to the neighbourhoods
he visits. If he sees a servant, he will,
when selling his lemons, ask if she have any old
shoes or old clothes, and offer to be a purchaser.
If the clothes should come to more than the Jew
boy has in his pocket, he leaves what silver he
has as “an earnest upon them,” and then seeks
some regular Jew clothes man, who will advance
the purchase money. This the old Jew agrees to
do upon the understanding that he is to have
“half Rybeck,” that is, a moiety of the profit, and
then he will accompany the boy to the house, to
pass his judgment on the goods, and satisfy himself
that the stripling has not made a blind bargain,
an error into which he very rarely falls.
After this he goes with the lad to Petticoat-lane,
and there they share whatever money the clothes
may bring over and above what has been paid for
them. By such means the Jew boy gets his knowledge
of the old-clothes business; and so quick are
these lads generally, that in the course of two
months they will acquire sufficient experience in
connection with the trade to begin dealing on
their own account. There are some, he told me,
as sharp at 15 as men of 50.</p>

<p>“It is very seldom,” my informant stated,
“very seldom indeed, that a Jew clothes man
takes away any of the property of the house he
may be called into. I expect there’s a good
many of ’em,” he continued, for he sometimes
spoke of his co-traders, as if they were not of his
own class, “is fond of cheating&mdash;that is, they
won’t mind giving only 2<i>s.</i> for a thing that’s
worth 5<i>s.</i> They are fond of money, and will do
almost anything to get it. Jews are perhaps the
most money-loving people in all England. There
are certainly some old-clothes men who will buy
articles at such a price that they must know them
to have been stolen. Their rule, however, is to
ask no questions, and to get as cheap an article as
possible. A Jew clothes man is seldom or never
seen in liquor. They gamble for money, either at
their own homes or at public-houses. The
favourite games are tossing, dominoes, and cards.
I was informed, by one of the people, that he had
seen as much as 30<i>l.</i> in silver and gold lying upon
the ground when two parties had been playing at
throwing three halfpence in the air. On a Saturday,
some gamble away the morning and the
greater part of the afternoon.” [Saturday, I need
hardly say, is the Hebrew Sabbath.] “They meet
in some secret back place, about ten, and begin
playing for ‘one a time’&mdash;that is, tossing up
three halfpence, and staking 1<i>s.</i> on the result.
Other Jews, and a few Christians, will gather
round and bet. Sometimes the bets laid by the
Jew bystanders are as high as 2<i>l.</i> each; and on
more than one occasion the old-clothes men have
wagered as much as 50<i>l.</i>, but only after great
gains at gambling. Some, if they <i>can</i>, will cheat,
by means of a halfpenny with a head or a tail on
both sides, called a ‘gray.’ The play lasts till
the Sabbath is nearly over, and then they go to
business or the theatre. They seldom or never
say a word while they are losing, but merely
stamp on the ground; it is dangerous, though, to
interfere when luck runs against them. The rule
is, when a man is losing to let him alone. I have
known them play for three hours together, and
nothing be said all that time but ‘head’ or ‘tail.’
They seldom go to synagogue, and on a Sunday
evening have card parties at their own houses.
They seldom eat anything on their rounds. The
reason is, not because they object to eat meat
killed by a Christian, but because they are afraid
of losing a ‘deal,’ or the chance of buying a lot of
old clothes by delay. They are generally too
lazy to light their own fires before they start of a
morning, and nineteen out of twenty obtain their
breakfasts at the coffee-shops about Houndsditch.</p>

<p>“When they return from their day’s work they
have mostly some stew ready, prepared by their
parents or wife. If they are not family men they
go to an eating-house. This is sometimes a
Jewish house, but if no one is looking they creep
into a Christian ‘cook-shop,’ not being particular
about eating ‘tryfer’&mdash;that is, meat which has
been killed by a Christian. Those that are single
generally go to a neighbour and agree with him
to be boarded on the Sabbath; and for this the
charge is generally about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> On a Saturday
there’s cold fish for breakfast and supper; indeed,
a Jew would pawn the shirt off his back sooner
than go without fish then; and in holiday-time
he <i>will</i> have it, if he has to get it out of the
stones. It is not reckoned a holiday unless there’s
fish.”</p>

<p>“Forty years ago I have made as much as 5<i>l.</i>
in a week by the purchase of old clothes in the
streets,” said a Jew informant. “Upon an average
then, I could earn weekly about 2<i>l.</i> But now
things are different. People are more wide awake.
Every one knows the value of an old coat now-a-days.
The women know more than the men. The
general average, I think, take the good weeks
with the bad throughout the year, is about 1<i>l.</i> a
week; some weeks we get 2<i>l.</i>, and some scarcely
nothing.”</p>

<p>I was told by a Jewish professional gentleman
that the account of the <i>spirit</i> of gambling prevalent
among his people was correct, but the amounts
said to be staked, he thought, rare or exaggerated.</p>

<p>The Jew old-clothes men are generally far more
cleanly in their habits than the poorer classes of
English people. Their hands they always wash
before their meals, and this is done whether the
party be a strict Jew or “Meshumet,” a convert,
or apostate from Judaism. Neither will the
Israelite ever use the same knife to cut his meat
that he previously used to spread his butter, and
he will not even put his meat on a plate that has
had butter on it; nor will he use for his soup the
spoon that has had melted butter in it. This objection
to mix butter with meat is carried so far,
that, after partaking of the one, Jews will not
eat of the other for the space of two hours. The
Jews are generally, when married, most exemplary
family men. There are few fonder fathers than
they are, and they will starve themselves sooner
than their wives and children should want.
Whatever their faults may be, they are good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fathers, husbands, and sons. Their principal
characteristic is their extreme love of money; and,
though the strict Jew does not trade himself on
the Sabbath, he may not object to employ either
one of his tribe, or a Gentile, to do so for him.</p>

<p>The capital required for commencing in the
old-clothes line is generally about 1<i>l.</i> This the
Jew frequently borrows, especially after holiday-time,
for then he has generally spent all his earnings,
unless he be a provident man. When his
stock-money is exhausted, he goes either to a
neighbour or to a publican in the vicinity, and
borrows 1<i>l.</i> on the Monday morning, “to strike a
light with,” as he calls it, and agrees to return it
on the Friday evening, with 1<i>s.</i> interest for the
loan. This he always pays back. If he was to
sell the coat off his back he would do this, I am
told, because to fail in so doing would be to prevent
his obtaining any stock-money for the future.
With this capital he starts on his rounds about
eight in the morning, and I am assured he will
frequently begin his work without tasting food,
rather than break into the borrowed stock-money.
Each man has his particular walk, and never interferes
with that of his neighbour; indeed, while
upon another’s beat he will seldom cry for clothes.
Sometimes they go half “Rybeck” together&mdash;that
is, they will share the profits of the day’s business,
and when they agree to do this the one will
take one street, and the other another. The lower
the neighbourhood the more old clothes are there
for sale. At the east end of the town they like
the neighbourhoods frequented by sailors, and
there they purchase of the girls and the women
the sailors’ jackets and trowsers. But they buy
most of the Petticoat-lane, the Old-Clothes Exchange,
and the marine-store dealers; for as the Jew
clothes man never travels the streets by night-time,
the parties who then have old clothes to dispose
of usually sell them to the marine-store or second-hand
dealers over-night, and the Jew buys them
in the morning. The first thing that he does on
his rounds is to seek out these shops, and see
what he can pick up there. A very great amount
of business is done by the Jew clothes man at the
marine-store shops at the west as well as at the
east end of London.</p>

<p>At the West-end the itinerant clothes men prefer
the mews at the back of gentlemen’s houses
to all other places, or else the streets where the
little tradesmen and small genteel families reside.
My informant assured me that he had once bought
a Bishop’s hat of his lordship’s servant for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>These traders, as I have elsewhere stated, live
at the East-end of the town. The greater number
of them reside in Portsoken Ward, Houndsditch;
and their favourite localities in this district are
either Cobb’s-yard, Roper’s-building, or Wentworth-street.
They mostly occupy small houses,
about 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week rent, and live with their
families. They are generally sober men. It is
seldom that a Jew leaves his house and owes his
landlord money; and if his goods should be seized
the rest of his tribe will go round and collect what
is owing.</p>

<p>The rooms occupied by the old-clothes men are
far from being so comfortable as those of the English
artizans whose earnings are not superior to
the gains of these clothes men. Those which I
saw had all a littered look; the furniture was old
and scant, and the apartment seemed neither
shop, parlour, nor bed-room. For domestic and
family men, as some of the Jew old-clothes men
are, they seem very indifferent to the comforts of
a home.</p>

<p>I have spoken of “Tryfer,” or meat killed in
the Christian fashion. Now, the meat killed according
to the Jewish law is known as “Coshar,”
and a strict Jew will eat none other. In one of
my letters in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> on the meat
markets of London, there appeared the following
statement, respecting the Jew butchers in Whitechapel-market.</p>

<p>“To a portion of the meat here exposed for
sale, may be seen attached the peculiar seal which
shows that the animal was killed conformably to
the Jewish rites. According to the injunctions of
this religion the beast must die from its throat
being cut, instead of being knocked on the head.
The slaughterer of the cattle for Jewish consumption,
moreover, must be a Jew. Two
slaughterers are appointed by the Jewish authorities
of the synagogue, and they can employ
others, who must be likewise Jews, as assistants.
The slaughterers I saw were quiet-looking and
quiet-mannered men. When the animal is
slaughtered and skinned, an examiner (also appointed
by the synagogue) carefully inspects the
‘inside.’ ‘If the lights be grown to the ribs,’
said my informant, who had had many years’ experience
in this branch of the meat trade, ‘or if
the lungs have any disease, or if there be any
disease anywhere, the meat is pronounced unfit
for the food of the Jews, and is sent entire to a
carcase butcher to be sold to the Christians. This,
however, does not happen once in 20 times.’ To
the parts exposed for sale, when the slaughtering
has been according to the Jewish law, there is
attached a leaden seal, stamped in Hebrew characters
with the name of the examining party
sealing. In this way, as I ascertained from the
slaughterers, are killed weekly from 120 to 140
bullocks, from 400 to 500 sheep and lambs, and
about 30 calves. All the parts of the animal thus
slaughtered may be and are eaten by the Jews,
but three-fourths of the purchase of this meat is
confined, as regards the Jews, to the fore-quarters
of the respective animals; the hind-quarters, being
the choicer parts, are sent to Newgate or Leadenhall-markets
for sale on commission.” The Hebrew
butchers consider that the Christian mode of
slaughter is a far less painful death to the ox
than was the Jewish.</p>

<p>I am informed that of the Jew Old-Clothes Men
there are now only from 500 to 600 in London;
at one time there might have been 1000. Their
average earnings may be something short of 20<i>s.</i> a
week in second-hand clothes alone; but the
gains are difficult to estimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of a Jew Street-Seller.</span></h3>

<p>An elderly man, who, at the time I saw him, was
vending spectacles, or bartering them for old
clothes, old books, or any second-hand articles,
gave me an account of his street-life, but it presented
little remarkable beyond the not unusual
vicissitudes of the lives of those of his class.</p>

<p>He had been in every street-trade, and had on
four occasions travelled all over England, selling
quills, sealing-wax, pencils, sponges, braces, cheap
or superior jewellery, thermometers, and pictures.
He had sold barometers in the mountainous parts
of Cumberland, sometimes walking for hours
without seeing man or woman. “<i>I liked it then</i>,”
he said, “<i>for I was young and strong, and
didn’t care to sleep twice in the same town</i>. I was
afterwards in the old-clothes line. I buy a few
odd hats and light things still, but I’m not able
to carry heavy weights, as my breath is getting
rather short.” [I find that the Jews generally
object to the more laborious kinds of street-traffic.]
“Yes, I’ve been twice to Ireland, and sold a
good many quills in Dublin, for I crossed over
from Liverpool. Quills and wax were a great
trade with us once; now it’s quite different.
I’ve had as much as 60<i>l.</i> of my own, and that
more than half-a-dozen times, but all of it went
in speculations. Yes, some went in gambling. I
had a share in a gaming-booth at the races, for
three years. O, I dare say that’s more than 20
years back; but we did very little good. There
was such fees to pay for the tent on a race-ground,
and often such delays between the races
in the different towns, and bribes to be given to
the town-officers&mdash;such as town-sergeants and chief
constables, and I hardly know who&mdash;and so many
expenses altogether, that the profits were mostly
swamped. Once at Newcastle races there was a
fight among the pitmen, and our tent was in their
way, and was demolished almost to bits. A deal
of the money was lost or stolen. I don’t know how
much, but not near so much as my partners wanted
to make out. I wasn’t on the spot just at the
time. I got married after that, and took a shop
in the second-hand clothes line in Bristol, but my
wife died in child-bed in less than a year, and the
shop didn’t answer; so I got sick of it, and at
last got rid of it. O, I work both the country
and London still. I shall take a turn into Kent
in a day or two. I suppose I clear between 10<i>s.</i>
and 20<i>s.</i> a week in anything, and as I’ve only
myself, I do middling, and am ready for another
chance if any likely speculation offers. I lodge
with a relation, and sometimes live with his
family. No, I never touch any meat but ‘Coshar.’
I suppose my meat now costs me 6<i>d.</i> or 7<i>d.</i> a day,
but it has cost me ten times that&mdash;and 2<i>d.</i> for beer
in addition.”</p>

<p>I am informed that there are about 50 adult
Jews (besides old-clothes men) in the streets
selling fruit, cakes, pencils, spectacles, sponge,
accordions, drugs, &amp;c.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Jew-Boy Street-Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>I have ascertained, and from sources where no
ignorance on the subject could prevail, that there
are now in the streets of London, rather more than
100 Jew-boys engaged principally in fruit and
cake-selling in the streets. Very few Jewesses
are itinerant street-sellers. Most of the older Jews
thus engaged have been street-sellers from their
boyhood. The young Jews who ply in street-callings,
however, are all men in matters of traffic,
almost before they cease, in years, to be children.
In addition to the Jew-boy street-sellers above
enumerated, there are from 50 to 100, but usually
about 50, who are occasional, or “casual” street-traders,
vending for the most part cocoa-nuts and
grapes, and confining their sales chiefly to the
Sundays.</p>

<p>On the subject of the street-Jew boys, a Hebrew
gentleman said to me: “When we speak of street-Jew
boys, it should be understood, that the great
majority of them are but little more conversant
with or interested in the religion of their fathers,
than are the costermonger boys of whom you have
written. They are Jews by the accident of their
birth, as others in the same way, with equal ignorance
of the assumed faith, are Christians.”</p>

<p>I received from a Jew boy the following account
of his trading pursuits and individual aspirations.
There was somewhat of a thickness in his
utterance, otherwise his speech was but little distinguishable
from that of an English street-boy.
His physiognomy was decidedly Jewish, but not
of the handsomer type. His hair was light-coloured,
but clean, and apparently well brushed,
without being oiled, or, as I heard a street-boy
style it, “greased”; it was long, and he said his
aunt told him it “wanted cutting sadly;” but he
“liked it that way;” indeed, he kept dashing
his curls from his eyes, and back from his temples,
as he was conversing, as if he were somewhat
vain of doing so. He was dressed in a
corduroy suit, old but not ragged, and wore a
tolerably clean, very coarse, and altogether buttonless
shirt, which he said “was made for one bigger
than me, sir.” He had bought it for 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> in Petticoat-lane,
and accounted it a bargain, as its wear
would be durable. He was selling sponges when
I saw him, and of the commonest kind, offering a
large piece for 3<i>d.</i>, which (he admitted) would be
rubbed to bits in no time. This sponge, I should
mention, is frequently “dressed” with sulphuric
acid, and an eminent surgeon informed me that
on his servant attempting to clean his black dress
coat with a sponge that he had newly bought in
the streets, the colour of the garment, to his horror,
changed to a bright purple. The Jew boy <span class="lock">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I believe I’m twelve. I’ve been to school,
but it’s long since, and my mother was very ill
then, and I was forced to go out in the streets to
have a chance. I never was kept to school. I
can’t read; I’ve forgot all about it. I’d rather
now that I could read, but very likely I could
soon learn if I could only spare time, but if I
stay long in the house I feel sick; it’s not
healthy. O, no, sir, inside or out it would be all
the same to me, just to make a living and keep my
health. I can’t say how long it is since I began
to sell, it’s a good long time; one must do some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>thing.
I could keep myself now, and do sometimes,
but my father&mdash;I live with him (my
mother’s dead) is often laid up. Would you like
to see him, sir? He knows a deal. No, he
can’t write, but he can read a little. Can I speak
Hebrew? Well, I know what you mean. O,
no, I can’t. I don’t go to synagogue; I haven’t
time. My father goes, but only sometimes; so
he says, and he tells me to look out, for we must
both go by-and-by.” [I began to ask him what
he knew of Joseph, and others recorded in the Old
Testament, but he bristled up, and asked if I
wanted to make a Meshumet (a convert) of him?]
“I have sold all sorts of things,” he continued,
“oranges, and lemons, and sponges, and nuts, and
sweets. I should like to have a real good ginger-beer
fountain of my own; but I must wait, and
there’s many in the trade. I only go with boys
of my own sort. I sell to all sorts of boys,
but that’s nothing. Very likely they’re Christians,
but that’s nothing to me. I don’t know what’s
the difference between a Jew and Christian, and
I don’t want to talk about it. The Meshumets
are never any good. Anybody will tell you that.
Yes, I like music and can sing a bit. I get to a
penny and sometimes a two-penny concert. No,
I haven’t been to Sussex Hall&mdash;I know where it
is&mdash;I shouldn’t understand it. You get in for
nothing, that’s one thing. I’ve heard of Baron
Rothschild. He has more money than I could
count in shillings in a year. I don’t know about
his wanting to get into parliament, or what it
means; but he’s sure to do it or anything else,
with his money. He’s very charitable, I’ve
heard. I don’t know whether he’s a German
Jew, or a Portegee, or what. He’s a cut above
me, a precious sight. I only wish he was my
uncle. I can’t say what I should do if I had his
money. Perhaps I should go a travelling, and see
everything everywhere. I don’t know how long
the Jews have been in England; always perhaps.
Yes, I know there’s Jews in other countries.
This sponge is Greek sponge, but I don’t know
where it’s grown, only it’s in foreign parts. Jerusalem!
Yes, I’ve heard of it. I’m of no tribe
that I know of. I buy what I eat about Petticoat-lane.
No, I don’t like fish, but the stews, and
the onions with them is beautiful for two-pence;
you may get a pennor’th. The pickles&mdash;cowcumbers
is best&mdash;are stunning. But they’re plummiest
with a bit of cheese or anything cold&mdash;that’s
my opinion, but you may think different. Pork!
Ah! No, I never touched it; I’d as soon eat a
cat; so would my father. No, sir, I don’t think
pork smells nice in a cook-shop, but some Jew
boys, as I knows, thinks it does. I don’t know
why it shouldn’t be eaten, only that it’s wrong to
eat it. No, I never touched a ham-sandwich, but
other Jew boys have, and laughed at it, I know.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I make in a week. I
think I make as much on one thing as on another.
I’ve sold strawberries, and cherries, and gooseberries,
and nuts and walnuts in the season. O,
as to what I make, that’s nothing to nobody.
Sometimes 6<i>d.</i> a day, sometimes 1<i>s.</i>; sometimes a
little more, and sometimes nothing. No, I never
sells inferior things if I can help it, but if one
hasn’t stock-money one must do as one can, but it
isn’t so easy to try it on. There was a boy
beaten by a woman not long since for selling a
big pottle of strawberries that was rubbish all
under the toppers. It was all strawberry leaves,
and crushed strawberries, and such like. She
wanted to take back from him the two-pence she’d
paid for it, and got hold of his pockets and there
was a regular fight, but she didn’t get a farthing
back though she tried her very hardest, ’cause he
slipped from her and hooked it. So you see it’s
dangerous to try it on.” [This last remark was
made gravely enough, but the lad told of the feat
with such manifest glee, that I’m inclined to
believe that he himself was the culprit in question.]
“Yes, it was a Jew boy it happened to, but other
boys in the streets is just the same. Do I like
the streets? I can’t say I do, there’s too little
to be made in them. <i>No, I wouldn’t like to go
to school, nor to be in a shop, nor be anybody’s
servant but my own.</i> O, I don’t know what I
shall be when I’m grown up. I shall take my
chance like others.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Pursuits, Dwellings, Traffic, etc.,
of the Jew-Boy Street-Sellers.</span></h3>

<p>To speak of the street Jew-boys as regards their
traffic, manners, haunts, and associations, is to
speak of the same class of boys who may not be
employed regularly in street-sale, but are the
comrades of those who are; a class, who, on any
cessation of their employment in cigar manufactories,
or indeed any capacity, will apply themselves
temporarily to street-selling, for it seems to
these poor and uneducated lads a sort of natural
vocation.</p>

<p>These youths, <i>uncontrolled</i> or <i>incontrollable</i> by
their parents (who are of the lowest class of the
Jews, and who often, I am told, care little about the
matter, so long as the child can earn his own maintenance),
frequently in the evenings, after their day’s
work, resort to coffee-shops, in preference even to
a cheap concert-room. In these places they amuse
themselves as men might do in a tavern where the
landlord leaves his guests to their own caprices.
Sometimes one of them reads aloud from some
exciting or degrading book, the lads who are
unable to read listening with all the intentness
with which many of the uneducated attend to any
one reading. The reading is, however, not unfrequently
interrupted by rude comments from the
listeners. If a newspaper be read, the “police,”
or “crimes,” are mostly the parts preferred. But
the most approved way of passing the evening,
among the Jew boys, is to play at draughts, dominoes,
or cribbage, and to bet on the play.
Draughts and dominoes are unpractised among
the costermonger boys, but some of the young
Jews are adepts in those games.</p>

<p>A gentleman who took an interest in the Jew
lads told me that he had often heard the sort of
reading and comments I have described, when he
had called to talk to and perhaps expostulate with,
these youths in a coffee-shop, but he informed me
that they seldom regarded any expostulation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
seemed to be little restrained by the presence of
a stranger, the lads all muttering and laughing in
a box among themselves. I saw seven of them,
a little after eight in the evening, in a coffee-shop
in the London-road,&mdash;although it is not much of
a Jewish locality,&mdash;and two of them were playing
at draughts for coffee, while the others looked on,
betting halfpennies or pennies with all the eagerness
of gamblers, unrestrained in their expressions
of delight or disappointment as they thought they
were winning or losing, and commenting on the
moves with all the assurance of connoisseurship;
sometimes they squabbled angrily and then suddenly
dropped their voices, as the master of the
coffee-shop had once or twice cautioned them to
be quiet.</p>

<p>The dwellings of boys such us these are among
the worst in London, as regards ventilation, comfort,
or cleanliness. They reside in the courts
and recesses about Whitechapel and Petticoat-lane,
and generally in a garret. If not orphans
they usually dwell with their father. I am told that
the care of a mother is almost indispensable to a
poor Jew boy, and having that care he seldom
becomes an outcast. The Jewesses and Jew girls
are rarely itinerant street-sellers&mdash;not in the proportion
of one to twelve, compared with the men
and boys; in this respect therefore the street Jews
differ widely from the English costermongers and
the street Irish, nor are the Hebrew females even
stall-keepers in the same proportion.</p>

<p>One Jew boy’s lodging which I visited was in
a back garret, low and small. The boy lived with
his father (a street-seller of fruit), and the room
was very bare. A few sacks were thrown over
an old palliass, a blanket seemed to be used for
a quilt; there were no fire-irons nor fender; no
cooking utensils. Beside the bed was an old
chest, serving for a chair, while a board resting
on a trestle did duty for a table (this was once,
I presume, a small street-stall). The one not very
large window was thick with dirt and patched all
over. Altogether I have seldom seen a more
wretched apartment. The man, I was told, was
addicted to drinking.</p>

<p>The callings of which the Jew boys have the
monopoly are not connected with the sale of any
especial article, but rather with such things as present
a variety from those ordinarily offered in the
streets, such as cakes, sweetmeats, fried fish, and
(in the winter) elder wine. The cakes known as
“boolers”&mdash;a mixture of egg, flour, and candied
orange or lemon peel, cut very thin, and with a
slight colouring from saffron or something similar&mdash;are
now sold principally, and used to be sold exclusively,
by the Jew boys. Almond cakes (little
round cakes of crushed almonds) are at present
vended by the Jew boys, and their sponge biscuits
are in demand. All these dainties are bought
by the street-lads of the Jew pastry-cooks. The
difference in these cakes, in their sweetmeats, and
their elder wine, is that there is a dash of spice
about them not ordinarily met with. It is the
same with the fried fish, a little spice or pepper
being blended with the oil. In the street-sale of
pickles the Jews have also the monopoly; these,
however, are seldom hawked, but generally sold
from windows and door-steads. The pickles are
cucumbers or gherkins, and onions&mdash;a large cucumber
being 2<i>d.</i>, and the smaller 1<i>d.</i> and &frac12;<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The faults of the Jew lad are an eagerness to
make money by any means, so that he often grows
up a cheat, a trickster, a receiver of stolen goods,
though seldom a thief, for he leaves that to others.
He is content to profit by the thief’s work, but
seldom <i>steals</i> himself, however he may cheat.
Some of these lads become rich men; others are
vagabonds all their lives. None of the Jew lads
confine themselves to the sale of any one article,
nor do they seem to prefer one branch of street-traffic
to another. Even those who cannot read
are exceedingly quick.</p>

<p>I may here observe in connection with the receipt
of stolen goods, that I shall deal with this
subject in my account of the <span class="smcap">London Thieves</span>.
I shall also show the connection of Jewesses and
Jews with the <i>prostitution of the metropolis</i>, in
my forthcoming exposition of the <span class="smcap">London Prostitutes</span>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street Jewesses and Street
Jew-Girls.</span></h3>

<p>I have mentioned that the Jewesses and the
young Jew girls, compared with the adult Jews and
Jew boys, are not street-traders in anything like
the proportion which the females were found to bear
to the males among the Irish street-folk and the
English costermongers. There are, however, a few
Jewish females who are itinerant street-sellers as
well as stall keepers, in the proportion, perhaps,
of one female to seven or eight males. The
majority of the street Jew-girls whom I saw on a
round were accompanied by boys who were represented
to be their brothers, and I have little
doubt such was the facts, for these young Jewesses,
although often pert and ignorant, are not unchaste.
Of this I was assured by a medical gentleman
who could speak with sufficient positiveness on the
subject.</p>

<p>Fruit is generally sold by these boys and girls
together, the lad driving the barrow, and the girl
inviting custom and handing the purchases to the
buyers. In tending a little stall or a basket at a
regular pitch, with such things as cherries or strawberries,
the little Jewess differs only from her
street-selling sisters in being a brisker trader. The
stalls, with a few old knives or scissors, or odds
and ends of laces, that are tended by the Jew
girls in the streets in the Jewish quarters (I am
told there are not above a dozen of them) are
generally near the shops and within sight of their
parents or friends. One little Jewess, with whom
I had some conversation, had not even heard the
name of the Chief Rabbi, the Rev. Dr. Adler, and
knew nothing of any distinction between German
and Portuguese Jews; she had, I am inclined to
believe, never heard of either. I am told that
the whole, or nearly the whole, of these young
female traders reside with parents or friends, and
that there is among them far less than the average
number of runaways. One Jew told me he thought
that the young female members of his tribe did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
not tramp with the juveniles of the other sex&mdash;no,
not in the proportion of one to a hundred in
comparison, he said with a laugh, with “young
women of the Christian persuasion.” My informant
had means of knowing this fact, as although
still a young man, he had traversed the greater
part of England hawking perfumery, which he
had abandoned as a bad trade. A wire-worker,
long familiar with tramping and going into the
country&mdash;a man upon whose word I have every
reason to rely&mdash;told me that he could not remember
a single instance of his having seen a young
Jewess “travelling” with a boy.</p>

<p>There are a few adult Jewesses who are itinerant
traders, but very few. I met with one who carried
on her arm a not very large basket, filled with
glass wares; chiefly salt-cellars, cigar-ash plates,
blue glass dessert plates, vinegar-cruets, and such
like. The greater part of her wares appeared to
be blue, and she carried nothing but glass. She
was a good-looking and neatly-dressed woman.
She peeped in at each shop-door, and up at the
windows of every private house, in the street in
which I met her, crying, “Clo’, old clo’!” She
bartered her glass for old clothes, or bought the
garments, dealing principally in female attire, and
almost entirely with women. She declined to say
anything about her family or her circumstances,
except that she had nothing that way to complain
about, but&mdash;when I had used some names I had
authority to make mention of&mdash;she said she would,
with pleasure, tell me all about her trade, which
she carried on rather than do nothing. “When
I hawk,” she said with an English accent, her face
being unmistakeably Jewish, “I hawk only good
glass, and it can hardly be called hawking, as I
swop it for more than I sell it. I always ask for
the mistress, and if she wants any of my glass we
come to a bargain if we can. O, it’s ridiculous to
see what things some ladies&mdash;I suppose they must
be called ladies&mdash;offer for my glass. Children’s
green or blue gauze veils, torn or faded, and not
worth picking up, because no use whatever; old
ribbons, not worth dyeing, and old frocks, not
worth washing. People say, ‘as keen as a Jew,’
but ladies can’t think we’re very keen when they
offer us such rubbish. I do most at the middle
kind of houses, both shops and private. I sometimes
give a little money for such a thing as a
shawl, or a fur tippet, as well as my glass&mdash;but
only when I can’t help it&mdash;to secure a bargain.
Sometimes, but not often, I get the old thing and
a trifle for my glass. Occasionally I buy outright.
I don’t do much, there’s so many in the
line, and I don’t go out regularly. I can’t say
how many women are in my way&mdash;very few; O,
I do middling. I told you I had no complaints
to make. I don’t calculate my profits or what I
sell. My family do that and I don’t trouble myself.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Synagogues and the Religion of
the Street and other Jews.</span></h3>

<p>The Jews in this country are classed as “Portuguese”
and “German.” Among them are no
distinctions of tribes, but there is of rites and
ceremonies, as is set forth in the following extract
(which shows also the mode of government) from
a Jewish writer: “The Spanish and Portuguese
Congregation of Jews, who are also called Sephardin
(from the word Sepharad, which signifies
Spain in Hebrew), are distinct from the German
and Polish Jews in their ritual service. The
prayers both daily and for the Sabbath materially
differ from each other, and the festival prayers
differ still more. Hence the Portuguese Jews
have a distinct prayer-book, and the German Jews
likewise.</p>

<p>“The fundamental laws are equally observed by
both sects, but in the ceremonial worship there
exists numerous differences. The Portuguese Jews
eat some food during the Passover, which the
German Jews are prohibited doing by <i>some</i> Rabbis,
but their authority is not acknowledged by
the Portuguese Rabbis. Nor are the present
ecclesiastical authorities in London of the two
sects the same. The Portuguese Jews have their
own Rabbis, and the German have their own.
The German Jews are much more numerous
than the Portuguese; the chief Rabbi of the
German Jews is the Rev. Dr. Nathan Marcus
Adler, late Chief Rabbi of Hanover, who wears
no beard, and dresses in the German costume.
The presiding Rabbi of the Portuguese Jews is
the Rev. David Meldola, a native of Leghorn;
his father filled the same office in London. Each
chief Rabbi is supported by three other Rabbis,
called Dayamin, which signifies in Hebrew
‘Judges.’ Every Monday and Thursday the
Chief Rabbi of the German Jews, Dr. Adler,
supported by his three colleagues, sits for two hours
in the Rabbinical College (Beth Hamedrash),
Smith’s-buildings, Leadenhall-street, to attend to
all applications from the German Jews, which
may be brought before him, and which are
decided according to the Jewish law. Many disputes
between Jews in religious matters are settled
in this manner; and if the Lord Mayor or any
other magistrate is told that the matter has already
been settled by the Jewish Rabbi he seldom interferes.
This applies only to civil and not to
criminal cases. The Portuguese Jews have their
own hospital and their own schools. Both congregations
have their representatives in the Board
of Deputies of British Jews, which board is acknowledged
by government, and is triennial. Sir
Moses Montefiore, a Jew of great wealth, who
distinguished himself by his mission to Damascus,
during the persecution of the Jews in that place,
and also by his mission to Russia, some years ago,
is the President of the Board. All political
matters, calling for communications with government,
are within the province of that useful
board.”</p>

<p>The Jews have eight synagogues in London,
besides some smaller places which may perhaps,
adopting the language of another church, be called
synagogues of ease. The great synagogue in
Duke’s-place (a locality of which I have often had
to speak) is the largest, but the new synagogue,
St. Helen’s, Bishopgate, is the one which most
betokens the wealth of the worshippers. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
rich with ornaments, marble, and painted glass;
the pavement is of painted marble, and presents a
perfect round, while the ceiling is a half dome.
There are besides these the Hamburg Synagogue,
in Fenchurch-street; the Portuguese Synagogue,
in Bevis-marks; two smaller places, in Cutler-street
and Gun-yard, Houndsditch, known as
Polish Synagogues; the Maiden-lane (Covent-garden),
Synagogue; the Western Synagogue, St.
Alban’s-place, Pall-mall; and the West London
Synagogue of British Jews, Margaret-street,
Cavendish-square. The last-mentioned
is the most aristocratic of the synagogues.
The service there is curtailed, the ritual abbreviated,
and the days of observance of the
Jewish festival reduced from two to one. This
alteration is strongly protested against by the
other Jews, and the practices of this synagogue
seem to show a yielding to the exactions or requirements
of the wealthy. In the old days, and
in almost every country in Europe, it was held to
be sinful even for a king&mdash;reverenced and privileged
as such a potentate then was&mdash;to prosecute any
undertaking before he heard mass. In some
states it was said in reproach of a noble or a sovereign,
“he breakfasts before he hears mass,” and,
to meet the impatience of the Great, “hunting
masses,” as they were styled, or epitomes of the
full service, were introduced. The Jews, some
eight or nine years back in this country, seem to
have followed this example; such was the case, at
least, as regards London and the wealthier of the
professors of this ancient faith.</p>

<p>The synagogues are not well attended, the congregations
being smaller in proportion to the population
than those of the Church of England.
Neither, during the observance of the Jewish
worship, is there any especial manifestation of the
service being regarded as of a sacred and divinely-ordained
character. There is a buzzing talk
among the attendants during the ceremony, and
an absence of seriousness and attention. Some of
the Jews, however, show the greatest devotion,
and the same may be said of the Jewesses, who
sit apart in the synagogues, and are not required
to attend so regularly as the men.</p>

<p>I should not have alluded to this absence of the
solemnities of devotion, as regards the congregations
of the Hebrews, had I not heard it regretted
by Hebrews themselves. “It is shocking,” one
said. Another remarked, “To attend the synagogue
is looked upon too much as a matter of
<i>business</i>; but perhaps there is the same spirit in
some of the Christian churches.”</p>

<p>As to the street-Jews, religion is little known
among them, or little cared for. They are indifferent
to it&mdash;not to such a degree, indeed, as the
costermongers, for they are not so ignorant a
class&mdash;but yet contrasting strongly in their neglect
with the religious intensity of the majority of the
Roman Catholic Irish of the streets. In common
justice I must give the remark of a Hebrew merchant
with whom I had some conversation on the
subject:&mdash;“I can’t say much about street-Jews, for
my engagements lead me away from them, and I
don’t know much about street-Christians. But if
out of a hundred Jews you find that only ten of
them care for their religion, how many out of a
hundred Christians of any sort will care about
theirs? Will ten of them care? If you answer,
but they are only nominal Christians, my reply is,
the Jews are only nominal Jews&mdash;Jews by birth,
and not by faith.”</p>

<p>Among the Jews I conversed with&mdash;and of
course only the more intelligent understood, or
were at all interested in, the question&mdash;I heard
the most contemptuous denunciation of all converts
from Judaism. One learned informant, who was
by no means blind to the short-comings of his own
people, expressed his conviction that no Jew had
ever been really <i>converted</i>. He had abandoned
his faith from interested motives. On this subject
I am not called upon to express any opinion, and
merely mention it to show a prevalent feeling
among the class I am describing.</p>

<p>The street-Jews, including the majority of the
more prosperous and most numerous class among
them, the old-clothes men, are far from being
religious in feeling, or well versed in their faith,
and are, perhaps, in that respect on a level with
the mass of the members of the Church of England;
I say of the Church of England, because
of that church the many who do not profess religion
are usually accounted members.</p>

<p>In the Rabbinical College, I may add, is the
finest Jewish library in the world. It has been
collected for several generations under the care of
the Chief Rabbis. The public are admitted,
having first obtained tickets, given gratuitously, at
the Chief Rabbi’s residence in Crosby-square.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Politics, Literature, and Amusements
of the Jews.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps there is no people in the world, possessing
the average amount of intelligence in busy
communities, who care so little for politics as the
general body of the Jews. The wealthy classes
may take an interest in the matter, but I am
assured, and by those who know their countrymen
well, that even with them such a quality as
patriotism is a mere word. This may be accounted
for in a great measure, perhaps, from an
hereditary feeling. The Jew could hardly be expected
to love a land, or to strive for the promotion
of its general welfare, where he felt he was but a
sojourner, and where he was at the best but
tolerated and often proscribed. But this feeling
becomes highly reprehensible when it extends&mdash;as
I am assured it does among many of the rich
Jews&mdash;to their own people, for whom, apart from
conventionalities, say my informants, <i>they care
nothing whatever</i>; for so long as they are undisturbed
in money-getting at home, their brethren
may be persecuted all over the world, while the
rich Jew merely shrugs his shoulders. An honourable
exception, however, exists in Sir Moses Montefiore,
who has honourably distinguished himself in
the relief of his persecuted brethren on more than
one occasion. The great of the earth no longer spit
upon the gabardine of the Jewish millionaire, nor
do they draw his teeth to get his money, but the
great Jew capitalists, with powerful influence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
many a government, do not seek to direct that influence
for the bettering of the lot of their poorer
brethren, who, at the same time, brook the restrictions
and indignities which they have to suffer
with a perfect philosophy. In fact, the Jews have
often been the props of the courts who have persecuted
them; that is to say, two or three Jewish
firms occasionally have not hesitated to lend millions
to the governments by whom they and their
people have been systematically degraded and
oppressed.</p>

<p>I was told by a Hebrew gentleman (a professional
man) that so little did the Jews themselves
care for “Jewish emancipation,” that he
questioned if one man in ten, actuated solely by
his own feelings, would trouble himself to walk
the length of the street in which he lived to
secure Baron Rothschild’s admission into the House
of Commons. This apathy, my informant urged
with perfect truth, in nowise affected the merits
of the question, though he was convinced it formed
a great obstacle to Baron Rothschild’s success;
“for governments,” he said, “won’t give boons
to people who don’t care for them; and, though
this is called a boon, I look upon it as only a
<i>right</i>.”</p>

<p>When such is the feeling of the comparatively
wealthier Jews, no one can wonder that I found
among the Jewish street-sellers and old-clothes
men with whom I talked on the subject&mdash;and
their more influential brethren gave me every
facility to prosecute my inquiry among them&mdash;a
perfect indifference to, and nearly as perfect an
ignorance of, politics. Perhaps no men buy so
few newspapers, and read them so little, as the
Jews generally. The street-traders, when I
alluded to the subject, said they read little but
the “Police Reports.”</p>

<p>Among the body of the Jews there is little love
of Literature. They read far less (let it be remembered
I have acquired all this information from
Jews themselves, and from men who could not be
mistaken in the matter), and are far less familiar
with English authorship, either historical or
literary, than are the poorer English artizans.
Neither do the wealthiest classes of the Jews
care to foster literature among their own people.
One author, a short time ago, failing to interest
the English Jews, to promote the publication
of his work, went to the United States, and
his book was issued in Philadelphia, the city of
Quakers!</p>

<p>The Amusements of the Jews&mdash;and here I
speak more especially of the street or open-air
traders&mdash;are the theatres and concert-rooms. The
City of London Theatre, the Standard Theatre,
and other playhouses at the East-end of London,
are greatly resorted to by the Jews, and more
especially by the younger members of the body,
who sometimes constitute a rather obstreperous
gallery. The cheap concerts which they patronize
are generally of a superior order, for the Jews
are fond of music, and among them have been
many eminent composers and performers, so that
the trash and jingle which delights the costermonger
class would not please the street Jew boys;
hence their concerts are superior to the general
run of cheap concerts, and are almost always
“got up” by their own people.</p>

<p>Sussex-hall, in Leadenhall-street, is chiefly supported
by Israelites; there the “Jews’ and
General Literary and Scientific Institution” is
established, with reading-rooms and a library;
and there lectures, concerts, &amp;c., are given as
at similar institutions. Of late, on every Friday
evening, Sussex-hall has been thrown open to
the general public, without any charge for admission,
and lectures have been delivered gratuitously,
on literature, science, art, and
general subjects, which have attracted crowded
audiences. The lecturers are chiefly Jews, but
the lectures are neither theological nor sectarian.
The lecturers are Mr. M. H. Bresslau, the Rev.
B. H. Ascher, Mr. J. L. Levison (of Brighton),
and Mr. Clarke, a merchant in the City, a Christian,
whose lectures are very popular among the
Jews. The behaviour of the Jew attendants, and
the others, the Jews being the majority, is decorous.
They seem “to like to receive information,”
I was told; and a gentleman connected
with the hall argued that this attention showed a
readiness for proper instruction, when given in an
attractive form, which favoured the opinion that
the young Jews, when not thrown in childhood into
the vortex of money-making, were very easily
teachable, while their natural quickness made
them both ready and willing to be taught.</p>

<p>My old-clothes buying informant mentioned
a Jewish eating-house. I visited one in the
Jew quarter, but saw nothing to distinguish it
from Christian resorts of the same character and
cheapness (the “plate” of good hot meat costing
4<i>d.</i>, and vegetables 1<i>d.</i>), except that it was fuller
of Jews than of Christians, by three to two, perhaps,
and that there was no “pork” in the waiter’s
specification of the fare.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Charities, Schools, and Education
of the Jews.</span></h3>

<p>The Jewish charities are highly honourable to
the body, for they allow none of their people to live
or die in a parish workhouse. It is true that among
the Jews in London there are many individuals
of immense wealth; but there are also many rich
Christians who care not one jot for the need of
their brethren. It must be borne in mind also,
that not only do the Jews voluntarily support
their own poor and institutions, but they contribute&mdash;compulsorily
it is true&mdash;their quota to
the support of the English poor and church; and,
indeed, pay their due proportion of all the parliamentary
or local imposts. This is the more
honourable and the more remarkable among the
Jews, when we recollect their indisputable greed
of money.</p>

<p>If a Jew be worn out in his old age, and
unable to maintain himself, he is either supported
by the contributions of his friends, or out of some
local or general fund, or provided for in some
asylum, and all this seems to be done with a
less than ordinary fuss and display, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
recipient of the charity feels himself more a
pensioner than a pauper.</p>

<p>The Jews’ Hospital, in the Mile-end Road, is an
extensive building, into which feeble old men and
destitute children of both sexes are admitted.
Here the boys are taught trades, and the girls
qualified for respectable domestic service. The
Widows’ Home, in Duke-street, Aldgate, is for
poor Hebrew widows. The Orphan Asylum,
built at the cost of Mr. A. L. Moses, and supported
by subscription, now contains 14 girls
and 8 boys; a school is attached to the asylum,
which is in the Tenter Ground, Goodman’s-fields.
The Hand-in-Hand Asylum, for decayed old
people, men and women, is in Duke’s-place, Aldgate.
There are likewise alms-houses for the
Jews, erected also by Mr. A. L. Moses, at Mile-end,
and other alms-houses, erected by Mr. Joel
Emanuel, in Wellclose-square, near the Tower.
There are, further, three institutions for granting
marriage dowers to fatherless children; an institution
in Bevis-marks, for the burial of the poor
of the congregation; “Beth Holim;” a house
for the reception of the sick poor, and of poor
lying-in women belonging to the congregation of
the Spanish and Portuguese Jews; “Magasim
Zobim,” for lending money to aid apprenticeships
among boys, to fit girls for good domestic service,
and for helping poor children to proceed to
foreign parts, when it is believed that the change
will be advantageous to them; and “Noten Lebem
Larcebim;” to distribute bread to the poor
of the congregation on the day preceding the Sabbath.</p>

<p>I am assured that these institutions are well-managed,
and that, if the charities are abused
by being dispensed to undeserving objects, it is
usually with the knowledge of the managers,
who often let the abuse pass, as a smaller evil
than driving a man to theft or subjecting him to
the chance of starvation. One gentleman, familiar
with most of these establishments, said to
me with a laugh, “I believe, if you have had
any conversation with the gentlemen who manage
these matters, you will have concluded that they
are not the people to be imposed upon very
easily.”</p>

<p>There are seven Jewish schools in London, four
in the city, and three at the West-end, all supported
by voluntary contributions. The Jews’
Free School, in Bell-lane, Spitalfields, is the
largest, and is adapted for the education of no
fewer than 1200 boys and girls. The late Baroness
de Rothschild provided clothing, yearly, for
all the pupils in the school. In the Infant School,
Houndsditch, are about 400 little scholars. There
are also the Orphan Asylum School, previously
mentioned; the Western Jewish schools, for girls,
in Dean-street, and, for boys, in Greek-street,
Soho, but considered as one establishment; and
the West Metropolitan School, for girls, in Little
Queen-street, and, for boys, in High Holborn,
also considered as one establishment.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these means of education, the
body of the poorer, or what in other callings might
be termed the working-classes, are not even tolerably
well educated; they are indifferent to the
matter. With many, the multiplication table
seems to constitute what they think the acme of
all knowledge needful to a man. The great
majority of the Jew boys, in the street, cannot
read. A smaller portion can read, but so imperfectly
that their ability to read detracts nothing
from their ignorance. So neglectful or so necessitous
(but I heard the ignorance attributed to
neglect far more frequently than necessity) are the
poorer Jews, and so soon do they take their
children away from school, “to learn and do something
for themselves,” and so irregular is their
attendance, on the plea that the time cannot be
spared, and the boy must do something for himself,
that many children leave the free-schools not
only about as ignorant as when they entered
them, but almost with an incentive to continued
ignorance; for they knew nothing of reading,
except that to acquire its rudiments is a pain, a
labour, and a restraint. On some of the Jew
boys the vagrant spirit is strong; they <i>will</i> be
itinerants, if not wanderers,&mdash;though this is a
spirit in no way confined to the Jew boys.</p>

<p>Although the wealthier Jews may be induced
to give money towards the support of their poor,
I heard strong strictures passed upon them concerning
their indifference towards their brethren
in all other respects. Even if they subscribed to
a school, they never cared whether or not it was
attended, and that, much as was done, far more
was in the power of so wealthy and distinct a
people. “This is all the more inexcusable,” was
said to me by a Jew, “because there are so many
rich Jews in London, and if they exerted and exercised
a broader liberality, as they might in instituting
Jewish colleges, for instance, to promote
knowledge among the middle-classes, and if they
cared more about employing their own people,
their liberality would be far more fully felt than
similar conduct in a Christian, because they have
a smaller sphere to influence. As to employing
their own people, there are numbers of the rich
Jews who will employ any stranger in preference,
if he work a penny a week cheaper. This sort of
<i>clan</i> employment,” continued my Jew informant,
“should never be exclusive, but there might, I
think, be a judicious preference.”</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to set forth an account of
the sums yearly subscribed for purposes of education
and charity by the Jews.</p>

<p>The Jews’ Free School in Spitalfields is supported
by voluntary contributions to the amount of
about 1200<i>l.</i> yearly. To this sum a few Christians
contribute, as to some other Hebrew institutions
(which I shall specify), while Jews often are
liberal supporters of Christian public charities&mdash;indeed,
some of the wealthier Jews are looked
upon by the members of their own faith as inclined
to act more generously where Christian charities,
with the prestige of high aristocratic and fashionable
patronage, are in question, than towards their
own institutions. To the Jews’ Free School the
Court of Common Council of the Corporation of
London lately granted 100<i>l.</i>, through the exertions
of Mr. Benjamin S. Phillips, of Newgate-street, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
member of the court. The Baroness Lionel de
Rothschild (as I have formerly stated of the late
Baroness) supplies clothing for the scholars. The
school is adapted for the reception of 1200 boys
and girls in equal proportion; about 900 is the
average attendance.</p>

<p>The Jews’ Infant School in Houndsditch, with
an average attendance approaching 400, is similarly
supported at a cost of from 800<i>l.</i> to 1000<i>l.</i>
yearly.</p>

<p>The Orphan Asylum School, in Goodman’s-fields,
receives a somewhat larger support, but in
the expenditure is the cost of an asylum (before
mentioned, and containing 22 inmates). The
funds are about 1500<i>l.</i> yearly. Christians subscribe
to this institution also&mdash;Mr. Frederick Peel,
M.P., taking great interest in it. The attendance
of pupils is from 300 to 400.</p>

<p>It might be tedious to enumerate the other
schools, after having described the principal; I will
merely add, therefore, that the yearly contributions
to each are from 700<i>l.</i> to 1000<i>l.</i>, and the pupils
taught in each from 200 to 400. Of these further
schools there are four already specified.</p>

<p>The Jews’ Hospital, at Mile End, is maintained
at a yearly cost of about 3000<i>l.</i>, to which
Christians contribute, but not to a twentieth of
the amount collected. The persons benefited are
worn-out old men, and destitute children, while
the number of almspeople is from 150 to 200
yearly.</p>

<p>The other two asylums, &amp;c., which I have
specified, are maintained at a cost of about 800<i>l.</i>
each, as a yearly average, and the Almshouses,
three in number, at about half that sum. The
persons relieved by these last-mentioned institutions
number about 250, two-thirds, or thereabouts,
being in the asylums.</p>

<p>The Loan Societies are three: the Jewish
Ladies Visiting and Benevolent Loan Society;
the Linusarian Loan Society (why called Linusarian
a learned Hebrew scholar could not inform
me, although he had asked the question of others);
and the Magasim Zobim (the Good Deeds), a Portuguese
Jews’ Loan Society.</p>

<p>The business of these three societies is conducted
on the same principle. Money is lent on
personal or any security approved by the managers,
and no interest is charged to the borrower. The
amount lent yearly is from 600<i>l.</i> to 700<i>l.</i> by each
society, the whole being repaid and with sufficient
punctuality; a few weeks’ “grace” is occasionally
allowed in the event of illness or any unforeseen
event. The Loan Societies have not yet found it
necessary to proceed against any of their debtors;
my informant thought this forbearance extended
over six years.</p>

<p>There is not among the Jewish street-traders,
as among the costermongers and others, a class
forming part, or having once formed part of themselves,
and living by usury and loan mongering,
where they have amassed a few pounds. Whatever
may be thought of the Jews’ usurious dealings
as regards the general public, the poorer classes of
their people are not subjected to the exactions of
usury, with all its clogs to a struggling man’s
well-doing. Sometimes the amount required by
an old-clothes man, or other street-trader, is
obtained by or for him at one of these loan
societies. Sometimes it is advanced by the usual
buyer of the second-hand garments collected by the
street-Jew. No security in such cases is given beyond&mdash;strange
as it may sound&mdash;the personal honour
of an old-clothes man! An experienced man told
me, that taking all the class of Jew street-sellers,
who are a very fluctuating body, with the exception
of the old-clothes men, the sum thus advanced
as stock-money to them might be seldom
less in any one year than 300<i>l.</i>, and seldom more
than 500<i>l.</i> There is a prevalent notion that
the poorer Jews, when seeking charity, are supplied
with goods for street-sale by their wealthy
brethren, and never with money&mdash;this appears to
be unfounded.</p>

<p>Now to sum up the above items we find that the
yearly cost of the Jewish schools is about 7000<i>l.</i>,
supplying the means of instruction to 3000 children
(out of a population of 18,000 of all ages,
one-half of whom, perhaps, are under 20 years).
The yearly outlay in the asylums, &amp;c., is, it appears,
5800<i>l.</i> annually, benefiting or maintaining
about 420 individuals (at a cost of nearly 14<i>l.</i>
per head). If we add no more than 200<i>l.</i> yearly
for the minor charities or institutions I have previously
alluded to, we find 14,000<i>l.</i> expended
annually in the public schools and charities of the
Jews of London, independently of about 2000<i>l.</i>,
which is the amount of the loans to those requiring
temporary aid.</p>

<p>We have before seen that the number of
Jews in London is estimated by the best informed
at about 18,000; hence it would appear that the
charitable donations of the Jews of London
amount on an average to a little less than 1<i>l.</i> per
head. Let us compare this with the benevolence
of the Christians. At the same ratio the sum devoted
to the charities of England and Wales
should be very nearly 16,000,000<i>l.</i>, but, according
to the most liberal estimates, it does not
reach half that amount; the rent of the land and
other fixed property, together with the interest
of the money left for charitable purposes in England
and Wales, is 1,200,000<i>l.</i> If, however, we
add to the voluntary contributions the sum raised
compulsorily by assessment in aid of the poor
(about 7,000,000<i>l.</i> per annum), the ratio of the
English Christian’s contributions to his needy
brethren throughout the country will be very
nearly the same as that of the Jew’s. Moreover,
if we turn our attention to the benevolent bequests
and donations of the Christians of London, we
shall find that their munificence does not fall far
short of that of the metropolitan Jews. The
gross amounts of the charitable contributions of
London are given below, together with the numbers
of institutions; and it will thus be seen that
the sum devoted to such purposes amounts to no
less than 1,764,733<i>l.</i>, or upwards of a million and
three-quarters sterling for a population of about
two millions!</p>

<p>In connection with the statistical part of this
subject I may mention that the Chief Rabbis each
receive 1200<i>l.</i> a year; the Readers of the Synagogues,
of whom there are twelve in London, from
300<i>l.</i> to 400<i>l.</i> a year each; the Secretaries of the
Synagogues, of whom there are also twelve, from
200<i>l.</i> to 300<i>l.</i> each; the twelve under Secretaries
from 100<i>l.</i> to 150<i>l.</i>; and six Dayanim 100<i>l.</i> a year
each. These last-mentioned officers are looked
upon by many of the Jews, as the “poor curates”
may be by the members of the Church of England&mdash;as
being exceedingly under-paid. The
functions of the Dayanim have been already mentioned,
and, I may add, that they must have received
expensive scholarly educations, as for about
four hours daily they have to read the Talmud
in the places of worship.</p>

<p>The yearly payment of these sacerdotal officials,
then, independent of other outlay, amounts to
about 11,700<i>l.</i>; this is raised from the profits of
the seats in the synagogues and voluntary contributions,
donations, subscriptions, bequests,
&amp;c., among the Jews.</p>

<p>I have before spoken of a Board of Deputies,
in connection with the Jews, and now proceed to
describe its constitution. It is not a parliament
among the Jews, I am told nor a governing
power, but what may be called a directing or
regulating body. It is authorized by the body of
Jews, and recognised by her Majesty’s Government,
as an established corporation, with powers
to treat and determine on matters of civil and
political policy affecting the condition of the
Hebrews in this country, and interferes in no way
with religious matters. It is neither a metropolitan
nor a local nor a detached board, but, as
far as the Jews in England may be so described,
a national board. This board is elected triennially.
The electors are the “seat-holders” in the Jewish
synagogues; that is to say, they belong to the class
of Jews who promote the support of the synagogues
by renting seats, and so paying towards
the cost of those establishments.</p>

<p>There are in England, Ireland, and Scotland,
about 1000 of these seat-holders exercising the
franchise, or rather entitled to exercise it, but many
of them are indifferent to the privilege, as is often
testified by the apathy shown on the days of
election. Perhaps three-fourths of the privileged
number may vote. The services of the representatives
are gratuitous, and no qualification
is required, but the elected are usually the
leading metropolitan Jews. The proportion of
the electors voting is in the ratio of the deputies
elected. London returns 12 deputies; Liverpool,
2; Manchester, 2; Birmingham, 2; Edinburgh,
Dublin, (the only places in either Scotland
or Ireland returning deputies), Dover, Portsmouth,
Southampton, Plymouth, Canterbury, Norwich,
Swansea, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and two other places
(according to the number of seat-holders), each
one deputy, thus making up the number to 30.
On election days the attendance, as I have said,
is often small, but fluctuating according to any
cause of excitement, which, however, is but seldom.</p>

<p>The question which has of late been discussed
by this Board, and which is now under consideration,
and negotiation with the Education Commissioners
of her Majesty’s Privy Council, is the
obtaining a grant of money in the same proportion
as it has been granted to other educational
establishments. Nothing has as yet been given
to the Jewish schools, and the matter is still undetermined.</p>

<p>With religious or sacerdotal questions the Board
of Deputies does not, or is not required to meddle; it
leaves all such matters to the bodies or tribunals I
have mentioned. Indeed the deputies concern themselves
only with what may be called the <i>public</i>
interests of the Jews, both as a part of the community
and as a distinct people. The Jewish
institutions, however, are not an exception to the
absence of unanimity among the professors of the
same creeds, for the members of the Reform Synagogue
in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, are
not recognised as entitled to vote, and do not
vote, accordingly, in the election of the Jewish
deputies. Indeed, the Reform members, whose
synagogue was established eight years ago, were
formally excommunicated by a declaration of the
late Chief Rabbi, but this seems now to be regarded
as a mere matter of form, for the members
have lately partaken of all the rites to
which orthodox Jews are entitled.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Funeral Ceremonies, Fasts, and
Customs of the Jews.</span></h3>

<p>The funeral ceremonies of the Jews are among
the things which tend to preserve the distinctness
and peculiarity of this people. Sometimes, though
now rarely, the nearest relatives of the deceased
wear sackcloth (a coarse crape), and throw ashes
and dust on their hair, for the term during which
the corpse remains unburied, this term being the
same as among Christians. When the corpse is
carried to the Jews’ burial-ground for interment
the coffin is frequently opened, and the corpse
addressed, in a Hebrew formula, by any relative,
friend, or acquaintance who may be present.
The words are to the following purport: “If I
have done anything that might be offensive&mdash;pardon,
pardon, pardon.” After that the coffin is
carried round the burial-ground in a circuit, children
chanting the 90th Psalm in its original
Hebrew, “a prayer of Moses, the man of God.”
The passages which the air causes to be most
emphatic are these <span class="lock">verses:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“3. Thou turnest man to destruction; and
sayest, Return, ye children of men.</p>

<p>“4. For a thousand years in thy sight are but
as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in
the night.</p>

<p>“5. Thou carriest them away as with a flood;
they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like
grass which groweth up.</p>

<p>“6. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth
up; in the evening it is cut down, and
withereth.</p>

<p>“10. The days of our years are threescore
years and ten; and if by reason of strength they
be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour
and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
away.”</p>

<p>The coffin is then carried into a tent, and the
funeral prayers, in Hebrew, are read. When it
has been lowered into the grave, the relatives,
and indeed all the attendants at the interment,
fill up the grave, shovelling in the earth. In the
Jews’ burial-ground are no distinctions, no vaults
or provisions for aristocratic sepulture. The very
rich and the very poor, the outcast woman and the
virtuous and prosperous gentlewoman, “grossly
familiar, side by side consume.” A Jewish funeral
is a matter of high solemnity.</p>

<p>The burial fees are 12<i>s.</i> for children, and from
2<i>l.</i> to 3<i>l.</i> for adults. These fees are not the property
of the parties officiating, but form a portion
of the synagogue funds for general purposes, payment
of officers, &amp;c. No fees are charged to the
relatives of poor Jews.</p>

<p>Two fasts are rigidly observed by the Jews,
and even by those Jews who are usually indifferent
to the observances of their religion. These
are the Black Fast, in commemoration of the
destruction of Jerusalem, and the White Fast, in
commemoration of the atonement. On each of
those occasions the Jews abstain altogether from
food for 24 hours, or from sunset to sunset.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Jew Street-Sellers of Accordions,
and of their Street Musical Pursuits.</span></h3>

<p>I conclude my account of the Street-Jews with
an account of the accordion sellers.</p>

<p>Although the Jews, as a people, are musical,
they are little concerned at present either in the
sale of musical instruments in the streets, or in
street-music or singing. Until within a few years,
however, the street-sale of accordions was carried
on by itinerant Jews, and had previously been
carried on most extensively in the country, even
in the far north of England. Some years back
well-dressed Jews “travelled” with stocks of
accordions. In many country towns and in gentlemen’s
country mansions, in taverns, and schools
also, these accordions were then a novelty. The
Jew could play on the instrument, and carried a
book of instructions, which usually formed part of
the bargain, and by the aid of which, he made out,
any one, even without previous knowledge of the
practical art of music, could easily teach himself&mdash;nothing
but a little practice in fingering being
wanted to make a good accordion-player. At first
the accordions sold by the Jew hawkers were
good, two guineas being no unusual price to be
paid for one, even to a street-seller, while ten and
twenty shillings were the lower charges. But the
accordions were in a few years “made slop,”
cheap instruments being sent to this country from
Germany, and sold at less than half their former
price, until the charge fell as low as 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or even
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;but only for “rubbish,” I was told.
When the fragility and inferior musical qualities
of these instruments came to be known, it was
found almost impossible to sell in the streets even
superior instruments, however reasonable in price,
and thus the trade sunk to a nonentity. So little
demand is there now for these instruments that no
pawnbroker, I am assured, will advance money on
one, however well made.</p>

<p>The itinerant accordion trade was always much
greater in the country than in London, for in
town, I was told, few would be troubled to try, or
even listen, to the tones of an accordion played by
a street-seller, at their own doors, or in their
houses. While there were 100 or 120 Jews
hawking accordions in the country, there would
not be 20 in London, including even the suburbs,
where the sale was the best.</p>

<p>Calculating that, when the trade was at its best,
130 Jews hawked accordions in town and
country, and that each sold three a week, at an
average price of 20<i>s.</i> each, or six in a week at an
average price of 10<i>s.</i> each, the profit being from
50 to 100 per cent., we find upwards of 20,000<i>l.</i>
expended in the course of the year in accordions
of which, however, little more than a sixth part, or
about 3000<i>l.</i>, was expended in London. This was
only when the trade had all the recommendations
of novelty, and in the following year perhaps not
half the amount was realized. One informant
thought that the year 1828-9 was the best for the
sale of these instruments, but he spoke only from
memory. At the present time I could not find or
hear of one street-Jew selling accordions; I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>member,
however, having seen one within the
present year. Most of the Jews who travelled
with them have emigrated.</p>

<p>It is very rarely indeed that, fond as the Jews
are of music, any of them are to be found in the
bands of street-musicians, or of such street-performers
as the Ethiopian serenaders. If there be
any, I was told, they were probably not pure
Jews, but of Christian parentage on one side or
the other, and not associating with their own
people. At the cheap concert-rooms, however,
Jews are frequently singers, but rarely the
Jewesses, while some of the twopenny concerts
at the East-end are got up and mainly patronized
by the poorer class of Jews. Jews are also
to be found occasionally among the supernumeraries
of the theatres; but, when not professionally
engaged, these still live among their own people.
I asked one young Jew who occasionally sang at
a cheap concert-room, what description of songs
they usually sung, and he answered “all kinds.”
He, it seems, sang comic songs, but his friend
Barney, who had just left him, sang sentimental
songs. He earned 1<i>s.</i> and sometimes 2<i>s.</i>, but
more frequently 1<i>s.</i>, three or four nights in the
week, as he had no regular engagement. In the
daytime he worked at cigar-making, but did not
like it, it was “<i>so confining</i>.” He had likewise
sung, but gratuitously, at concerts got up for the
benefit of any person “bad off.” He knew nothing
of the science and art of music. Of the superior
class of Jew vocalists and composers, it is not of
course necessary here to speak, as they do not
come within the scope of my present subject. Of
Hebrew youths thus employed in cheap and desultory
concert-singing, there are in the winter
season, I am told, from 100 to 150, few, if any,
depending entirely upon their professional exertions,
but being in circumstances similar to those
of my young informant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Buyers of Hogs’-Wash.</span></h3>

<p>The trade in hogs’-wash, or in the refuse of the
table, is by no means insignificant. The street-buyers
are of the costermonger class, and some of
them have been costermongers, and “when not
kept going regular on wash,” I was told, are
“costers still,” but with the advantage of having
donkeys, ponies, or horses and carts, and frequently
shops, as the majority of the wash-buyers
have; for they are often greengrocers as well as
costermongers.</p>

<p>The hogs’ food obtained by these street-folk,
or, as I most frequently heard it called, the
“wash,” is procured from the eating-houses, the
coffee-houses which are also eating-houses (with
“hot joints from 12 to 4”), the hotels, the club-houses,
the larger mansions, and the public institutions.
It is composed of the scum and lees of
all broths and soups; of the washings of cooking
utensils, and of the dishes and plates used at
dinners and suppers; of small pieces of meat left
on the plates of the diners in taverns, clubs, or
cook-shops; of pieces of potato, or any remains of
vegetables; of any viands, such as puddings, left
in the plates in the same manner; of gristle; of
pieces of stale bread, or bread left at table; occasionally
of meat kept, whether cooked or uncooked,
until “blown,” and unfit for consumption
(one man told me that he had found whole
legs of mutton in the wash he bought from a
great eating-house, but very rarely): of potato-peelings;
of old and bad potatoes; of “stock,” or
the remains of meat stewed for soup, which was
not good enough for sale to be re-used by the
poor; of parings of every kind of cheese or
meat; and of the many things which are considered
“only fit for pigs.”</p>

<p>It is not always, however, that the unconsumed
food of great houses or of public bodies (where the
dinners are a part of the institution) goes to the
wash-tub. At Buckingham-palace, I am told, it
is given to poor people who have tickets for the
receipt of it. At Lincoln’s-inn the refuse or
leavings of the bar dinners are sold to men who
retail them, usually small chandlers, and the poor
people, who have the means, buy this broken
meat very readily at 4<i>d.</i>, 6<i>d.</i>, and 8<i>d.</i> the pound,
which is cheap for good cooked meat. Pie-crust,
obtained by its purveyors in the same way, is
sold, perhaps with a small portion of the contents
of the pie, in penny and twopenny-worths. A
man familiar with this trade told me that among
the best customers for this kind of second-hand
food were women of the town of the poorer class,
who were always ready, whenever they had a
few pence at command, to buy what was tasty,
cheap, and ready-cooked, because “they hadn’t
no trouble with it, but only just to eat it.”</p>

<p>One of the principal sources of the “wash”
supply is the cook-shops, or eating-houses, where
the “leavings” on the plates are either the perquisites
of the waiters or waitresses, or looked
sharply after by master or mistress. There are
also in these places the remains of soups, and the
potato-peelings, &amp;c., of which I have spoken,
together with the keen appropriation to a profitable
use of every crumb and scrap&mdash;when it is a
portion of the gains of a servant, or when it adds
to the receipts of the proprietor. In calculating
the purchase-value of the good-will of an eating-house,
the “wash” is as carefully considered as is
the number of daily guests.</p>

<p>One of the principal street-buyers from the
eating-houses, and in several parts of town, is
Jemmy Divine, of Lambeth. He is a pig-dealer,
but also sells his wash to others who keep pigs.
He sends round a cart and horse under the care
of a boy, or of a man, whom he may have employed,
or drives it himself, and he often has more
carts than one. In his cart are two or three tubs,
well secured, so that they may not be jostled out,
into which the wash is deposited. He contracts
by the week, month, or quarter, with hotel-keepers
and others, for their wash, paying from 10<i>l.</i> to as
high as 50<i>l.</i> a year, about 20<i>l.</i> being an average
for well-frequented taverns and “dining-rooms.”
The wash-tubs on the premises of these buyers
are often offensive, sometimes sending forth very
sour smells.</p>

<p>In Sharp’s-alley, Smithfield, is another man
buying quantities of wash, and buying fat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
grease extensively. There is one also in Prince’s-street,
Lambeth, who makes it his sole business
to collect hogs’-wash; he was formerly a coal-heaver
and wretchedly poor, but is now able to
make a decent livelihood in this trade, keeping a
pony and cart. He generally keeps about 30
pigs, but also sells hogs’ food retail to any pig-keeper,
the price being 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> a pail-full, according
to the quality, as the collectors are always
anxious to have the wash “rich,” and will not
buy it if cabbage-leaves or the parings of green
vegetables form a part of it. This man and the
others often employ lads to go round for wash,
paying them 2<i>s.</i> a week, and finding them in board.
They are the same class of boys as those I have
described as coster-boys, and are often strong
young fellows. These lads&mdash;or men hired for the
purpose&mdash;are sometimes sent round to the smaller
cook-shops and to private houses, where the wash is
given to them for the trouble of carrying it away,
in preference to its being thrown down the drain.
Sometimes only 1<i>d.</i> a pail is paid by the street-buyer,
provided the stuff be taken away punctually
and regularly. These youths or men carry pails
after the fashion of a milkman.</p>

<p>The supply from the workhouses is very large.
It is often that the paupers do not eat all the
rice-pudding allowed, or all the bread, while soup
is frequently left, and potatoes; and these leavings
are worthless, except for pig-meat, as they would
soon turn sour. It is the same, though not to the
same extent, in the prisons.</p>

<p>What I have said of some of the larger eating-houses
relates also to the club-houses.</p>

<p>There are a number of wash-buyers in the
suburbs, who purchase, or obtain their stock gratuitously,
at gentlemen’s houses, and retail it
either to those who feed pigs as a business, or
else to the many, I was told, who live a little
way out of town, and “like to grow their own
bacon.” Many of these men perform the work
themselves, without a horse and cart, and are on
their feet every day and all day long, except on
Sundays, carrying hogs’-wash from the seller, or to
the buyer. One man, who had been in this trade
at Woolwich, told me that he kept pigs at one
time, but ceased to do so, as his customers often
murmured at the thin quality of the wash, declaring
that he gave all the best to his own animals.</p>

<p>If it be estimated that there are 200 men daily
buying hogs’-wash in London and the suburbs,
within 15 miles, and that each collects only 20
pails per day, paying 2<i>d.</i> per pail (thus allowing
for what is collected without purchase), we find
10,400<i>l.</i> expended annually in buying hogs’-wash.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Buyers of Tea-Leaves.</span></h3>

<p>An extensive trade, but less extensive, I am informed,
than it was a few years ago, is carried on
in tea-leaves, or in the leaves of the herb after
their having been subjected, in the usual way, to
decoction. These leaves are, so to speak, re-manufactured,
in spite of great risk and frequent
exposure, and in defiance of the law. The 17th
Geo. III., c. 29, is positive and stringent on the
<span class="lock">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Every person, whether a dealer in or seller
of tea, or not, who shall dye or fabricate any sloe-leaves,
liquorice-leaves <i>or the leaves of tea that
have been used</i>, or the leaves of the ash, elder or
other tree, shrub or plant, in imitation of tea, or
who shall mix or colour such leaves with terra
Japonica, copperas, sugar, molasses, clay, logwood
or other ingredient, or who shall sell or expose to
sale, or have in custody, any such adulterations
in imitation of tea, shall for every pound forfeit,
on conviction, by the oath of one witness, before
one justice, 5<i>l.</i>; or, on non-payment, be committed
to the House of Correction for not more than
twelve or less than six months.”</p>

<p>The same act also authorizes a magistrate, on the
oath of an excise officer, or any one, by whom he
suspects this illicit trade to be carried on, to seize
the herbs, or spurious teas, and the whole apparatus
that may be found on the premises, the
herbs to be burnt and the other articles sold, the
proceeds of such a sale, after the payment of expenses,
going half to the informer and half to the
poor of the parish.</p>

<p>It appears evident, from the words of this act
which I have <i>italicised</i>, that the use of tea-leaves
for the robbery of the public and the defrauding
of the revenue has been long in practice. The
extract also shows what other cheats were formerly
resorted to&mdash;the substitutes most popular with the
tea-manufacturers at one time being sloe-leaves. If,
however, one-tenth of the statements touching the
applications of the leaves of the sloe-tree, and of the
juice of its sour, astringent fruit, during the war-time,
had any foundation in truth, the sloe must
have been regarded commercially as one of the
most valuable of our native productions, supplying
our ladies with their tea, and our gentlemen with
their port-wine.</p>

<p>Women and men, three-fourths of the number
being women, go about buying tea-leaves of the
female servants in the larger, and of the shopkeepers’
wives in the smaller, houses. But the
great purveyors of these things are the charwomen.
In the houses where they char the tea-leaves
are often reserved for them to be thrown on
the carpets when swept, as a means of allaying the
dust, or else they form a part of their perquisites,
and are often asked for if not offered. The mistress
of a coffee-shop told me that her charwoman,
employed in cleaning every other morning, had
the tea-leaves as a part of her remuneration, or as
a matter of course. What the charwoman did
with them her employer never inquired, although
she was always anxious to obtain them, and she
referred me to the poor woman in question. I
found her in a very clean apartment on the second
floor of a decent house in Somers-town; a strong
hale woman, with what may be called an industrious
look. She was middle-aged, and a widow,
with one daughter, then a nursemaid in the neighbourhood,
and had regular employment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I get the tea-leaves whenever
I can, and the most at two coffee-shops that
I work at, but neither of them have so many as
they used to have. I think it’s because cocoa’s
come so much to be asked for in them, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
they sell less tea. I buy tea-leaves only at one
place. It’s a very large family, and I give the
servant 4<i>d.</i> and sometimes 3<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> a fortnight
for them, but I’m nothing in pocket, for the
young girl is a bit of a relation of mine, and it’s
like a trifle of pocket-money for her. She gives a
penny every time she goes to her chapel, and so
do I; there’s a box for it fixed near the door. O
yes, her mistress knows I buy them, for her
mistress knew me before she was married, and
that’s about 15 or 16 years since. When I’ve
got this basin (producing it) full I sell it, generally
for 4<i>d.</i> I don’t know what the leaves in it will
weigh, and I have never sold them by weight, but
I believe some have. Perhaps they might weigh,
as damp as some of them are, about a pound. I
sell them to a chandler now. I have sold them to a
rag-and-bottle-shop. I’ve had men and women call
upon me and offer to buy them, but not lately, and
I never liked the looks of them, and never sold
them any. I don’t know what they’re wanted
for, but I’ve heard that they’re mixed with new
tea. I have nothing to do with that. I get them
honestly and sell them honestly, and that’s all I
can say about it. Every little helps, and if rich
people won’t pay poor people properly, then poor
people can’t be expected to be very nice. But I
don’t complain, and that’s all I know about it.”</p>

<p>The chandler in question knew nothing of the
trade in tea-leaves, he said; he bought none, and
he did not know that any of the shopkeepers did,
and he could not form a notion what they could
be wanted for, if it wasn’t to sweep carpets!</p>

<p>This mode of buying or collecting is, I am
told the commonest mode of any, and it certainly
presents some peculiarities. The leaves which
are to form the spurious tea are collected, in
great measure, by a class who are perhaps more
likely than any other to have themselves to
buy and drink the stuff which they have helped
to produce! By charwomen and washer-women
a “nice cup of tea” in the afternoon during
their work is generally classed among the
comforts of existence, yet they are the very persons
who sell the tea-leaves which are to make
their “much prized beverage.” It is curious
to reflect also, that as tea-leaves are used indiscriminately
for being re-made into what is considered
new tea, what must be the strength of our
tea in a few years. Now all housewives complain
that twice the quantity of tea is required to make
the infusion of the same strength as formerly, and
if the collection of old tea-leaves continues, and the
refuse leaves are to be dried and re-dried perpetually,
surely we must get to use pounds where
we now do ounces.</p>

<p>A man formerly in the tea-leaf business, and
very anxious not to be known&mdash;but upon whose
information, I am assured from a respectable
source, full reliance may be placed&mdash;gave me the
following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My father kept a little shop in the general
line, and I helped him; so I was partly brought
up to the small way. But I was adrift by myself
when I was quite young&mdash;18 or so perhaps.
I can read and write well enough, but I was
rather of too gay a turn to be steady. Besides,
father was very poor at times, and could seldom
pay me anything, if I worked ever so. He was
very fond of his belly too, and I’ve known him,
when he’s had a bit of luck, or a run of business,
go and stuff hisself with fat roast pork at a
cook-shop till he could hardly waddle, and then
come home and lock hisself upstairs in his bed-room
and sleep three parts of the afternoon. (My
mother was dead.) But father was a kind-hearted
man for all that, and for all his roast pork, was as
thin as a whipping-post. I kept myself when I
left him, just off and on like, by collecting
grease, and all that; it can’t be done so easy now,
I fancy; so I got into the tea-leaf business, but
father had nothing to do with it. An elderly
sort of a woman who I met with in my collecting,
and who seemed to take a sort of fancy to me, put
me up to the leaves. She was an out-and-out
hand at anything that way herself. Then I bought
tea-leaves with other things, for I suppose for four
or five years. How long ago is it? O, never
mind, sir, a few years. I bought them at many
sorts of houses, and carried a box of needles, and
odds and ends, as a sort of introduction. There
wasn’t much of that wanted though, for I called,
when I could, soon in the mornings before the
family was up, and some ladies don’t get up till
10 or 11 you know. The masters wasn’t much;
it was the mistresses I cared about, because they
are often such Tartars to the maids and always
a-poking in the way.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to do business in the great lords’
houses in the squares and about the parks, but
there was mostly somebody about there to hinder
you. Besides, the servants in such places are
often on board wages, and often, when they’re
not on board wages, find their own tea and sugar,
and little of the tea-leaves is saved when every
one has a separate pot of tea; so there’s no good
to be done there. Large houses in trade where
a number of young men is boarded, drapers or
grocers, is among the best places, as there is often a
housekeeper there to deal with, and no mistress
to bother. I always bought by the lot. If you
offered to weigh you would not be able to clear
anything, as they’d be sure to give the leaves a
extra wetting. I put handfulls of the leaves to
my nose, and could tell from the smell whether
they were hard drawn or not. When they isn’t
hard drawn they answer best, and them I put
to one side. I had a bag like a lawyer’s blue
bag, with three divisions in it, to put my leaves
into, and so keep them ’sunder. Yes, I’ve bought
of charwomen, but somehow I think they did’nt
much admire selling to me. I hardly know how
I made them out, but one told me of another.
They like the shops better for their leaves, I
think; because they can get a bit of cheese, or
snuff, or candles for them there; though I don’t
know much about the shop-work in this line.
I’ve often been tried to be took in by the servants.
I’ve found leaves in the lot offered to
me to buy what was all dusty, and had been used
for sweeping; and if I’d sold them with my
stock they’d have been stopped out of the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
money. I’ve had tea-leaves given me by servants
oft enough, for I used to sweetheart them a bit,
just to get over them; and they’ve laughed, and
asked me whatever I could want with them. As
for price, why, I judged what a lot was worth,
and gave accordingly&mdash;from 1<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> I never
gave more than 1<i>s.</i> for any one lot at a time, and
that had been put to one side for me in a large
concern, for about a fortnight I suppose. I can’t
say how many people had been tea’d on them.
If it was a housekeeper, or anybody that way,
that I bought of, there was never anything said
about what they was wanted for. What <i>did</i> I
want them for? Why, to sell again; and though
him as I sold them to never said so, I knew they
was to dry over again. I know nothing about
who he was, or where he lived. The woman I
told you of sent him to me. I suppose I cleared
about 10<i>s.</i> a week on them, and did a little in
other things beside; perhaps I cleared rather
more than 10<i>s.</i> on leaves some weeks, and 5<i>s.</i> at
others. The party as called upon me once a week
to buy my leaves was a very polite man, and seemed
quite the gentleman. There was no weighing.
He examined the lot, and said ‘so much.’ He
wouldn’t stand ’bating, or be kept haggling; and
his money was down, and no nonsense. What
cost me 5<i>s.</i> I very likely got three half-crowns
for. It was no great trade, if you consider the
trouble. I’ve sometimes carried the leaves that
he’d packed in papers, and put into a carpet-bag,
where there was others, to a coffee-shop; they
always had ‘till called for’ marked on a card
then. I asked no questions, but just left them.
There was two, and sometimes four boys, as used
to bring me leaves on Saturday nights. I think
they was charwomen’s sons, but I don’t know for
a positive, and I don’t know how they made me
out. I think I was one of the tip-tops of the
trade at one time; some weeks I’ve laid out a
sov. (sovereign) in leaves. I haven’t a notion
how many’s in the line, or what’s doing now;
but much the same I’ve no doubt. I’m glad
<i>I’ve</i> done with it.”</p>

<p>I am told by those who are as well-informed on
the subject as is perhaps possible, when a surreptitious
and dishonest traffic is the subject of inquiry,
that although less spurious tea is sold, there are
more makers of it. Two of the principal manufacturers
have of late, however, been prevented
carrying on the business by the intervention of
the excise officers. The spurious tea-men are
also the buyers of “wrecked tea,” that is, of tea
which has been part of the salvage of a wrecked
vessel, and is damaged or spoiled entirely by
the salt water. This is re-dried and dyed, so as
to appear fresh and new. It is dyed with
Prussian blue, which gives it what an extensive
tea-dealer described to me as an “intensely
fine green.” It is then mixed with the
commonest Gunpowder teas and with the strongest
Young Hysons, and has always a kind of “metallic”
smell, somewhat like that of a copper
vessel after friction in its cleaning. These teas are
usually sold at 4<i>s.</i> the pound.</p>

<p>Sloe-leaves for spurious tea, as I have before
stated, were in extensive use, but this manufacture
ceased to exist about 20 years ago. Now
the spurious material consists only of the old tea-leaves,
at least so far as experienced tradesmen
know. The adulteration is, however, I am assured,
more skilfully conducted than it used to
be, and its staple is of far easier procuration.
The law, though it makes the use of old tea-leaves,
as components of what is called tea,
punishable, is nevertheless silent as to their sale
or purchase; they can be collected, therefore, with
a comparative impunity.</p>

<p>The tea-leaves are dried, dyed (or re-dyed),
and shrivelled on plates of hot metal, carefully
tended. The dyes used are those I have mentioned.
These teas, when mixed, are hawked in
the country, but not in town, and are sold to the
hawkers at 7 lbs. for 21<i>s.</i> The quarters of
pounds are retailed at 1<i>s.</i> A tea-dealer told me
that he could recognise this adulterated commodity,
but it was only a person skilled in teas who
could do so, by its <i>coarse</i> look. For green tea&mdash;the
mixture to which the prepared leaves are mostly
devoted&mdash;the old tea is blended with the commonest
Gunpowders and Hysons. No dye, I am
told, is required when black tea is thus re-made;
but I know that plumbago is often used to simulate
the bloom. The inferior shopkeepers sell
this adulterated tea, especially in neighbourhoods
where the poor Irish congregate, or any of the
lowest class of the poor English.</p>

<p>To obtain the statistics of a trade which exists
in spite not only of the vigilance of the excise
and police officers but of public reprobation, and
which is essentially a secret trade, is not possible.
I heard some, who were likely to be well-informed,
conjecture&mdash;for it cannot honestly be called
more than a conjecture&mdash;that between 500 and
1000 lbs., perhaps 700 lbs., of old tea-leaves were
made up weekly in London; but of this he
thought that about an eighth was spoilt by burning
in the process of drying.</p>

<p>Another gentleman, however, thought that, at
the very least, double the above quantity of old
tea-leaves was weekly manufactured into new
tea. According to his estimate, and he was no
mean authority, no less than 1500 lbs. weekly,
or 78,000 lbs. per annum of this trash are yearly
poured into the London market. The average
consumption of tea is about 1&frac14; lb. per annum for
each man, woman, or child in the kingdom;
coffee being the <i>principal</i> unfermented beverage
of the poor. Those, however, of the poorest who
drink tea consume about two ounces per week
(half an ounce serving them twice), or one pound
in the course of every two months. This makes
the annual consumption of the adult tea-drinking
poor amount to 6 lbs., and it is upon this class
the spurious tea is chiefly foisted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="OF_THE_STREET-FINDERS_OR_COLLECTORS"></a>OF THE STREET-FINDERS OR COLLECTORS.</h2>

</div>

<p>These men, for by far the great majority are men,
may be divided, according to the nature of their
occupations, into three <span class="lock">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers, who
are, indeed, the same individuals, the pure-finders,
and the cigar-end and old wood collectors.</p>

<p>2. The dredgermen, the mud-larks, and the
sewer-hunters.</p>

<p>3. The dustmen and nightmen, the sweeps and
the scavengers.</p>

<p>The first class go abroad daily to <i>find</i> in the
streets, and carry away with them such things as
bones, rags, “pure” (or dogs’-dung), which no one
appropriates. These they sell, and on that sale
support a wretched life. The second class of
people are also as strictly <i>finders</i>; but their industry,
or rather their labour, is confined to the
river, or to that subterranean city of sewerage
unto which the Thames supplies the great outlets.
These persons may not be immediately connected
with the <i>streets</i> of London, but their pursuits are
carried on in the open air (if the sewer-air may
be so included), and are all, at any rate, out-of-door
avocations. The third class is distinct from
either of these, as the labourers comprised in it
are not finders, but <i>collectors</i> or <i>removers</i> of the
dirt and filth of our streets and houses, and of the
soot of our chimneys.</p>

<p>The two first classes also differ from the third
in the fact that the sweeps, dustmen, scavengers,
&amp;c., are paid (and often large sums) for the removal
of the refuse they collect; whereas the
bone-grubbers, and mud-larks, and pure-finders,
and dredgermen, and sewer-hunters, get for their
pains only the value of the articles they gather.</p>

<p>Herein, too, lies a broad distinction between the
street-finder, or collector, and the street-buyer:
though both deal principally with refuse, the
buyer <i>pays</i> for what he is permitted to take away;
whereas the finder or collector is either paid (like
the sweep), or else he neither pays nor is paid
(like the bone-grubber), for the refuse that he
removes.</p>

<p>The third class of street-collectors also presents
another and a markedly distinctive characteristic.
They act in the capacity of servants, and do not
depend upon chance for the result of their day’s
labour, but are put to stated tasks, being employed
and paid a fixed sum for their work. To this
description, however, some of the sweeps present an
exception; as when the sweep works on his own
account, or, as it is worded, “is his own master.”</p>

<p>The public health requires the periodical cleaning
of the streets, and the removal of the refuse
matter from our dwellings; and the man who contracts
to carry on this work is decidedly a street-collector;
for on what he collects or removes depends
the amount of his remuneration. Thus a wealthy
contractor for the public scavengery, is as entirely
one of the street-folk as the unskilled and ignorant
labourer he employs. The master lives,
and, in many instances, has become rich, on the
results of his street employment; for, of course,
the actual workmen are but as the agents or
sources of his profit. Even the collection of
“pure” (dogs’-dung) in the streets, if conducted
by the servants of any tanner or leather dresser,
either for the purposes of his own trade or for
sale to others, might be the occupation of a wealthy
man, deriving a small profit from the labour of
each particular collector. The same may also be
said of bone-grubbing, or any similar occupation,
however insignificant, and now abandoned to the
outcast.</p>

<p>Were the collection of mud and dust carried on
by a number of distinct individuals&mdash;that is to
say, were each individual dustman and scavenger
to collect on his own account, there is no doubt
that no <i>one man</i> could amass a fortune by such
means&mdash;while if the collection of bones and rags
and even dogs’-dung were carried on “in the large
way,” that is to say, by a number of individual
collectors working for one “head man,” even the
picking up of the most abject refuse of the metropolis
might become the source of great riches.</p>

<p>The bone-grubber and the mud-lark (the
searcher for refuse on the banks of the river)
differ little in their pursuits or in their characteristics,
excepting that the mud-larks are generally
boys, which is more an accidental than a definite
distinction. The grubbers are with a few exceptions
stupid, unconscious of their degradation, and
with little anxiety to be relieved from it. They
are usually taciturn, but this taciturn habit is
common to men whose callings, if they cannot be
called solitary, are pursued with little communication
with others. I was informed by a man
who once kept a little beer-shop near Friar-street,
Southwark Bridge-road (where then and still, he
thought, was a bone-grinding establishment), that
the bone-grubbers who carried their sacks of bones
thither sometimes had a pint of beer at his house
when they had received their money. They
usually sat, he told me, silently looking at the
corners of the floor&mdash;for they rarely lifted their
eyes up&mdash;as if they were expecting to see some bones
or refuse there available for their bags. Of this
inertion, perhaps fatigue and despair may be a
part. I asked some questions of a man of this
class whom I saw pick up in a road in the suburbs
something that appeared to have been a coarse
canvas apron, although it was wet after a night’s
rain and half covered with mud. I inquired of
him what he thought about when he trudged along
looking on the ground on every side. His answer
was, “Of nothing, sir.” I believe that no better
description could be given of that vacuity of mind
or mental inactivity which seems to form a part
of the most degraded callings. The minds of such
men, even without an approach to idiotcy, appear
to be a blank. One characteristic of these poor
fellows, bone-grubbers and mud-larks, is that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
are very poor, although I am told some of them,
the older men, have among the poor the reputation
of being misers. It is not unusual for the
youths belonging to these callings to live with
their parents and give them the amount of their
earnings.</p>

<p>The sewer-hunters are again distinct, and a far
more intelligent and adventurous class; but they
work in gangs. They must be familiar with the
course of the tides, or they might be drowned at
high water. They must have quick eyes too, not
merely to descry the objects of their search, but
to mark the points and bearings of the subterraneous
roads they traverse; in a word, “to know
their way underground.” There is, moreover,
some spirit of daring in venturing into a dark,
solitary sewer, the chart being only in the memory,
and in braving the possibility of noxious vapours,
and the by no means insignificant dangers of the
rats infesting these places.</p>

<p>The dredgermen, the finders of the water, are
again distinct, as being watermen, and working in
boats. In some foreign parts, in Naples, for instance,
men carrying on similar pursuits are also
divers for anything lost in the bay or its confluent
waters. One of these men, known some years
ago as “the Fish,” could remain (at least, so say
those whom there is no reason to doubt) three
hours under the water without rising to the surface
to take breath. He was, it is said, web-footed,
naturally, and partially web-fingered. The
King of the Two Sicilies once threw a silver cup
into the sea for “the Fish” to bring up and retain
as a reward, but the poor diver was never seen
again. It was believed that he got entangled
among the weeds on the rocks, and so perished.
The dredgermen are necessarily well acquainted
with the sets of the tide and the course of
the currents in the Thames. Every one of
these men works on his own account, being as it
were a “small master,” which, indeed, is one of
the great attractions of open-air pursuits. The
dredgermen also depend for their maintenance
upon the sale of what they find, or the rewards
they receive.</p>

<p>It is otherwise, however, as was before observed,
with the third class of the street-finders, or rather
collectors. In all the capacities of dustmen,
nightmen, scavengers, and sweeps, the employers
of the men are <i>paid</i> to do the work, the proceeds
of the street-collection forming only a portion of
the employer’s remuneration. The sweep has the
soot in addition to his 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i>; the master
scavenger has a payment from the parish funds to
sweep the streets, though the clearance of the
cesspools, &amp;c., in private houses, may be an individual
bargain. The whole refuse of the
streets belongs to the contractor to make the best
of, but it must be cleared away, and so must the
contents of a dust-bin; for if a mass of dirt become
offensive, the householder may be indicted for a
nuisance, and municipal by-laws require its removal.
It is thus made a matter of compulsion
that the dust be removed from a private house;
but it is otherwise with the soot. Why a man
should be permitted to let soot accumulate in his
chimney&mdash;perhaps exposing himself, his family,
his lodgers, and his neighbours to the dangers of
fire, it may not be easy to account for, especially
when we bear in mind that the same man may not
accumulate cabbage-leaves and fish-tails in his yard.</p>

<p>The dustmen are of the plodding class of labourers,
mere labourers, who require only bodily
power, and possess little or no mental development.
Many of the agricultural labourers are of
this order, and the dustman often seems to be the
stolid ploughman, modified by a residence in a
city, and engaged in a peculiar calling. They are
generally uninformed, and no few of them are
dustmen because their fathers were. The same
may be said of nightmen and scavengers. At one
time it was a popular, or rather a vulgar notion
that many dustmen had become possessed of large
sums, from the plate, coins, and valuables they
found in clearing the dust-bins&mdash;a manifest
absurdity; but I was told by a marine-store
dealer that he had known a young woman, a
dustman’s daughter, sell silver spoons to a neighbouring
marine-store man, who was “not very
particular.”</p>

<p>The circumstances and character of the chimney-sweeps
have, since Parliament “put down” the
climbing boys, undergone considerable change.
The sufferings of many of the climbing boys were
very great. They were often ill-lodged, ill-fed,
barely-clad, forced to ascend hot and narrow flues,
and subject to diseases&mdash;such as the chimney-sweep’s
cancer&mdash;peculiar to their calling. The
child hated his trade, and was easily tempted to
be a thief, for prison was an asylum; or he grew
up a morose tyrannical fellow as journeyman or
master. Some of the young sweeps became very
bold thieves and house-breakers, and the most
remarkable, as far as personal daring is concerned:
the boldest feat of escape from Newgate was performed
by a youth who had been brought up a
chimney-sweep. He climbed up the two bare
rugged walls of a corner of the interior of the
prison, in the open air, to the height of some 60
feet. He had only the use of his hands, knees,
and feet, and a single slip, from fear or pain,
would have been death; he surmounted a parapet
after this climbing, and gained the roof, but was
recaptured before he could get clear away. He
was, moreover, a sickly, and reputed a cowardly,
young man, and ended his career in this country
by being transported.</p>

<p>A master sweep, now in middle age, and a man
“well to do,” told me that when a mere child he
had been apprenticed out of the workhouse to a
sweep, such being at that time a common occurrence.
He had undergone, he said, great hardships while
learning his business, and was long, from the indifferent
character of his class, ashamed of being
a sweep, both as journeyman and master; but the
sweeps were so much improved in character now,
that he no longer felt himself disgraced in his
calling.</p>

<p>The sweeps are more intelligent than the mere
ordinary labourers I have written of under this
head, but they are, of course, far from being an
educated body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The further and more minute characteristics of
the curious class of street-finders or collectors will
be found in the particular details and statements.</p>

<p>Among the finders there is perhaps the greatest
poverty existing, they being the very lowest class
of all the street-people. Many of the very old
live on the hard dirty crusts they pick up out of
the roads in the course of their rounds, washing
them and steeping them in water before they eat
them. Probably that vacuity of mind which is a
distinguishing feature of the class is the mere
atony or emaciation of the mental faculties proceeding
from&mdash;though often producing in the want
of energy that it necessarily begets&mdash;the extreme
wretchedness of the class. But even their liberty
and a crust&mdash;as it frequently literally is&mdash;appears
preferable to these people to the restrictions of
the workhouse. Those who are unable to comprehend
the inertia of both body and mind begotten
by the despair of long-continued misfortune
are referred to page 357 of the first volume of this
work, where it will be found that a tinman, in
speaking of the misery connected with the early
part of his street-career, describes the effect of
extreme want as producing not only an absence of
all hope, but even of a desire to better the condition.
Those, however, who have studied the
mysterious connection between body and mind,
and observed what different creatures they themselves
are before and after dinner, can well understand
that a long-continued deficiency of food
must have the same weakening effect on the muscles
of the mind and energy of the thoughts and will,
as it has on the limbs themselves.</p>

<p>Occasionally it will be found that the utter
abjectness of the bone-grubbers has arisen from
the want of energy begotten by intemperate
habits. The workman has nothing but this same
energy to live upon, and the permanent effect of
stimulating liquors is to produce an amount of depression
corresponding to the excitement momentarily
caused by them in the frame. The operative,
therefore, who spends his earnings on “drink,”
not only squanders them on a brutalising luxury,
but deprives himself of the power, and consequently
of the disposition, to work for more, and
hence that idleness, carelessness, and neglect which
are the distinctive qualities of the drunkard,
and sooner or later compass his ruin.</p>

<p>For the poor wretched children who are reared
to this the lowest trade of all, surely even the
most insensible and unimaginative must feel the
acutest pity. There is, however, this consolation:
I have heard of none, with the exception of the
more prosperous sewer-hunters and dredgermen,
who have remained all their lives at street-finding.
Still there remains much to be done by all those
who are impressed with a sense of the trust that
has been confided to them, in the possession of those
endowments which render their lot in this world
so much more easy than that of the less lucky
street-finders.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bone-Grubbers and Rag-Gatherers.</span></h3>

<p>The habits of the bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers,
the “pure,” or dogs’-dung collectors, and the
cigar-end finders, are necessarily similar. All
lead a wandering, unsettled sort of life, being
compelled to be continually on foot, and to travel
many miles every day in search of the articles in
which they deal. They seldom have any fixed
place of abode, and are mostly to be found at
night in one or other of the low lodging-houses
throughout London. The majority are, moreover,
persons who have been brought up to other employments,
but who from some failing or mishap
have been reduced to such a state of distress that
they were obliged to take to their present occupation,
and have never after been able to get away
from it.</p>

<p>Of the whole class it is considered that there
are from 800 to 1000 resident in London, one-half
of whom, at the least, sleep in the cheap
lodging-houses. The Government returns estimate
the number of mendicants’ lodging-houses
in London to be upwards of 200. Allowing two
bone-grubbers and pure-finders to frequent each
of these lodging-houses, there will be upwards of
400 availing themselves of such nightly shelters.
As many more, I am told, live in garrets and
ill-furnished rooms in the lowest neighbourhoods.
There is no instance on record of any of the class
renting even the smallest house for himself.</p>

<p>Moreover there are in London during the
winter a number of persons called “trampers,”
who employ themselves at that season in street-finding.
These people are in the summer country
labourers of some sort, but as soon as the harvest
and potato-getting and hop-picking are over, and
they can find nothing else to do in the country,
they come back to London to avail themselves of
the shelter of the night asylums or refuges for the
destitute (usually called “straw-yards” by the
poor), for if they remained in the provinces at
that period of the year they would be forced to
have recourse to the unions, and as they can only
stay one night in each place they would be
obliged to travel from ten to fifteen miles per
day, to which in the winter they have a strong
objection. They come up to London in the
winter, not to look for any regular work or employment,
but because they know that they can
have a nightly shelter, and bread night and
morning for nothing, during that season, and can
during the day collect bones, rags, &amp;c. As soon
as the “straw-yards” close, which is generally
about the beginning of April, the “trampers”
again start off to the country in small bands of
two or three, and without any fixed residence
keep wandering about all the summer, sometimes
begging their way through the villages and sleeping
in the casual wards of the unions, and sometimes,
when hard driven, working at hay-making
or any other light labour.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE BONE-GRUBBER.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>Those among the bone-grubbers who do not
belong to the regular “trampers” have been
either navvies, or men who have not been able
to obtain employment at their own business, and
have been driven to it by necessity as a means of
obtaining a little bread for the time being, and
without any intention of pursuing the calling
regularly; but, as I have said, when once in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
business they cannot leave it, for at least they
make certain of getting a few halfpence by it, and
their present necessity does not allow them time
to look after other employment. There are many
of the street-finders who are old men and women,
and many very young children who have no other
means of living. Since the famine in Ireland
vast numbers of that unfortunate people, particularly
boys and girls, have been engaged in gathering
bones and rags in the streets.</p>

<p>The bone-picker and rag-gatherer may be known
at once by the greasy bag which he carries on his
back. Usually he has a stick in his hand, and
this is armed with a spike or hook, for the purpose
of more easily turning over the heaps of
ashes or dirt that are thrown out of the houses,
and discovering whether they contain anything
that is saleable at the rag-and-bottle or marine-store
shop. The bone-grubber generally seeks out
the narrow back streets, where dust and refuse
are cast, or where any dust-bins are accessible.
The articles for which he chiefly searches are rags
and bones&mdash;rags he prefers&mdash;but waste metal,
such as bits of lead, pewter, copper, brass, or old
iron, he prizes above all. Whatever he meets
with that he knows to be in any way saleable he
puts into the bag at his back. He often finds large
lumps of bread which have been thrown out as
waste by the servants, and occasionally the housekeepers
will give him some bones on which there
is a little meat remaining; these constitute the
morning meal of most of the class. One of my
informants had a large rump of beef bone given to
him a few days previous to my seeing him, on
which “there was not less than a pound of
meat.”</p>

<p>The bone-pickers and rag-gatherers are all early
risers. They have all their separate beats or districts,
and it is most important to them that they
should reach their district before any one else of
the same class can go over the ground. Some of
the beats lie as far as Peckham, Clapham, Hammersmith,
Hampstead, Bow, Stratford, and indeed
all parts within about five miles of London. In
summer time they rise at two in the morning,
and sometimes earlier. It is not quite light at
this hour&mdash;but bones and rags can be discovered
before daybreak. The “grubbers” scour all
quarters of London, but abound more particularly
in the suburbs. In the neighbourhood of
Petticoat-lane and Ragfair, however, they are the
most numerous on account of the greater quantity
of rags which the Jews have to throw out. It
usually takes the bone-picker from seven to nine
hours to go over his rounds, during which time
he travels from 20 to 30 miles with a quarter
to a half hundredweight on his back. In the
summer he usually reaches home about eleven
of the day, and in the winter about one or two.
On his return home he proceeds to sort the contents
of his bag. He separates the rags from the
bones, and these again from the old metal (if he
be lucky enough to have found any). He divides
the rags into various lots, according as they are
white or coloured; and if he have picked up any
pieces of canvas or sacking, he makes these also
into a separate parcel. When he has finished
the sorting he takes his several lots to the rag-shop
or the marine-store dealer, and realizes upon
them whatever they may be worth. For the
white rags he gets from 2<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> per pound,
according as they are clean or soiled. The white
rags are very difficult to be found; they are mostly
very dirty, and are therefore sold with the coloured
ones at the rate of about 5 lbs. for 2<i>d.</i> The
bones are usually sold with the coloured rags
at one and the same price. For fragments of
canvas or sacking the grubber gets about three-farthings
a pound; and old brass, copper, and
pewter about 4<i>d.</i> (the marine-store keepers say
5<i>d.</i>), and old iron one farthing per pound, or six
pounds for 1<i>d.</i> The bone-grubber thinks he has
done an excellent day’s work if he can earn 8<i>d.</i>;
and some of them, especially the very old and the
very young, do not earn more than from 2<i>d.</i> to
3<i>d.</i> a day. To make 10<i>d.</i> a day, at the present
price of rags and bones, a man must be remarkably
active and strong,&mdash;“ay! and lucky, too,”
adds my informant. The average amount of earnings,
I am told, varies from about 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per
day, or from 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> a week; and the highest
amount that a man, the most brisk and persevering
at the business, can by any possibility earn in
one week is about 5<i>s.</i>, but this can only be accomplished
by great good fortune and industry&mdash;the
usual weekly gains are about half that sum. In
bad weather the bone-grubber cannot do so well,
because the rags are wet, and then they cannot
sell them. The majority pick up bones only in
wet weather; those who <i>do</i> gather rags during
or after rain are obliged to wash and dry them
before they can sell them. The state of the
shoes of the rag and bone-picker is a very important
matter to him; for if he be well shod he can
get quickly over the ground; but he is frequently
lamed, and unable to make any progress from the
blisters and gashes on his feet, occasioned by the
want of proper shoes.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bone-grubbers will pick up a
stray sixpence or a shilling that has been dropped
in the street. “The handkerchief I have round
my neck,” said one whom I saw, “I picked up
with 1<i>s.</i> in the corner. The greatest prize I
ever found was the brass cap of the nave of a
coach-wheel; and I <i>did</i> once find a quarter of a
pound of tobacco in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. The
best bit of luck of all that I ever had was finding
a cheque for 12<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> lying in the gateway of the
mourning-coach yard in Titchborne-street, Haymarket.
I was going to light my pipe with it,
indeed I picked it up for that purpose, and then
saw it was a cheque. It was on the London and
County Bank, 21, Lombard-street. I took it
there, and got 10<i>s.</i> for finding it. I went there
in my rags, as I am now, and the cashier stared
a bit at me. The cheque was drawn by a Mr.
Knibb, and payable to a Mr. Cox. I <i>did</i> think I
should have got the odd 15<i>s.</i> though.”</p>

<p>It has been stated that the average amount of
the earnings of the bone-pickers is 6<i>d.</i> per day, or
3<i>s.</i> per week, being 7<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> per annum for each
person. It has also been shown that the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of persons engaged in the business may be estimated
at about 800; hence the earnings of the
entire number will amount to the sum of 20<i>l.</i> per
day, or 120<i>l.</i> per week, which gives 6240<i>l.</i> as the
annual earnings of the bone-pickers and rag-gatherers
of London. It may also be computed
that each of the grubbers gathers on an average
20 lbs. weight of bone and rags; and reckoning
the bones to constitute three-fourths of the entire
weight, we thus find that the gross quantity of
these articles gathered by the street-finders in the
course of the year, amounts to 3,744,000 lbs. of
bones, and 1,240,000 lbs. of rags.</p>

<p>Between the London and St. Katherine’s Docks
and Rosemary Lane, there is a large district inter-laced
with narrow lanes, courts, and alleys ramifying
into each other in the most intricate and disorderly
manner, insomuch that it would be no
easy matter for a stranger to work his way through
the interminable confusion without the aid of a
guide, resident in and well conversant with the
locality. The houses are of the poorest description,
and seem as if they tumbled into their places at
random. Foul channels, huge dust-heaps, and a
variety of other unsightly objects, occupy every
open space, and dabbling among these are crowds
of ragged dirty children who grub and wallow, as if
in their native element. None reside in these places
but the poorest and most wretched of the population,
and, as might almost be expected, this, the
cheapest and filthiest locality of London, is the
head-quarters of the bone-grubbers and other
street-finders. I have ascertained on the best authority,
that from the centre of this place, within
a circle of a mile in diameter, there dwell not
less than 200 persons of this class. In this quarter
I found a bone-grubber who gave me the following
account of <span class="lock">himself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was born in Liverpool, and when about 14
years of age, my father died. He used to work about
the Docks, and I used to run on errands for any
person who wanted me. I managed to live by
this after my father’s death for three or four
years. I had a brother older than myself, who
went to France to work on the railroads, and when
I was about 18 he sent for me, and got me to work
with himself on the Paris and Rouen Railway,
under McKenzie and Brassy, who had the contract.
I worked on the railroads in France for
four years, till the disturbance broke out, and then
we all got notice to leave the country. I lodged
at that time with a countryman, and had 12<i>l.</i>,
which I had saved out of my earnings. This sum
I gave to my countryman to keep for me till we got
to London, as I did not like to have it about me,
for fear I’d lose it. The French people paid our
fare from Rouen to Havre by the railway, and
there put us on board a steamer to Southampton.
There was about 50 of us altogether. When
we got to Southampton, we all went before the
mayor; we told him about how we had been
driven out of France, and he gave us a shilling a
piece; he sent some one with us, too, to get us a
lodging, and told us to come again the next day.
In the morning the mayor gave every one who
was able to walk half-a-crown, and for those who
were not able he paid their fare to London on the
railroad. I had a sore leg at the time, and I came
up by the train, and when I gave up my ticket at
the station, the gentleman gave me a shilling more.
I couldn’t find the man I had given my money to,
because he had walked up; and I went before the
Lord Mayor to ask his advice; he gave me 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
I looked for work everywhere, but could get
nothing to do; and when the 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was all
spent, I heard that the man who had my money
was on the London and York Railway in the
country; however, I couldn’t get that far for
want of money then; so I went again before the
Lord Mayor, and he gave me two more, but
told me not to trouble him any further. I told
the Lord Mayor about the money, and then he sent
an officer with me, who put me into a carriage on
the railway. When I got down to where the
man was at work, he wouldn’t give me a farthing;
I had given him the money without any witness
bring present, and he said I could do nothing,
because it was done in another country. I staid
down there more than a week trying to get work
on the railroad, but could not. I had no money
and was nearly starved, when two or three took
pity on me, and made up four or five shillings for
me, to take me back again to London. I tried all
I could to get something to do, till the money was
nearly gone; and then I took to selling lucifers,
and the fly-papers that they use in the shops, and
little things like that; but I could do no good at
this work, there was too many at it before me,
and they knew more about it than I did. At
last, I got so bad off I didn’t know what to do;
but seeing a great many about here gathering
bones and rags, I thought I’d do so too&mdash;a poor
fellow must do something. I was advised to do
so, and I have been at it ever since. I forgot to
tell you that my brother died in France. We had
good wages there, four francs a day, or 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
English; I don’t make more than 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> and
sometimes 6<i>d.</i> a day at bone-picking. I don’t go
out before daylight to gather anything, because
the police takes my bag and throws all I’ve gathered
about the street to see if I have anything
stolen in it. I never stole anything in all my life,
indeed I’d do anything before I’d steal. Many
a night I’ve slept under an arch of the railway
when I hadn’t a penny to pay for my bed; but
whenever the police find me that way, they make
me and the rest get up, and drive us on, and tell
us to keep moving. I don’t go out on wet days,
there’s no use in it, as the things won’t be bought.
I can’t wash and dry them, because I’m in a
lodging-house. There’s a great deal more than a
100 bone-pickers about here, men, women, and
children. The Jews in this lane and up in Petticoat-lane
give a good deal of victuals away on the
Saturday. They sometimes call one of us in from
the street to light the fire for them, or take off the
kettle, as they must not do anything themselves
on the Sabbath; and then they put some food on
the footpath, and throw rags and bones into the
street for us, because they must not hand anything
to us. There are some about here who get a
couple of shillings’ worth of goods, and go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
board the ships in the Docks, and exchange them
for bones and bits of old canvas among the sailors;
I’d buy and do so too if I only had the money, but
can’t get it. The summer is the worst time for us,
the winter is much better, for there is more meat
used in winter, and then there are more bones.”
(Others say differently.) “I intend to go to the
country this season, and try to get something to
do at the hay-making and harvest. I make about
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, and the way I manage is this:
sometimes I get a piece of bread about 12 o’clock,
and I make my breakfast of that and cold water;
very seldom I have any dinner,&mdash;unless I earn 6<i>d.</i>
I can’t get any,&mdash;and then I have a basin of nice
soup, or a penn’orth of plum-pudding and a couple
of baked ’tatoes. At night I get &frac14;<i>d.</i> worth of
coffee, &frac12;<i>d.</i> worth of sugar, and 1&frac14;<i>d.</i> worth of
bread, and then I have 2<i>d.</i> a night left for my
lodging; I always try to manage that, for I’d do
anything sooner than stop out all night. I’m
always happy the day when I make 4<i>d.</i>, for then
I know I won’t have to sleep in the street. The
winter before last, there was a straw-yard down
in Black Jack’s-alley, where we used to go after
six o’clock in the evening, and get &frac12; lb. of bread,
and another &frac12; lb. in the morning, and then we’d
gather what we could in the daytime and buy
victuals with what we got for it. We were well
off then, but the straw-yard wasn’t open at all last
winter. There used to be 300 of us in there of a
night, a great many of the dock-labourers and their
families were there, for no work was to be got in
the docks; so they weren’t able to pay rent, and
were obliged to go in. I’ve lost my health since I
took to bone-picking, through the wet and cold in
the winter, for I’ve scarcely any clothes, and the
wet gets to my feet through the old shoes; this
caused me last winter to be nine weeks in the
hospital of the Whitechapel workhouse.”</p>

<p>The narrator of this tale seemed so dejected
and broken in spirit, that it was with difficulty
his story was elicited from him. He was evidently
labouring under incipient consumption. I
have every reason to believe that he made a
truthful statement,&mdash;indeed, he did not appear to
me to have sufficient intellect to invent a falsehood.
It is a curious fact, indeed, with reference
to the London street-finders generally, that they
seem to possess less rational power than any other
class. They appear utterly incapable of trading
even in the most trifling commodities, probably
from the fact that buying articles for the purpose
of selling them at a profit, requires an exercise of
the mind to which they feel themselves incapable.
Begging, too, requires some ingenuity or tact, in
order to move the sympathies of the well-to-do,
and the street-finders being incompetent for this,
they work on day after day as long as they are
able to crawl about in pursuit of their unprofitable
calling. This cannot be fairly said of the
younger members of this class, who are sent into
the streets by their parents, and many of whom
are afterwards able to find some more reputable
and more lucrative employment. As a body of
people, however, young and old, they mostly exhibit
the same stupid, half-witted appearance.</p>

<p>To show how bone-grubbers occasionally manage
to obtain shelter during the night, the following
incident may not be out of place. A few mornings
past I accidentally encountered one of this
class in a narrow back lane; his ragged coat&mdash;the
colour of the rubbish among which he toiled&mdash;was
greased over, probably with the fat of the bones he
gathered, and being mixed with the dust it seemed
as if the man were covered with bird-lime. His
shoes&mdash;torn and tied on his feet with pieces of cord&mdash;had
doubtlessly been picked out of some dust-bin,
while his greasy bag and stick unmistakably
announced his calling. Desirous of obtaining all
the information possible on this subject, I asked
him a few questions, took his address, which he
gave without hesitation, and bade him call on me
in the evening. At the time appointed, however,
he did not appear; on the following day therefore
I made way to the address he had given, and on
reaching the spot I was astonished to find the house
in which he had said he lived was uninhabited.
A padlock was on the door, the boards of which
were parting with age. There was not a whole
pane of glass in any of the windows, and the
frames of many of them were shattered or demolished.
Some persons in the neighbourhood,
noticing me eyeing the place, asked whom I
wanted. On my telling the man’s name, which it
appeared he had not dreamt of disguising, I was
informed that he had left the day before, saying he
had met the landlord in the morning (for such it
turned out he had fancied me to be), and that the
gentleman had wanted him to come to his house, but
he was afraid to go lest he should be sent to prison
for breaking into the place. I found, on inspection,
that the premises, though locked up, could
be entered by the rear, one of the window-frames
having been removed, so that admission could
be obtained through the aperture. Availing myself
of the same mode of ingress, I proceeded to
examine the premises. Nothing could well be
more dismal or dreary than the interior. The
floors were rotting with damp and mildew, especially
near the windows, where the wet found
easy entrance. The walls were even slimy and
discoloured, and everything bore the appearance
of desolation. In one corner was strewn a bundle
of dirty straw, which doubtlessly had served the
bone-grubber for a bed, while scattered about the
floor were pieces of bones, and small fragments of
dirty rags, sufficient to indicate the calling of the
late inmate. He had had but little difficulty in
removing his property, seeing that it consisted
solely of his bag and his stick.</p>

<p>The following paragraph concerning the chiffoniers
or rag-gatherers of Paris appeared in the
London journals a few weeks <span class="lock">since:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The fraternal association of rag-gatherers
(chiffoniers) gave a grand banquet on Saturday
last (21st of June). It took place at a public-house
called the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pot Tricolore</i>, near the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Barrière
de Fontainbleau</i>, which is frequented by the rag-gathering
fraternity. In this house there are
three rooms, each of which is specially devoted to
the use of different classes of rag-gatherers: one,
the least dirty, is called the ‘Chamber of Peers,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and is occupied by the first class&mdash;that is, those
who possess a basket in a good state, and a crook
ornamented with copper; the second, called the
‘Chamber of Deputies,’ belonging to the second
class, is much less comfortable, and those who
attend it have baskets and crooks not of first-rate
quality; the third room is in a dilapidated condition,
and is frequented by the lowest class of
rag-gatherers who have no basket or crook, and
who place what they find in the streets in a piece
of sackcloth. They call themselves the ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réunion
des Vrais Prolétaires</i>.’ The name of each room
is written in chalk above the door; and generally
such strict etiquette is observed among the rag-gatherers
that no one goes into the apartment not
occupied by his own class. At Saturday’s banquet,
however, all distinctions of rank were laid
aside, and delegates of each class united fraternally.
The president was the oldest rag-gatherer
in Paris; his age is 88, and he is called ‘the
Emperor.’ The banquet consisted of a sort of
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla podrida</i>, which the master of the establishment
pompously called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gibelotte</i>, though of what
animal it was composed it was impossible to say.
It was served up in huge earthen dishes, and
before it was allowed to be touched payment was
demanded and obtained; the other articles were
also paid for as soon as they were brought in;
and a deposit was exacted as a security for the
plates, knives, and forks. The wine, or what did
duty as such, was contained in an earthen pot
called the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit Père Noir</i>, and was filled from a
gigantic vessel named <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Moricaud</i>. The dinner
was concluded by each guest taking a small glass
of brandy. Business was then proceeded to.
It consisted in the reading and adoption of the
statutes of the association, followed by the drinking
of numerous toasts to the president, to the
prosperity of rag-gathering, to the union of rag-gatherers,
&amp;c. A collection amounting to 6<i>f.</i> 75<i>c.</i>
was raised for sick members of the fraternity.
The guests then dispersed; but several of them
remained at the counter until they had consumed
in brandy the amount deposited as security for
the crockery, knives, and forks.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Pure”-Finders.</span></h3>

<p>Dogs’-dung is called “Pure,” from its cleansing
and purifying properties.</p>

<p>The name of “Pure-finders,” however, has been
applied to the men engaged in collecting dogs’-dung
from the public streets only, within the last
20 or 30 years. Previous to this period there appears
to have been no men engaged in the business,
old women alone gathered the substance,
and they were known by the name of “bunters,”
which signifies properly gatherers of rags; and thus
plainly intimates that the rag-gatherers originally
added the collecting of “Pure” to their original
and proper vocation. Hence it appears that the
bone-grubbers, rag-gatherers, and pure-finders,
constituted formerly but one class of people, and
even now they have, as I have stated, kindred
characteristics.</p>

<p>The pure-finders meet with a ready market for all
the dogs’-dung they are able to collect, at the numerous
tanyards in Bermondsey, where they sell it by
the stable-bucket full, and get from 8<i>d.</i> to 10<i>d.</i>
per bucket, and sometimes 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for it,
according to its quality. The “dry limy-looking
sort” fetches the highest price at some yards, as it
is found to possess more of the alkaline, or purifying
properties; but others are found to prefer the
dark moist quality. Strange as it may appear,
the preference for a particular kind has suggested
to the finders of Pure the idea of adulterating it
to a very considerable extent; this is effected by
means of mortar broken away from old walls, and
mixed up with the whole mass, which it closely
resembles; in some cases, however, the mortar is
rolled into small balls similar to those found.
Hence it would appear, that there is no business
or trade, however insignificant or contemptible,
without its own peculiar and appropriate tricks.</p>

<p>The pure-finders are in their habits and mode
of proceeding nearly similar to the bone-grubbers.
Many of the pure-finders are, however, better in
circumstances, the men especially, as they earn
more money. They are also, to a certain extent,
a better educated class. Some of the regular collectors
of this substance have been mechanics, and
others small tradesmen, who have been reduced.
Those pure-finders who have “a good connection,”
and have been granted permission to cleanse some
kennels, obtain a very fair living at the business,
earning from 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a week. These, however,
are very few; the majority have to seek the
article in the streets, and by such means they
can obtain only from 6<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a week. The
average weekly earnings of this class are thought
to be about 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>From all the inquiries I have made on this subject,
I have found that there cannot be less than
from 200 to 300 persons constantly engaged solely
in this business. There are about 30 tanyards
large and small in Bermondsey, and these all have
their regular Pure collectors from whom they
obtain the article. Leomont and Roberts’s, Bavingtons’,
Beech’s, Murrell’s, Cheeseman’s, Powell’s,
Jones’s, Jourdans’, Kent’s, Moorcroft’s, and Davis’s,
are among the largest establishments, and some
idea of the amount of business done in some of
these yards may be formed from the fact, that the
proprietors severally employ from 300 to 500 tanners.
At Leomont and Roberts’s there are 23 regular
street-finders, who supply them with pure,
but this is a large establishment, and the number
supplying them is considered far beyond the
average quantity; moreover, Messrs. Leomont and
Roberts do more business in the particular branch
of tanning in which the article is principally used,
viz., in dressing the leather for book-covers, kid-gloves,
and a variety of other articles. Some of
the other tanyards, especially the smaller ones,
take the substance only as they happen to want it,
and others again employ but a limited number of
hands. If, therefore, we strike an average, and
reduce the number supplying each of the several
yards to eight, we shall have 240 persons regularly
engaged in the business: besides these, it
may be said that numbers of the starving and
destitute Irish have taken to picking up the ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>terial,
but not knowing where to sell it, or how to
dispose of it, they part with it for 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> the
pail-full to the regular purveyors of it to the tanyards,
who of course make a considerable profit
by the transaction. The children of the poor
Irish are usually employed in this manner, but
they also pick up rags and bones, and anything
else which may fall in their way.</p>

<p>I have stated that some of the pure-finders,
especially the men, earn a considerable sum of
money per week; their gains are sometimes as
much as 15<i>s.</i>; indeed I am assured that seven years
ago, when they got from 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> per pail for the
pure, that many of them would not exchange their
position with that of the best paid mechanic in
London. Now, however, the case is altered, for
there are twenty now at the business for every
one who followed it then; hence each collects
so much the less in quantity, and, moreover,
from the competition gets so much less for the
article. Some of the collectors at present do
not earn 3<i>s.</i> per week, but these are mostly old
women who are feeble and unable to get over the
ground quickly; others make 5<i>s.</i> and 6<i>s.</i> in the
course of the week, while the most active and
those who clean out the kennels of the dog fanciers
may occasionally make 9<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> and even 15<i>s.</i>
a week still, but this is of very rare occurrence.
Allowing the finders, one with the other, to earn
on an average 5<i>s.</i> per week, it would give the
annual earnings of each to be 13<i>l.</i>, while the
income of the whole 200 would amount to 50<i>l.</i> a
week, or 2600<i>l.</i> per annum. The kennel “pure”
is not much valued, indeed many of the tanners
will not even buy it, the reason is that the
dogs of the “fanciers” are fed on almost anything,
to save expense; the kennel cleaners consequently
take the precaution of mixing it with
what is found in the street, previous to offering it
for sale.</p>

<p>The pure-finder may at once be distinguished
from the bone-grubber and rag-gatherer; the
latter, as I have before mentioned, carries a bag,
and usually a stick armed with a spike, while he
is most frequently to be met with in back streets,
narrow lanes, yards and other places, where dust
and rubbish are likely to be thrown out from the
adjacent houses. The pure-finder, on the contrary,
is often found in the open streets, as dogs wander
where they like. The pure-finders always carry
a handle basket, generally with a cover, to hide
the contents, and have their right hand covered
with a black leather glove; many of them, however,
dispense with the glove, as they say it is
much easier to wash their hands than to keep the
glove fit for use. The women generally have a
large pocket for the reception of such rags as they
may chance to fall in with, but they pick up those
only of the very best quality, and will not go out
of their way to search even for them. Thus
equipped they may be seen pursuing their avocation
in almost every street in and about London,
excepting such streets as are now cleansed by
the “street orderlies,” of whom the pure-finders
grievously complain, as being an unwarrantable
interference with the privileges of their class.</p>

<p>The pure collected is used by leather-dressers
and tanners, and more especially by those engaged
in the manufacture of morocco and kid leather
from the skins of old and young goats, of which
skins great numbers are imported, and of the
roans and lambskins which are the sham morocco
and kids of the “slop” leather trade, and are
used by the better class of shoemakers, bookbinders,
and glovers, for the inferior requirements
of their business. Pure is also used by tanners,
as is pigeon’s dung, for the tanning of the thinner
kinds of leather, such as calf-skins, for which
purpose it is placed in pits with an admixture of
lime and bark.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of moroccos and roans the
pure is rubbed by the hands of the workman into
the skin he is dressing. This is done to “purify”
the leather, I was told by an intelligent leather-dresser,
and from that term the word “pure” has
originated. The dung has astringent as well as
highly alkaline, or, to use the expression of my
informant, “scouring,” qualities. When the pure
has been rubbed into the flesh and grain of the
skin (the “flesh” being originally the interior, and
the “grain” the exterior part of the cuticle), and
the skin, thus purified, has been hung up to be
dried, the dung removes, as it were, all such
moisture as, if allowed to remain, would tend to
make the leather unsound or imperfectly dressed.
This imperfect dressing, moreover, gives a disagreeable
smell to the leather&mdash;and leather-buyers
often use both nose and tongue in making their
purchases&mdash;and would consequently prevent that
agreeable odour being imparted to the skin which
is found in some kinds of morocco and kid. The
peculiar odour of the Russia leather, so agreeable
in the libraries of the rich, is derived from the
bark of young birch trees. It is now manufactured
in Bermondsey.</p>

<p>Among the morocco manufacturers, especially
among the old operatives, there is often a scarcity
of employment, and they then dress a few roans,
which they hawk to the cheap warehouses, or
sell to the wholesale shoemakers on their own
account. These men usually reside in small garrets
in the poorer parts of Bermondsey, and carry
on their trade in their own rooms, using and
keeping the pure there; hence the “homes” of
these poor men are peculiarly uncomfortable, if
not unhealthy. Some of these poor fellows or
their wives collect the pure themselves, often
starting at daylight for the purpose; they more
frequently, however, buy it of a regular finder.</p>

<p>The number of pure-finders I heard estimated,
by a man well acquainted with the tanning and
other departments of the leather trade, at from
200 to 250. The finders, I was informed by the
same person, collected about a pail-full a day, clearing
6<i>s.</i> a week in the summer&mdash;1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
being the charge for a pail-full; in the short days
of winter, however, and in bad weather, they
could not collect five pail-fulls in a week.</p>

<p>In the wretched locality already referred to as
lying between the Docks and Rosemary-lane, redolent
of filth and pregnant with pestilential diseases,
and whither all the outcasts of the metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
population seem to be drawn, either in the hope of
finding fitting associates and companions in their
wretchedness (for there is doubtlessly something
attractive and agreeable to them in such companionship),
or else for the purpose of hiding themselves
and their shifts and struggles for existence from the
world,&mdash;in this dismal quarter, and branching from
one of the many narrow lanes which interlace it,
there is a little court with about half-a-dozen
houses of the very smallest dimensions, consisting
of merely two rooms, one over the other. Here
in one of the upper rooms (the lower one of the
same house being occupied by another family and
apparently <i>filled</i> with little ragged children), I
discerned, after considerable difficulty, an old
woman, a Pure-finder. When I opened the door
the little light that struggled through the small
window, the many broken panes of which were
stuffed with old rags, was not sufficient to enable
me to perceive who or what was in the room.
After a short time, however, I began to make out
an old chair standing near the fire-place, and then
to discover a poor old woman resembling a bundle
of rags and filth stretched on some dirty straw in
the corner of the apartment. The place was bare
and almost naked. There was nothing in it except
a couple of old tin kettles and a basket, and
some broken crockeryware in the recess of the
window. To my astonishment I found this
wretched creature to be, to a certain extent, a
“superior” woman; she could read and write well,
spoke correctly, and appeared to have been a
person of natural good sense, though broken up
with age, want, and infirmity, so that she was
characterized by all that dull and hardened
stupidity of manner which I have noticed in the
class. She made the following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am about 60 years of age. My father was a
milkman, and very well off; he had a barn and a
great many cows. I was kept at school till I was
thirteen or fourteen years of age; about that
time my father died, and then I was taken home
to help my mother in the business. After a
while things went wrong; the cows began to die,
and mother, alleging she could not manage the
business herself, married again. I soon found out
the difference. Glad to get away, anywhere out
of the house, I married a sailor, and was very
comfortable with him for some years; as he made
short voyages, and was often at home, and always
left me half his pay. At last he was pressed,
when at home with me, and sent away; I forget
now where he was sent to, but I never saw him
from that day to this. The only thing I know is
that some sailors came to me four or five years
after, and told me that he deserted from the ship
in which he had gone out, and got on board the
<i>Neptune</i>, East Indiaman, bound for Bombay,
where he acted as boatswain’s mate; some
little time afterwards, he had got intoxicated
while the ship was lying in harbour, and, going
down the side to get into a bumboat, and buy more
drink, he had fallen overboard and was drowned.
I got some money that was due to him from the
India House, and, after that was all gone, I went
into service, in the Mile-end Road. There
I stayed for several years, till I met my second
husband, who was bred to the water, too, but as
a waterman on the river. We did very well
together for a long time, till he lost his health.
He became paralyzed like, and was deprived of
the use of all one side, and nearly lost the sight
of one of his eyes; this was not very conspicuous
at first, but when we came to get pinched,
and to be badly off, then any one might have seen
that there was something the matter with his
eye. Then we parted with everything we had in the
world; and, at last, when we had no other means
of living left, we were advised to take to gathering
‘Pure.’ At first I couldn’t endure the business; I
couldn’t bear to eat a morsel, and I was obliged to
discontinue it for a long time. My husband kept
at it though, for he could do <i>that</i> well enough,
only he couldn’t walk as fast as he ought. He
couldn’t lift his hands as high as his head, but he
managed to work under him, and so put the Pure
in the basket. When I saw that he, poor fellow,
couldn’t make enough to keep us both, I took
heart and went out again, and used to gather
more than he did; that’s fifteen years ago now;
the times were good then, and we used to do very
well. If we only gathered a pail-full in the day,
we could live very well; but we could do much
more than that, for there wasn’t near so many at
the business then, and the Pure was easier to be
had. For my part I can’t tell where all the poor
creatures have come from of late years; the world
seems growing worse and worse every day. They
have pulled down the price of Pure, that’s certain;
but the poor things must do something, they can’t
starve while there’s anything to be got. Why,
no later than six or seven years ago, it was as
high as 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 4<i>s.</i> a pail-full, and a ready sale
for as much of it as you could get; but now you
can only get 1<i>s.</i> and in some places 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a
pail-full; and, as I said before, there are so many
at it, that there is not much left for a poor old
creature like me to find. The men that are strong
and smart get the most, of course, and some of
them do very well, at least they manage to live.
Six years ago, my husband complained that he
was ill, in the evening, and lay down in the bed&mdash;we
lived in Whitechapel then&mdash;he took a fit of
coughing, and was smothered in his own blood.
O dear” (the poor old soul here ejaculated), “what
troubles I have gone through! I had eight children
at one time, and there is not one of them
alive now. My daughter lived to 30 years of
age, and then she died in childbirth, and, since
then, I have had nobody in the wide world to
care for me&mdash;none but myself, all alone as I am.
After my husband’s death I couldn’t do much,
and all my things went away, one by one, until
I’ve nothing but bare walls, and that’s the
reason why I was vexed at first at your coming in,
sir. I was yesterday out all day, and went round
Aldgate, Whitechapel, St. George’s East, Stepney,
Bow, and Bromley, and then came home; after
that, I went over to Bermondsey, and there I got
only 6<i>d.</i> for my pains. To-day I wasn’t out at
all; I wasn’t well; I had a bad headache, and
I’m so much afraid of the fevers that are all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
here&mdash;though I don’t know why I should be
afraid of them&mdash;I was lying down, when you
came, to get rid of my pains. There’s such a dizziness
in my head now, I feel as if it didn’t belong
to me. No, I have earned no money to-day. I
have had a piece of dried bread that I steeped in
water to eat. I haven’t eat anything else to-day;
but, pray, sir, don’t tell anybody of it. I could
never bear the thought of going into the ‘great
house’ [workhouse]; I’m so used to the air, that
I’d sooner die in the street, as many I know have
done. I’ve known several of our people, who
have sat down in the street with their basket
alongside them, and died. I knew one not long
ago, who took ill just as she was stooping down
to gather up the Pure, and fell on her face; she
was taken to the London Hospital, and died at
three o’clock in the morning. I’d sooner die like
them than be deprived of my liberty, and be prevented
from going about where I liked. No, I’ll
never go into the workhouse; my master is kind
to me” [the tanner whom she supplies]. “When
I’m ill, he sometimes gives me a sixpence; but
there’s one gentleman has done us great harm, by
forcing so many into the business. He’s a poor-law
guardian, and when any poor person applies
for relief, he tells them to go and gather Pure,
and that he’ll buy it of them (for he’s in the
line), and so the parish, you see, don’t have to
give anything, and that’s one way that so many
have come into the trade of late, that the likes of
me can do little or no good at it. Almost every
one I’ve ever known engaged at Pure-finding were
people who were better off once. I knew a man
who went by the name of Brown, who picked up
Pure for years before I went to it; he was a very
quiet man; he used to lodge in Blue Anchor-yard,
and seldom used to speak to anybody. We two
used to talk together sometimes, but never much.
One morning he was found dead in his bed; it
was of a Tuesday morning, and he was buried
about 12 o’clock on the Friday following. About
6 o’clock on that afternoon, three or four gentlemen
came searching all through this place, looking
for a man named Brown, and offering a reward to
any who would find him out; there was a whole
crowd about them when I came up. One of the
gentlemen said that the man they wanted had lost
the first finger of his right hand, and then I knew
that it was the man that had been buried only
that morning. Would you believe it, Mr. Brown
was a real gentleman all the time, and had
a large estate, of I don’t know how many thousand
pounds, just left him, and the lawyers had advertised
and searched everywhere for him, but never
found him, you may say, till he was dead. We
discovered that his name was not Brown; he had
only taken that name to hide his real one, which,
of course, he did not want any one to know. I’ve
often thought of him, poor man, and all the misery
he might have been spared, if the good news had
only come a year or two sooner.”</p>

<p>Another informant, a Pure-collector, was originally
in the Manchester cotton trade, and held
a lucrative situation in a large country establishment.
His salary one year exceeded 250<i>l.</i>, and
his regular income was 150<i>l.</i> “This,” he says,
“I lost through drink and neglect. My master
was exceedingly kind to me, and has even assisted
me since I left his employ. He bore with me
patiently for many years, but the love of drink
was so strong upon me that it was impossible for
him to keep me any longer.” He has often been
drunk, he tells me, for three months together;
and he is now so reduced that he is ashamed to
be seen. When at his master’s it was his duty
to carve and help the other assistants belonging
to the establishment, and his hand used to shake
so violently that he has been ashamed to lift the
gravy spoon.</p>

<p>At breakfast he has frequently waited till all
the young men had left the table before he ventured
to taste his tea; and immediately, when he
was alone, he has bent his head down to his cup
to drink, being utterly incapable of raising it to
his lips. He says he is a living example of the
degrading influence of drink. All his friends
have deserted him. He has suffered enough, he
tells me, to make him give it up. He earned the
week before I saw him 5<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; and the week
before that, 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Before leaving me I prevailed upon the man to
“take the pledge.” This is now eighteen months
ago, and I have not seen him since.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cigar-end Finders.</span></h3>

<p>There are, strictly speaking, none who make a
living by picking up the ends of cigars thrown
away as useless by the smokers in the streets,
but there are very many who employ themselves
from time to time in collecting them. Almost all the
street-finders, when they meet with such things,
pick them up, and keep them in a pocket set
apart for that purpose. The men allow the ends
to accumulate till they amount to two or three
pounds weight, and then some dispose of them to a
person residing in the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane,
who buys them all up at from 6<i>d.</i> to
10<i>d.</i> per pound, according to their length and
quality. The long ends are considered the best,
as I am told there is more sound tobacco in them,
uninjured by the moisture of the mouth. The
children of the poor Irish, in particular, scour
Ratcliff-highway, the Commercial-road, Mile-end-road,
and all the leading thoroughfares of the
East, and every place where cigar smokers are
likely to take an evening’s promenade. The
quantity that each of them collects is very trifling
indeed&mdash;perhaps not more than a handful during
a morning’s search. I am informed, by an intelligent
man living in the midst of them, that these
children go out in the morning not only to gather
cigar-ends, but to pick up out of dust bins, and
from amongst rubbish in the streets, the smallest
scraps and crusts of bread, no matter how hard
or filthy they may be. These they put into a
little bag which they carry for the purpose, and,
after they have gone their rounds and collected whatever
they can, they take the cigar-ends to the man
who buys them&mdash;sometimes getting not more than
a halfpenny or a penny for their morning’s collection.
With this they buy a halfpenny or a pennyworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of oatmeal, which they mix up with a large
quantity of water, and after washing and steeping
the hard and dirty crusts, they put them into the
pot or kettle and boil all together. Of this mass
the whole family partake, and it often constitutes
all the food they taste in the course of the day.
I have often seen the bone-grubbers eat the black
and soddened crusts they have picked up out of
the gutter.</p>

<p>It would, indeed, be a hopeless task to make
any attempt to get at the number of persons who
occasionally or otherwise pick up cigar-ends with
the view of selling them again. For this purpose
almost all who ransack the streets of London for a
living may be computed as belonging to the class;
and to these should be added the children of the
thousands of destitute Irish who have inundated
the metropolis within the last few years, and who
are to be found huddled together in all the low
neighbourhoods in every suburb of the City.
What quantity is collected, or the amount of
money obtained for the ends, there are no means
of ascertaining.</p>

<p>Let us, however, make a conjecture. There are
in round numbers 300,000 inhabited houses in the
metropolis; and allowing the married people living
in apartments to be equal in number to the unmarried
“housekeepers,” we may compute that the
number of families in London is about the same
as the inhabited houses. Assuming one young or
old gentleman in every ten of these families to
smoke one cigar per diem in the public thoroughfares,
we have 30,000 cigar-ends daily, or 210,000
weekly cast away in the London streets. Now,
reckoning 150 cigars to go to a pound, we may
assume that each end so cast away weighs about
the thousandth part of a pound; consequently
the gross weight of the ends flung into the gutter
will, in the course of the week, amount to about
2 cwt.; and calculating that only a sixth part of
these are picked up by the finders, it follows
that there is very nearly a ton of refuse tobacco
collected annually in the metropolitan thoroughfares.</p>

<p>The aristocratic quarters of the City and the
vicinity of theatres and casinos are the best for
the cigar-end finders. In the Strand, Regent-street,
and the more fashionable thoroughfares,
I am told, there are many ends picked up; but
even in these places they do not exclusively
furnish a means of living to any of the finders.
All the collectors sell them to some other person,
who acts as middle-man in the business. How
he disposes of the ends is unknown, but it is
supposed that they are resold to some of the
large manufacturers of cigars, and go to form the
component part of a new stock of the “best
Havannahs;” or, in other words, they are worked
up again to be again cast away, and again collected
by the finders, and so on perhaps, till the millennium
comes. Some suppose them to be cut up and
mixed with the common smoking tobacco, and
others that they are used in making snuff. There
are, I am assured, five persons residing in different
parts of London, who are known to purchase the
cigar-ends.</p>

<p>In Naples the sale of cigar-ends is a regular
street-traffic, the street-seller carrying them in a
small box suspended round the neck. In Paris,
also, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Remasseur de Cigares</i> is a well-known
occupation: the “ends” thus collected are sold as
cheap tobacco to the poor. In the low lodging-houses
of London the ends, when dried, are cut
up, and frequently vended by the finders to such
of their fellow-lodgers as are anxious to enjoy
their pipe at the cheapest possible rate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Old Wood Gatherers.</span></h3>

<p>All that has been said of the cigar-end finders
may, in a great measure, apply to the wood-gatherers.
No one can make a living exclusively
by the gathering of wood, and those who <i>do</i> gather
it, gather as well rags, bones, and bits of metal.
They gather it, indeed, as an adjunct to their
other findings, on the principle that “every little
helps.” Those, however, who most frequently look
for wood are the very old and feeble, and the very
young, who are both unable to travel far, or to
carry a heavy burden, and they may occasionally
be seen crawling about in the neighbourhood of
any new buildings in the course of construction, or
old ones in the course of demolition, and picking up
small odds and ends of wood and chips swept out
amongst dirt and shavings; these they deposit in a
bag or basket which they carry for that purpose.
Should there happen to be what they call “pulling-down
work,” that is, taking down old houses,
or palings, the place is immediately beset by a
number of wood-gatherers, young and old, and
in general all the poor people of the locality join
with them, to obtain their share of the spoil.
What the poor get they take home and burn, but
the wood-gatherers sell all they procure for some
small trifle.</p>

<p>Some short time ago a portion of the wood-pavement
in the city was being removed; a large number
of the old blocks, which were much worn and
of no further use, were thrown aside, and became
the perquisite of the wood-gatherers. During the
repair of the street, the spot was constantly besieged
by a motley mob of men, women, and children,
who, in many instances, struggled and fought
for the wood rejected as worthless. This wood
they either sold for a trifle as they got it, or took
home and split, and made into bundles for sale
as firewood.</p>

<p>All the mudlarks (of whom I shall treat
specially) pick up wood and chips on the bank of
the river; these they sell to poor people in their
own neighbourhood. They sometimes “find”
large pieces of a greater weight than they can
carry; in such cases they get some other mudlark
to help them with the load, and the two
“go halves” in the produce. The only parties
among the street-finders who do not pick up wood
are the Pure-collectors and the sewer-hunters, or,
as they call themselves, shore-workers, both of
whom pass it by as of no value.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate the quantity of
wood which is thus gathered, or what the amount
may be which the collector realises in the course
of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Dredgers, or River Finders.</span></h3>

<p>The dredgermen of the Thames, or river finders,
naturally occupy the same place with reference
to the street-finders, as the purlmen or river beer-sellers
do to those who get their living by selling
in the streets. It would be in itself a curious
inquiry to trace the origin of the manifold occupations
in which men are found to be engaged in
the present day, and to note how promptly every
circumstance and occurrence was laid hold of, as it
happened to arise, which appeared to have any
tendency to open up a new occupation, and to
mark the gradual progress, till it became a regularly-established
employment, followed by a
separate class of people, fenced round by rules
and customs of their own, and who at length grew
to be both in their habits and peculiarities plainly
distinct from the other classes among whom they
chanced to be located.</p>

<p>There has been no historian among the dredgers
of the Thames to record the commencement of the
business, and the utmost that any of the river-finders
can tell is that his father had been a
dredger, and so had his father before him, and that
<i>that’s</i> the reason why they are dredgers also. But
no such people as dredgers were known on the
Thames in remote days; and before London had become
an important trading port, where nothing was
likely to be got for the searching, it is not probable
that people would have been induced to search. In
those days, the only things searched for in the river
were the bodies of persons drowned, accidentally
or otherwise. For this purpose, the Thames
fishermen of all others, appeared to be the best
adapted. They were on the spot at all times, and
had various sorts of tackle, such as nets, lines,
hooks, &amp;c. The fishermen well understood everything
connected with the river, such as the various
sets of the tide, and the nature of the bottom, and
they were therefore on such occasions invariably
applied to for these purposes.</p>

<p>It is known to all who remember anything of
Old London Bridge, that at certain times of the
tide, in consequence of the velocity with which
the water rushed through the narrow apertures
which the arches then afforded for its passage,
to bring a boat in safety through the bridge
was a feat to be attempted only by the skilful and
experienced. This feat was known as “shooting”
London Bridge; and it was no unusual
thing for accidents to happen even to the most
expert. In fact, numerous accidents occurred at
this bridge, and at such times valuable articles
were sometimes lost, for which high rewards were
offered to the finder. Here again the fishermen
came into requisition, the small drag-net, which
they used while rowing, offering itself for the
purpose; for, by fixing an iron frame round the
mouth of the drag-net, this part of it, from its
specific gravity, sunk first to the bottom, and consequently
scraped along as they pulled forward,
collecting into the net everything that came in its
way; when it was nearly filled, which the rower
always knew by the weight, it was hauled up to
the surface, its contents examined, and the object
lost generally recovered.</p>

<p>It is thus apparent that the fishermen of the
Thames were the men originally employed as
dredgermen; though casually, indeed, at first,
and according as circumstances occurred requiring
their services. By degrees, however, as the commerce
of the river increased, and a greater number
of articles fell overboard from the shipping, they
came to be more frequently called into requisition,
and so they were naturally led to adopt the
dredging as part and parcel of their business.
Thus it remains to the present day.</p>

<p>The fishermen all serve a regular apprenticeship,
as they say themselves, “duly and truly”
for seven years. During the time of their apprenticeship
they are (or rather, in former times
they <i>were</i>) obliged to sleep in their master’s boat
at night to take care of his property, and were
subject to many other curious regulations, which
are foreign to this subject.</p>

<p>I have said that the fishermen of the Thames
to the present day unite the dredging to their
proper calling. By this I mean that they employ
themselves in fishing during the summer and
autumn, either from Barking Creek downwards,
or from Chelsea Reach upwards, catching dabs,
flounders, eels, and other sorts of fish for the
London markets. But in winter when the days
are short and cold, and the weather stormy, they
prefer stopping at home, and dredging the bed of
the river for anything they may chance to find.
There are others, however, who have started
wholly in the dredging line, there being no hindrance
or impediment to any one doing so, nor any
licence required for the purpose: these dredge the
river winter and summer alike, and are, in fact,
the only real dredgermen of the present day
living solely by that occupation.</p>

<p>There are in all about 100 dredgermen at work
on the river, and these are located as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="left">And from Deptford to Gravesend</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="total">100</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>All these reside, in general, on the south
side of the Thames, the two places most frequented
by them being Lambeth and Rotherhithe.
They do not, however, confine themselves
to the neighbourhoods wherein they reside, but
extend their operations to all parts of the river,
where it is likely that they may pick up anything;
and it is perfectly marvellous with what
rapidity the intelligence of any accident calculated
to afford them employment is spread among them;
for should a loaded coal barge be sunk over night,
by daylight the next morning every dredgerman
would be sure to be upon the spot, prepared to
collect what he could from the wreck at the
bottom of the river.</p>

<p>The boats of the dredgermen are of a peculiar
shape. They have no stern, but are the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
fore and aft. They are called Peter boats, but
not one of the men with whom I spoke had the
least idea as to the origin of the name. These boats
are to be had at almost all prices, according to their
condition and age&mdash;from 30<i>s.</i> to 20<i>l.</i> The boats
used by the fishermen dredgermen are decidedly
the most valuable. One with the other, perhaps
the whole may average 10<i>l.</i> each; and this sum
will give 1000<i>l.</i> as the value of the entire number.
A complete set of tackle, including drags, will
cost 2<i>l.</i>, which comes to 200<i>l.</i> for all hands; and
thus we have the sum of 1200<i>l.</i> as the amount
of capital invested in the dredging of the Thames.</p>

<p>It is by no means an easy matter to form any
estimate of the earnings of the dredgermen, as they
are a matter of mere chance. In former years,
when Indiamen and all the foreign shipping lay
in the river, the river finders were in the habit of
doing a good business, not only in their own line,
through the greater quantities of rope, bones, and
other things which then were thrown or fell overboard,
but they also contrived to smuggle ashore
great quantities of tobacco, tea, spirits, and other
contraband articles, and thought it a bad day’s
work when they did not earn a pound independent
of their dredging. An old dredger told
me he had often in those days made 5<i>l.</i> before
breakfast time. After the excavation of the various
docks, and after the larger shipping had
departed from the river, the finders were obliged
to content themselves with the chances of mere
dredging; and even then, I am informed, they
were in the habit of earning one week with
another throughout the year, about 25<i>s.</i> per week,
each, or 6500<i>l.</i> per annum among all. Latterly,
however, the earnings of these men have greatly
fallen off, especially in the summer, for then they
cannot get so good a price for the coal they find
as in the winter&mdash;6<i>d.</i> per bushel being the summer
price; and, as they consider three bushels a
good day’s work, their earnings at this period of
the year amount only to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day, excepting
when they happen to pick up some bones or
pieces of metal, or to find a dead body for which
there is a reward. In the winter, however, the
dredgermen can readily get 1<i>s.</i> per bushel for all
the coals they find; and far more coals are to be
found then than in summer, for there are more
colliers in the river, and far more accidents at
that season. Coal barges are often sunk in the
winter, and on such occasions they make a good
harvest. Moreover there is the finding of bodies,
for which they not only get the reward, but 5<i>s.</i>,
which they call inquest money; together with
many other chances, such as the finding of money
and valuables among the rubbish they bring up
from the bottom; but as the last-mentioned are
accidents happening throughout the year, I am
inclined to think that they have understated the
amount which they are in the habit of realizing
even in the summer.</p>

<p>The dredgers, as a class, may be said to be
altogether uneducated, not half a dozen out of
the whole number being able to read their own
name, and only one or two to write it; this select
few are considered by the rest as perfect
prodigies. “Lor’ bless you!” said one, “I on’y
wish you’d ’ear Bill <span class="lock">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> read; I on’y jist wish
you’d ’ear him. Why that ere Bill can read
faster nor a dog can trot. And, what’s more, I
seed him write an ole letter hisself, ev’ry word on
it! What do you think o’ that now?” The ignorance
of the dredgermen may be accounted for
by the men taking so early to the water; the
bustle and excitement of the river being far more
attractive to them than the routine of a school.
Almost as soon as they are able to do anything,
the dredgermen’s boys are taken by their fathers
afloat to assist in picking out the coals, bones,
and other things of any use, from the midst of
the rubbish brought up in their drag-nets; or else
the lads are sent on board as assistants to one or
other of the fishermen during their fishing voyages.
When once engaged in this way it has been
found impossible afterwards to keep the youths from
the water; and if they have learned anything
previously they very soon forget it.</p>

<p>It might be expected that the dredgers, in a
manner depending on chance for their livelihood,
and leading a restless sort of life on the water,
would closely resemble the costermongers in their
habits; but it is far otherwise. There can be no two
classes more dissimilar, except in their hatred of
restraint. The dredgers are sober and steady;
gambling is unknown amongst them; and they
are, to an extraordinary degree, laborious, persevering,
and patient. They are in general men of
short stature, but square built, strong, and capable
of enduring great fatigue, and have a silent and
thoughtful look. Being almost always alone, and
studying how they may best succeed in finding
what they seek, marking the various sets of the
tide, and the direction in which things falling
into the water at a particular place must necessarily
be carried, they become the very opposite
to the other river people, especially to the watermen,
who are brawling and clamorous, and delight
in continually “chaffing” each other. In
consequence of the sober and industrious habits
of the dredgermen their homes are, as they say,
“pretty fair” for working men, though there is
nothing very luxurious to be found in them, nor
indeed anything beyond what is absolutely necessary.
After their day’s work, especially if
they have “done well,” these men smoke a pipe
over a pint or two of beer at the nearest public-house,
get home early to bed, and if the tide
answers may be found on the river patiently
dredging away at two or three o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>Whenever a loaded coal barge happens to sink,
as I have already intimated, it is surprising how
short a time elapses before that part of the river
is alive with the dredgers. They flock thither
from all parts. The river on such occasions presents
a very animated appearance. At first they
are all in a group, and apparently in confusion,
crossing and re-crossing each other’s course; some
with their oars pulled in while they examine the
contents of their nets, and empty the coals into
the bottom of their boats; others rowing and
tugging against the stream, to obtain an advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>tageous
position for the next cast; and when
they consider they have found this, down go the
dredging-nets to the bottom, and away they row
again with the stream, as if pulling for a wager,
till they find by the weight of their net that it is
full; then they at once stop, haul it to the surface,
and commence another course. Others who
have been successful in getting their boats loaded
may be seen pushing away from the main body,
and making towards the shore. Here they busily
employ themselves, with what help they can get,
in emptying the boat of her cargo&mdash;carrying it
ashore in old coal baskets, bushel measures, or anything
else which will suit their purpose; and when
this is completed they pull out again to join their
comrades, and commence afresh. They continue
working thus till the returning tide puts an end
to their labours, but these are resumed after the
tide has fallen to a certain depth; and so they go
on, working night and day while there is anything
to be got.</p>

<p>The dredgerman and his boat may be immediately
distinguished from all others; there is
nothing similar to them on the river. The sharp
cutwater fore and aft, and short rounded appearance
of the vessel, marks it out at once from the
skiff or wherry of the waterman. There is, too,
always the appearance of labour about the boat,
like a ship returning after a long voyage, daubed
and filthy, and looking sadly in need of a thorough
cleansing. The grappling irons are over
the bow, resting on a coil of rope; while the other
end of the boat is filled with coals, bones, and
old rope, mixed with the mud of the river. The
ropes of the dredging-net hang over the side. A
short stout figure, with a face soiled and blackened
with perspiration, and surmounted by a tarred
sou’-wester, the body habited in a soiled check
shirt, with the sleeves turned up above the elbows,
and exhibiting a pair of sunburnt brawny arms, is
pulling at the sculls, not with the ease and lightness
of the waterman, but toiling and tugging
away like a galley slave, as he scours the bed of
the river with his dredging-net in search of some
hoped-for prize.</p>

<p>The dredgers, as was before stated, are the men
who find almost all the bodies of persons drowned.
If there be a reward offered for the recovery of a
body, numbers of the dredgers will at once endeavour
to obtain it, while if there be no reward,
there is at least the inquest money to be had&mdash;beside
other chances. What these chances are
may be inferred from the well-known fact, that
no body recovered by a dredgerman ever happens
to have any money about it, when brought to
shore. There may, indeed, be a watch in the fob
or waistcoat pocket, for that article would be likely
to be traced. There may, too, be a purse or
pocket-book forthcoming, but somehow it is invariably
empty. The dredgers cannot by any
reasoning or argument be made to comprehend that
there is anything like dishonesty in emptying the
pockets of a dead man. They consider them as their
just perquisites. They say that any one who
finds a body does precisely the same, and that if
they did not do so the police would. After having
had all the trouble and labour, they allege that
they have a much better right to whatever is to
be got, than the police who have had nothing whatever
to do with it. There are also people who
shrewdly suspect that some of the coals from the
barges lying in the river, very often find their way
into the dredgers’ boats, especially when the
dredgers are engaged in night-work; and there
are even some who do not hold them guiltless of,
now and then, when opportunity offers, smuggling
things ashore from many of the steamers coming
from foreign parts. But such things, I repeat,
the dredgers consider in the fair way of their
business.</p>

<p>One of the most industrious, and I believe one
of the most skilful and successful of this peculiar
class, gave me the following epitome of his history.</p>

<p>“Father was a dredger, and grandfather afore
him; grandfather was a dredger and a fisherman
too. A’most as soon as I was able to crawl, father
took me with him in the boat to help him to pick
the coals, and bones, and other things out of the
net, and to use me to the water. When I got bigger
and stronger, I was sent to the parish school, but
I didn’t like it half as well as the boat, and
couldn’t be got to stay two days together. At last
I went above bridge, and went along with a fisherman,
and used to sleep in the boat every night.
I liked to sleep in the boat; I used to be as comfortable
as could be. Lor bless you! there’s a tilt
to them boats, and no rain can’t git at you. I used
to lie awake of a night in them times, and listen
to the water shipping ag’in the boat, and think it
fine fun. I might a got bound ’prentice, but I got
aboard a smack, where I stayed three or four
year, and if I’d a stayed there, I’d a liked it
much better. But I heerd as how father was ill,
so I com’d home, and took to the dredging, and
am at it off and on ever since. I got no larnin’,
how could I? There’s on’y one or two of us
dredgers as knows anything of larnin’, and they’re
no better off than the rest. Larnin’s no use to a
dredger, he hasn’t got no time to read; and if he
had, why it wouldn’t tell him where the holes and
furrows is at the bottom of the river, and where
things is to be found. To be sure there’s holes
and furrows at the bottom. I know a good many.
I know a furrow off Lime’us Point, no wider
nor the dredge, and I can go there, and when
others can’t git anything but stones and mud, I
can git four or five bushel o’ coal. You see they lay
there; they get in with the set of the tide, and
can’t git out so easy like. Dredgers don’t do so
well now as they used to do. You know Pelican
Stairs? well, before the Docks was built, when
the ships lay there, I could go under Pelican Pier
and pick up four or five shilling of a morning.
What was that tho’ to father? I hear him say he
often made 5<i>l.</i> afore breakfast, and nobody ever
the wiser. Them were fine times! there was a
good livin’ to be picked up on the water them
days. About ten year ago, the fishermen at
Lambeth, them as sarves their time ‘duly and
truly’ thought to put us off the water, and went
afore the Lord Mayor, but they couldn’t do nothink
after all. They do better nor us, as they go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
fishin’ all the summer, when the dredgin’ is bad,
and come back in winter. Some on us down
here” [Rotherhithe] “go a deal-portering in the
summer, or unloading ’tatoes, or anything else
we can get; when we have nothin’ else to
do, we go on the river. Father don’t dredge
now, he’s too old for that; it takes a man to be
strong to dredge, so father goes to ship scrapin’.
He on’y sits on a plank outside the ship, and
scrapes off the old tar with a scraper. We does very
well for all that&mdash;why he can make his half a bull
a day [2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>] when he gits work, but that’s not
always; howsomever I helps the old man at
times, when I’m able. I’ve found a good many
bodies. I got a many rewards, and a tidy bit
of inquest money. There’s 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> inquest money
at Rotherhithe, and on’y a shillin’ at Deptford; I
can’t make out how that is, but that’s all they
give, I know. I never finds anythink on the bodies.
Lor bless you! people don’t have anythink in their
pockets when they gits drowned, they are not
such fools as all that. Do you see them two marks
there on the back of my hand? Well, one day&mdash;I
was on’y young then&mdash;I was grabblin’ for old rope
in Church Hole, when I brings up a body, and
just as I was fixing the rope on his leg to tow him
ashore, two swells comes down in a skiff, and lays
hold of the painter of my boat, and tows me
ashore. The hook of the drag went right thro’
the trowsers of the drowned man and my hand,
and I couldn’t let go no how, and tho’ I roared
out like mad, the swells didn’t care, but dragged
me into the stairs. When I got there, my arm,
and the corpse’s shoe and trowsers, was all kivered
with my blood. What do you think the gents
said?&mdash;why, they told me as how they had done
me good, in towin’ the body in, and ran away up
the stairs. Tho’ times ain’t near so good as they
was, I manages purty tidy, and hasn’t got no
occasion to hollor much; but there’s some of the
dredgers as would hollor, if they was ever so well
off.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sewer-Hunters.</span></h3>

<p>Some few years ago, the main sewers, having their
outlets on the river side, were completely open,
so that any person desirous of exploring their
dark and uninviting recesses might enter at the
river side, and wander away, provided he could
withstand the combination of villanous stenches
which met him at every step, for many miles,
in any direction. At that time it was a thing of
very frequent occurrence, especially at the spring
tides, for the water to rush into the sewers,
pouring through them like a torrent, and then
to burst up through the gratings into the
streets, flooding all the low-lying districts in the
vicinity of the river, till the streets of Shadwell
and Wapping resembled a Dutch town, intersected
by a series of muddy canals. Of late,
however, to remedy this defect, the Commissioners
have had a strong brick wall built within
the entrance to the several sewers. In each of
these brick walls there is an opening covered by a
strong iron door, which hangs from the top and
is so arranged that when the tide is low the rush
of the water and other filth on the inner side,
forces it back and allows the contents of the sewer
to pass into the river, whilst when the tide rises
the door is forced so close against the wall by
the pressure of the water outside that none can
by any possibility enter, and thus the river
neighbourhoods are secured from the deluges which
were heretofore of such frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Were it not a notorious fact, it might perhaps
be thought impossible, that men could be found
who, for the chance of obtaining a living of some
sort or other, would, day after day, and year after
year, continue to travel through these underground
channels for the offscouring of the city; but such
is the case even at the present moment. In
former times, however, this custom prevailed much
more than now, for in those days the sewers
were entirely open and presented no obstacle to
any one desirous of entering them. Many wondrous
tales are still told among the people of men
having lost their way in the sewers, and of having
wandered among the filthy passages&mdash;their
lights extinguished by the noisome vapours&mdash;till,
faint and overpowered, they dropped down and
died on the spot. Other stories are told of sewer-hunters
beset by myriads of enormous rats, and
slaying thousands of them in their struggle for
life, till at length the swarms of the savage things
overpowered them, and in a few days afterwards
their skeletons were discovered picked to the very
bones. Since the iron doors, however, have been
placed on the main sewers a prohibition has been
issued against entering them, and a reward of 5<i>l.</i>
offered to any person giving information so as to
lead to the conviction of any offender. Nevertheless
many still travel through these foul labyrinths,
in search of such valuables as may have
found their way down the drains.</p>

<p>The persons who are in the habit of searching
the sewers, call themselves “shore-men” or “shore-workers.”
They belong, in a certain degree, to the
same class as the “mud-larks,” that is to say, they
travel through the mud along shore in the neighbourhood
of ship-building and ship-breaking yards,
for the purpose of picking up copper nails, bolts,
iron, and old rope. The shore-men, however,
do not collect the lumps of coal and wood they
meet with on their way, but leave them as the
proper perquisites of the mud-larks. The sewer-hunters
were formerly, and indeed are still, called
by the name of “Toshers,” the articles which they
pick up in the course of their wanderings along
shore being known among themselves by the
general term “tosh,” a word more particularly
applied by them to anything made of copper.
These “Toshers” may be seen, especially on the
Surrey side of the Thames, habited in long greasy
velveteen coats, furnished with pockets of vast capacity,
and their nether limbs encased in dirty canvas
trowsers, and any old slops of shoes, that may be
fit only for wading through the mud. They carry
a bag on their back, and in their hand a pole seven
or eight feet long, on one end of which there is
a large iron hoe. The uses of this instrument are
various; with it they try the ground wherever it
appears unsafe, before venturing on it, and, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
assured of its safety, walk forward steadying their
footsteps with the staff. Should they, as often
happens, even to the most experienced, sink in
some quagmire, they immediately throw out the
long pole armed with the hoe, which is always
held uppermost for this purpose, and with it seizing
hold of any object within their reach, are thereby
enabled to draw themselves out; without
the pole, however, their danger would be
greater, for the more they struggled to extricate
themselves from such places, the deeper they
would sink; and even with it, they might perish,
I am told, in some part, if there were nobody at
hand to render them assistance. Finally, they
make use of this pole to rake about the mud
when searching for iron, copper, rope, and bones.
They mostly exhibit great skill in discovering
these things in unlikely places, and have a knowledge
of the various sets of the tide, calculated to
carry articles to particular points, almost equal to
the dredgermen themselves. Although they cannot
“pick up” as much now as they formerly
did, they are still able to make what they call a
fair living, and can afford to look down with a
species of aristocratic contempt on the puny efforts
of their less fortunate brethren the “mudlarks.”</p>

<p>To enter the sewers and explore them to any
considerable distance is considered, even by those
acquainted with what is termed “working the
shores,” an adventure of no small risk. There are
a variety of perils to be encountered in such
places. The brick-work in many parts&mdash;especially
in the old sewers&mdash;has become rotten through the
continual action of the putrefying matter and
moisture, and parts have fallen down and choked
up the passage with heaps of rubbish; over these
obstructions, nevertheless, the sewer-hunters have
to scramble “in the best way they can.” In
such parts they are careful not to touch the brick-work
over head, for the slightest tap might
bring down an avalanche of old bricks and
earth, and severely injure them, if not bury them
in the rubbish. Since the construction of the
new sewers, the old ones are in general abandoned
by the “hunters;” but in many places the
former channels cross and re-cross those recently constructed,
and in the old sewers a person is very likely
to lose his way. It is dangerous to venture far into
any of the smaller sewers branching off from the
main, for in this the “hunters” have to stoop low
down in order to proceed; and, from the confined
space, there are often accumulated in such places,
large quantities of foul air, which, as one of them
stated, will “cause instantious death.” Moreover,
far from there being any romance in the tales told
of the rats, these vermin are really numerous and
formidable in the sewers, and have been known,
I am assured, to attack men when alone, and
even sometimes when accompanied by others,
with such fury that the people have escaped from
them with difficulty. They are particularly
ferocious and dangerous, if they be driven into
some corner whence they cannot escape, when
they will immediately fly at any one that opposes
their progress. I received a similar account to
this from one of the London flushermen. There
are moreover, in some quarters, ditches or trenches
which are filled as the water rushes up the sewers
with the tide; in these ditches the water is retained
by a sluice, which is shut down at high
tide, and lifted again at low tide, when it rushes
down the sewers with all the violence of a
mountain torrent, sweeping everything before it.
If the sewer-hunter be not close to some branch
sewer, so that he can run into it, whenever the
opening of these sluices takes place, he must inevitably
perish. The trenches or water reservoirs
for the cleansing of the sewers are chiefly on
the south side of the river, and, as a proof of the
great danger to which the sewer-hunters are exposed
in such cases, it may be stated, that not
very long ago, a sewer on the south side of the
Thames was opened to be repaired; a long ladder
reached to the bottom of the sewer, down which
the bricklayer’s labourer was going with a hod of
bricks, when the rush of water from the sluice,
struck the bottom of the ladder, and instantly
swept away ladder, labourer, and all. The bricklayer
fortunately was enjoying his “pint and pipe”
at a neighbouring public-house. The labourer was
found by my informant, a “shore-worker,” near
the mouth of the sewer quite dead, battered, and
disfigured in a frightful manner. There was likewise
great danger in former times from the rising
of the tide in the sewers, so that it was necessary
for the shore-men to have quitted them before the
water had got any height within the entrance.
At present, however, this is obviated in those
sewers where the main is furnished with an iron
door towards the river.</p>

<p>The shore-workers, when about to enter the
sewers, provide themselves, in addition to the long
hoe already described, with a canvas apron, which
they tie round them, and a dark lantern similar to
a policeman’s; this they strap before them on their
right breast, in such a manner that on removing the
shade, the bull’s-eye throws the light straight forward
when they are in an erect position, and enables
them to see everything in advance of them for
some distance; but when they stoop, it throws the
light directly under them, so that they can then
distinctly see any object at their feet. The
sewer-hunters usually go in gangs of three or four
for the sake of company, and in order that they
may be the better able to defend themselves from
the rats. The old hands who have been often up
(and every gang endeavours to include at least one
experienced person), travel a long distance, not
only through the main sewers, but also through
many of the branches. Whenever the shore-men
come near a street grating, they close their lanterns
and watch their opportunity of gliding silently
past unobserved, for otherwise a crowd might
collect over head and intimate to the policeman on
duty, that there were persons wandering in the
sewers below. The shore-workers never take
dogs with them, lest their barking when hunting
the rats might excite attention. As the men go
along they search the bottom of the sewer, raking
away the mud with their hoe, and pick, from between
the crevices of the brick-work, money, or
anything else that may have lodged there. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
are in many parts of the sewers holes where the
brick-work has been worn away, and in these holes
clusters of articles are found, which have been
washed into them from time to time, and perhaps
been collecting there for years; such as pieces of
iron, nails, various scraps of metal, coins of every
description, all rusted into a mass like a rock, and
weighing from a half hundred to two hundred
weight altogether. These “conglomerates” of
metal are too heavy for the men to take out of the
sewers, so that if unable to break them up, they
are compelled to leave them behind; and there
are very many such masses, I am informed, lying in
the sewers at this moment, of immense weight, and
growing larger every day by continual additions.
The shore-men find great quantities of money&mdash;of
copper money especially; sometimes they dive
their arm down to the elbow in the mud and
filth and bring up shillings, sixpences, half-crowns,
and occasionally half-sovereigns and sovereigns.
They always find the coins standing edge uppermost
between the bricks in the bottom, where the
mortar has been worn away. The sewer-hunters
occasionally find plate, such as spoons, ladles, silver-handled
knives and forks, mugs and drinking
cups, and now and then articles of jewellery; but
even while thus “in luck” as they call it, they do
not omit to fill the bags on their backs with the
more cumbrous articles they meet with&mdash;such as
metals of every description, rope and bones. There
is always a great quantity of these things to be
met with in the sewers, they being continually
washed down from the cesspools and drains of the
houses. When the sewer-hunters consider they
have searched long enough, or when they have
found as much as they can conveniently take
away, the gang leave the sewers and, adjourning to
the nearest of their homes, count out the money
they have picked up, and proceed to dispose of the
old metal, bones, rope, &amp;c.; this done, they then, as
they term it, “whack” the whole lot; that is,
they divide it equally among all hands. At these
divisions, I am assured, it frequently occurs that
each member of the gang will realise from 30<i>s.</i> to
2<i>l.</i>&mdash;this at least <i>was</i> a frequent occurrence some
few years ago. Of late, however, the shore-men are
obliged to use far more caution, as the police, and
especially those connected with the river, who are
more on the alert, as well as many of the coal-merchants
in the neighbourhood of the sewers,
would give information if they saw any suspicious
persons approaching them.</p>

<p>The principal localities in which the shore-hunters
reside are in Mint-square, Mint-street,
and Kent-street, in the Borough&mdash;Snow’s-fields,
Bermondsey&mdash;and that never-failing locality between
the London Docks and Rosemary-lane
which appears to be a concentration of all the
misery of the kingdom. There were known to
be a few years ago nearly 200 sewer-hunters,
or “toshers,” and, incredible as it may appear, I
have satisfied myself that, taking one week with
another, they could not be said to make much
short of 2<i>l.</i> per week. Their probable gains, I
was told, were about 6<i>s.</i> per day all the year
round. At this rate the property recovered from
the sewers of London would have amounted to
no less than 20,000<i>l.</i> per annum, which would
make the amount of property lost down the drains
of each house amount to 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year. The
shore-hunters of the present day greatly complain
of the recent restrictions, and inveigh
in no measured terms against the constituted
authorities. “They won’t let us in to work the
shores,” say they, “’cause there’s a little danger.
They fears as how we’ll get suffocated, at least
they tells us so; but they don’t care if we get
starved! no, they doesn’t mind nothink about
that.”</p>

<p>It is, however, more than suspected that these
men find plenty of means to evade the vigilance
of the sewer officials, and continue quietly to reap
a considerable harvest, gathered whence it might
otherwise have rotted in obscurity.</p>

<p>The sewer-hunters, strange as it may appear,
are certainly smart fellows, and take decided
precedence of all the other “finders” of London,
whether by land or water, both on account of the
greater amount of their earnings, and the skill
and courage they manifest in the pursuit of their
dangerous employment. But like all who make
a living as it were by a game of chance, plodding,
carefulness, and saving habits cannot be reckoned
among their virtues; they are improvident, even
to a proverb. With their gains, superior even to
those of the better-paid artizans, and far beyond
the amount received by many clerks, who have
to maintain a “respectable appearance,” the shore-men
might, with but ordinary prudence, live
well, have comfortable homes, and even be able
to save sufficient to provide for themselves in their
old age. Their practice, however, is directly the
reverse. They no sooner make a “haul,” as they
say, than they adjourn to some low public-house
in the neighbourhood, and seldom leave till
empty pockets and hungry stomachs drive them
forth to procure the means for a fresh debauch.
It is principally on this account that, despite
their large gains, they are to be found located in
the most wretched quarter of the metropolis.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that the sewer-hunters
(passing much of their time in the midst of the
noisome vapours generated by the sewers, the
odour of which, escaping upwards from the gratings
in the streets, is dreaded and shunned by all
as something pestilential) would exhibit in their
pallid faces the unmistakable evidence of their
unhealthy employment. But this is far from the
fact. Strange to say, the sewer-hunters are strong,
robust, and healthy men, generally florid in their
complexion, while many of them know illness
only by name. Some of the elder men, who head
the gangs when exploring the sewers, are between
60 and 80 years of age, and have followed the
employment during their whole lives. The men
appear to have a fixed belief that the odour of
the sewers contributes in a variety of ways to
their general health; nevertheless, they admit
that accidents occasionally occur from the air in
some places being fully impregnated with mephitic
gas.</p>

<p>I found one of these men, from whom I derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
much information, and who is really an active
intelligent man, in a court off Rosemary-lane.
Access is gained to this court through a dark
narrow entrance, scarcely wider than a doorway,
running beneath the first floor of one of the
houses in the adjoining street. The court itself is
about 50 yards long, and not more than three
yards wide, surrounded by lofty wooden houses,
with jutting abutments in many of the upper
stories that almost exclude the light, and give them
the appearance of being about to tumble down
upon the heads of the intruders. This court is
densely inhabited; every room has its own family,
more or less in number; and in many of them,
I am assured, there are two families residing, the
better to enable the one to whom the room is let
to pay the rent. At the time of my visit, which
was in the evening, after the inmates had returned
from their various employments, some quarrel had
arisen among them. The court was so thronged
with the friends of the contending individuals and
spectators of the fight that I was obliged to stand
at the entrance, unable to force my way through
the dense multitude, while labourers and street-folk
with shaggy heads, and women with dirty
caps and fuzzy hair, thronged every window
above, and peered down anxiously at the affray.
There must have been some hundreds of people
collected there, and yet all were inhabitants of
this very court, for the noise of the quarrel had
not yet reached the street. On wondering at the
number, my informant, when the noise had ceased,
explained the matter as follows: “You see, sir,
there’s more than 30 houses in this here court,
and there’s not less than eight rooms in every
house; now there’s nine or ten people in some of
the rooms, I knows, but just say four in every
room, and calculate what that there comes to.” I
did, and found it, to my surprise, to be 960.
“Well,” continued my informant, chuckling and
rubbing his hands in evident delight at the result,
“you may as well just tack a couple a
hundred on to the tail o’ them for make-weight,
as we’re not werry pertikler about a hundred
or two one way or the other in these here
places.”</p>

<p>In this court, up three flights of narrow stairs
that creaked and trembled at every footstep, and
in an ill-furnished garret, dwelt the shore-worker&mdash;a
man who, had he been careful, according to
his own account at least, might have money in the
bank and be the proprietor of the house in which
he lived. The sewer-hunters, like the street-people,
are all known by some peculiar nickname, derived
chiefly from some personal characteristic. It
would be a waste of time to inquire for them by
their right names, even if you were acquainted
with them, for none else would know them, and
no intelligence concerning them could be obtained;
while under the title of Lanky Bill,
Long Tom, One-eyed George, Short-armed Jack,
they are known to every one.</p>

<p>My informant, who is also dignified with a title,
or as he calls it a “handle to his name,” gave me
the following account of himself: “I was born in
Birmingham, but afore I recollects anythink, we
came to London. The first thing I remembers is
being down on the shore at Cuckold’s P’int, when
the tide was out and up to my knees in mud, and
a gitting down deeper and deeper every minute till
I was picked up by one of the shore-workers. I
used to git down there every day, to look at the
ships and boats a sailing up and down; I’d niver
be tired a looking at them at that time. At last
father ’prenticed me to a blacksmith in Bermondsey,
<i>and then I couldn’t git down to the river when I
liked, so I got to hate the forge and the fire, and
blowing the bellows, and couldn’t stand the confinement
no how,&mdash;at last I cuts and runs</i>. After
some time they gits me back ag’in, but I cuts ag’in.
I was determined not to stand it. I wouldn’t go
home for fear I’d be sent back, so I goes down to
Cuckold’s P’int and there I sits near half the day,
when who should I see but the old un as had
picked me up out of the mud when I was a
sinking. I tells him all about it, and he takes me
home along with hisself, and gits me a bag and an
o, and takes me out next day, and shows me
what to do, and shows me the dangerous places,
and the places what are safe, and how to rake in
the mud for rope, and bones, and iron, and that’s
the way I comed to be a shore-worker. Lor’ bless
you, I’ve worked Cuckold’s P’int for more nor
twenty year. I know places where you’d go over
head and ears in the mud, and jist alongside on
’em you may walk as safe as you can on this floor.
But it don’t do for a stranger to try it, he’d wery
soon git in, and it’s not so easy to git out agin,
I can tell you. I stay’d with the old un a long
time, and we used to git lots o’ tin, specially when
we’d go to work the sewers. I liked that well
enough. I could git into small places where the
old un couldn’t, and when I’d got near the grating
in the street, I’d search about in the bottom of the
sewer; I’d put down my arm to my shoulder in
the mud and bring up shillings and half-crowns,
and lots of coppers, and plenty other things. I
once found a silver jug as big as a quart pot, and
often found spoons and knives and forks and every
thing you can think of. Bless your heart the
smells nothink; it’s a roughish smell at first, but
nothink near so bad as you thinks, ’cause, you
see, there’s sich lots o’ water always a coming
down the sewer, and the air gits in from the
gratings, and that helps to sweeten it a bit.
There’s some places, ’specially in the old sewers,
where they say there’s foul air, and they tells me
the foul air ’ill cause instantious death, but I niver
met with anythink of the kind, and I think if
there was sich a thing I should know somethink
about it, for I’ve worked the sewers, off and on,
for twenty year. When we comes to a narrow-place
as we don’t know, we takes the candle out
of the lantern and fastens it on the hend of the
o, and then runs it up the sewer, and if the light
stays in, we knows as there a’n’t no danger. We
used to go up the city sewer at Blackfriars-bridge,
but that’s stopped up now; it’s boarded across
inside. The city wouldn’t let us up if they knew
it, ’cause of the danger, they say, but they don’t
care if we hav’n’t got nothink to eat nor a place to
put our heads in, while there’s plenty of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
lying there and good for nobody. If you was
caught up it and brought afore the Lord Mayor,
he’d give you fourteen days on it, as safe as the
bellows, so a good many on us now is afraid to
wenture in. We don’t wenture as we used to,
but still it’s done at times. There’s a many places
as I knows on where the bricks has fallen down,
and that there’s dangerous; it’s so delaberated
that if you touches it with your head or with the
hend of the o, it ’ill all come down atop o’ you.
I’ve often seed as many as a hundred rats at once,
and they’re woppers in the sewers, I can tell you;
them there water rats, too, is far more ferociouser
than any other rats, and they’d think nothink of
tackling a man, if they found they couldn’t get
away no how, but if they can why they runs by and
gits out o’ the road. I knows a chap as the rats
tackled in the sewers; they bit him hawfully: you
must ha’ heard on it; it was him as the watermen
went in arter when they heard him a shouting
as they was a rowin’ by. Only for the watermen
the rats would ha’ done for him, safe enough. Do
you recollect hearing on the man as was found in
the sewers about twelve year ago?&mdash;oh you must&mdash;the
rats eat every bit of him, and left nothink but
his bones. I knowed him well, he was a rig’lar
shore-worker.</p>

<p>“The rats is wery dangerous, that’s sartain, but
we always goes three or four on us together, and
the varmint’s too wide awake to tackle us then,
for they know they’d git off second best. You can
go a long way in the sewers if you like; I don’t
know how far. I niver was at the end on
them myself, for a cove can’t stop in longer than
six or seven hour, ’cause of the tide; you must
be out before that’s up. There’s a many
branches on ivery side, but we don’t go into
all; we go where we know, and where we’re
always sure to find somethink. I know a
place now where there’s more than two or three
hundred weight of metal all rusted together, and
plenty of money among it too; but it’s too heavy
to carry it out, so it ’ill stop there I s’pose till
the world comes to an end. I often brought
out a piece of metal half a hundred in weight,
and took it under the harch of the bridge, and
broke it up with a large stone to pick out the
money. I’ve found sovereigns and half sovereigns
over and over ag’in, and three on us has often
cleared a couple of pound apiece in one day out
of the sewers. But we no sooner got the money
than the publican had it. I only wish I’d back
all the money I’ve guv to the publican, and I
wouldn’t care how the wind blew for the rest of
my life. I never thought about taking a hammer
along with me into the sewer, no; I never thought
I’d want it. You can’t go in every day, the tides
don’t answer, and they’re so pertikler now, far
more pertikler than formerly; if you was known
to touch the traps, you’d git hauled up afore the
beak. It’s done for all that, and though there <i>is</i>
so many eyes about. The “Johnnys” on the
water are always on the look out, and if they sees
any on us about, we has to cut our lucky. We
shore workers sometimes does very well other
ways. When we hears of a fire anywheres, we
goes and watches where they shoots the rubbish,
and then we goes and sifts it over, and washes it
afterwards, then all the metal sinks to the bottom.
The way we does it is this here: we takes a
barrel cut in half, and fills it with water, and then
we shovels in the siftings, and stirs ’em round and
round and round with a stick; then we throws
out that water and puts in some fresh, and stirs
that there round ag’in; arter some time the water
gets clear, and every thing heavy’s fell to the bottom,
and then we sees what it is and picks it out.
I’ve made from a pound to thirty shilling a day, at
that there work on lead alone. The time the Parliament
Houses was burnt, the rubbish was shot in
Hyde Park, and Long <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span> and I goes to work it,
and while we were at it, we didn’t make less nor
three pounds apiece a day; we found sovereigns
and half sovereigns, and lots of silver half melted
away, and jewellery, such as rings, and stones,
and brooches; but we never got half paid for
them. I found two sets of bracelets for a lady’s
arms, and took ’em to a jeweller, and he tried
them jist where the “great” heat had melted the
catch away, and found they was only metal double
plated, or else he said as how he’d give us thirty
pounds for them; howsomever, we takes them
down to a Jew in Petticoat-lane, who used to buy
things of us, and he gives us 7<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for ’em. We
found so many things, that at last Long <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
I got to quarrel about the “whacking;” there was
cheatin’ a goin’ on; it wasn’t all fair and above
board as it ought to be, so we gits to fightin’, and
kicks up sich a jolly row, that they wouldn’t let
us work no more, and takes and buries the whole
on the rubbish. There’s plenty o’ things under
the ground along with it now, if anybody could
git at them. There was jist two loads o’ rubbish
shot at one time in Bishop Bonner’s-fields, which
I worked by myself, and what do you think I
made out of that there?&mdash;why I made 3<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> The
rubbish was got out of a cellar, what hadn’t been
stirred for fifty year or more, so I thinks there
ought to be somethink in it, and I keeps my eye
on it, and watches where it’s shot; then I turns
to work, and the first thing I gits hold on is a
chain, which I takes to be copper; it was so
dirty, but it turned out to be all solid goold, and
I gets 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for it from the Jew; arter that I
finds lots o’ coppers, and silver money, and many
things besides. <i>The reason I likes this sort of life
is, ’cause I can sit down when I likes, and nobody
can’t order me about. When I’m hard up, I
knows as how I must work, and then I goes at it
like sticks a breaking</i>; and tho’ the times isn’t as
they was, I can go now and pick up my four or
five bob a day, where another wouldn’t know how
to get a brass farden.”</p>

<p>There is a strange tale in existence among the
shore-workers, of a race of wild hogs inhabiting the
sewers in the neighbourhood of Hampstead. The
story runs, that a sow in young, by some accident
got down the sewer through an opening, and,
wandering away from the spot, littered and reared
her offspring in the drain, feeding on the offal
and garbage washed into it continually. Here, it
is alleged, the breed multiplied exceedingly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
have become almost as ferocious as they are
numerous. This story, apocryphal as it seems,
has nevertheless its believers, and it is ingeniously
argued, that the reason why none of the subterranean
animals have been able to make their way to
the light of day is, that they could only do so by
reaching the mouth of the sewer at the river-side,
while, in order to arrive at that point, they must
necessarily encounter the Fleet ditch, which runs
towards the river with great rapidity, and as it is
the obstinate nature of a pig to swim <i>against</i> the
stream, the wild hogs of the sewers invariably
work their way back to their original quarters, and
are thus never to be seen. What seems strange
in the matter is, that the inhabitants of Hampstead
never have been known to see any of these
animals pass beneath the gratings, nor to have
been disturbed by their gruntings. The reader
of course can believe as much of the story as he
pleases, and it is right to inform him that the sewer-hunters
themselves have never yet encountered
any of the fabulous monsters of the Hampstead
sewers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Mud-Larks.</span></h3>

<p>There is another class who may be termed river-finders,
although their occupation is connected
only with the shore; they are commonly known
by the name of “mud-larks,” from being compelled,
in order to obtain the articles they seek, to wade
sometimes up to their middle through the mud left
on the shore by the retiring tide. These poor
creatures are certainly about the most deplorable
in their appearance of any I have met with in the
course of my inquiries. They may be seen of all
ages, from mere childhood to positive decrepitude,
crawling among the barges at the various wharfs
along the river; it cannot be said that they are clad
in rags, for they are scarcely half covered by the
tattered indescribable things that serve them for
clothing; their bodies are grimed with the foul
soil of the river, and their torn garments stiffened
up like boards with dirt of every possible description.</p>

<p>Among the mud-larks may be seen many old
women, and it is indeed pitiable to behold them, especially
during the winter, bent nearly double with age
and infirmity, paddling and groping among the
wet mud for small pieces of coal, chips of wood,
or any sort of refuse washed up by the tide. These
women always have with them an old basket or
an old tin kettle, in which they put whatever they
chance to find. It usually takes them a whole
tide to fill this receptacle, but when filled, it is as
much as the feeble old creatures are able to carry
home.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE MUD-LARK.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The mud-larks generally live in some court
or alley in the neighbourhood of the river,
and, as the tide recedes, crowds of boys and
little girls, some old men, and many old women,
may be observed loitering about the various
stairs, watching eagerly for the opportunity to
commence their labours. When the tide is sufficiently
low they scatter themselves along the
shore, separating from each other, and soon disappear
among the craft lying about in every direction.
This is the case on both sides of the river,
as high up as there is anything to be found, extending
as far as Vauxhall-bridge, and as low down
as Woolwich. The mud-larks themselves, however,
know only those who reside near them, and
whom they are accustomed to meet in their daily
pursuits; indeed, with but few exceptions, these
people are dull, and apparently stupid; this is observable
particularly among the boys and girls, who,
when engaged in searching the mud, hold but
little converse one with another. The men and
women may be passed and repassed, but they
notice no one; they never speak, but with a stolid
look of wretchedness they plash their way through
the mire, their bodies bent down while they peer
anxiously about, and occasionally stoop to pick up
some paltry treasure that falls in their way.</p>

<p>The mud-larks collect whatever they happen to
find, such as coals, bits of old-iron, rope, bones,
and copper nails that drop from ships while lying
or repairing along shore. Copper nails are the
most valuable of all the articles they find, but
these they seldom obtain, as they are always
driven from the neighbourhood of a ship while
being new-sheathed. Sometimes the younger
and bolder mud-larks venture on sweeping some
empty coal-barge, and one little fellow with whom
I spoke, having been lately caught in the act of
so doing, had to undergo for the offence seven
days’ imprisonment in the House of Correction:
this, he says, he liked much better than mud-larking,
for while he staid there he wore a coat and shoes
and stockings, and though he had not over much
to eat, he certainly was never afraid of going to
bed without anything at all&mdash;as he often had to
do when at liberty. He thought he would try
it on again in the winter, he told me, saying, it
would be so comfortable to have clothes and shoes
and stockings then, and not be obliged to go into
the cold wet mud of a morning.</p>

<p>The coals that the mud-larks find, they sell to
the poor people of the neighbourhood at 1<i>d.</i> per
pot, holding about 14 lbs. The iron and bones
and rope and copper nails which they collect, they
sell at the rag-shops. They dispose of the iron
at 5 lbs. for 1<i>d.</i>, the bones at 3 lbs. a 1<i>d.</i>, rope
a &frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb. wet, and &frac34;<i>d.</i> per lb. dry, and copper
nails at the rate of 4<i>d.</i> per lb. They occasionally
pick up tools, such as saws and hammers;
these they dispose of to the seamen for
biscuit and meat, and sometimes sell them at
the rag-shops for a few halfpence. In this manner
they earn from 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per day, but
rarely the latter sum; their average gains may
be estimated at about 3<i>d.</i> per day. The boys,
after leaving the river, sometimes scrape their
trousers, and frequent the cab-stands, and try to
earn a trifle by opening the cab-doors for those
who enter them, or by holding gentlemen’s horses.
Some of them go, in the evening, to a ragged
school, in the neighbourhood of which they live;
more, as they say, because other boys go there,
than from any desire to learn.</p>

<p>At one of the stairs in the neighbourhood of
the pool, I collected about a dozen of these unfortunate
children; there was not one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
over twelve years of age, and many of them were
but six. It would be almost impossible to describe
the wretched group, so motley was their appearance,
so extraordinary their dress, and so stolid
and inexpressive their countenances. Some carried
baskets, filled with the produce of their morning’s
work, and others old tin kettles with iron handles.
Some, for want of these articles, had old hats filled
with the bones and coals they had picked up; and
others, more needy still, had actually taken the
caps from their own heads, and filled them with
what they had happened to find. The muddy
slush was dripping from their clothes and utensils,
and forming a puddle in which they stood. There
did not appear to be among the whole group as
many filthy cotton rags to their backs as, when
stitched together, would have been sufficient to
form the material of one shirt. There were the
remnants of one or two jackets among them, but
so begrimed and tattered that it would have been
difficult to have determined either the original material
or make of the garment. On questioning
one, he said his father was a coal-backer; he had
been dead eight years; the boy was nine years
old. His mother was alive; she went out charing
and washing when she could get any such work
to do. She had 1<i>s.</i> a day when she could get employment,
but that was not often; he remembered
once to have had a pair of shoes, but it was a long
time since. “It is very cold in winter,” he said,
“to stand in the mud without shoes,” but he did
not mind it in summer. He had been three years
mud-larking, and supposed he should remain a
mud-lark all his life. What else could he be? for
there was nothing else that he knew <i>how</i> to do.
Some days he earned 1<i>d.</i>, and some days 4<i>d.</i>; he
never earned 8<i>d.</i> in one day, that would have
been a “jolly lot of money.” He never found
a saw or a hammer, he “only wished” he could,
they would be glad to get hold of them at the
dolly’s. He had been one month at school
before he went mud-larking. Some time ago
he had gone to the ragged-school; but he no
longer went there, for he forgot it. He could
neither read nor write, and did not think he could
learn if he tried “ever so much.” He didn’t know
what religion his father and mother were, nor did
know what religion meant. God was God, he
said. He had heard he was good, but didn’t
know what good he was to him. He thought he
was a Christian, but he didn’t know what a
Christian was. He had heard of Jesus Christ
once, when he went to a Catholic chapel, but he
never heard tell of who or what he was, and
didn’t “particular care” about knowing. His
father and mother were born in Aberdeen, but he
didn’t know where Aberdeen was. London was
England, and England, he said, was in London,
but he couldn’t tell in what part. He could not
tell where he would go to when he died, and
didn’t believe any one could tell <i>that</i>. Prayers, he
told me, were what people said to themselves at
night. <i>He</i> never said any, and didn’t know any;
his mother sometimes used to speak to him about
them, but he could never learn any. His mother
didn’t go to church or to chapel, because she had
no clothes. All the money he got he gave to his
mother, and she bought bread with it, and when
they had no money they lived the best way they
could.</p>

<p>Such was the amount of intelligence manifested
by this unfortunate child.</p>

<p>Another was only seven years old. He stated
that his father was a sailor who had been hurt on
board ship, and been unable to go to sea for the
last two years. He had two brothers and a sister,
one of them older than himself; and his elder
brother was a mud-lark like himself. The two
had been mud-larking more than a year; they
went because they saw other boys go, and knew
that they got money for the things they found.
They were often hungry, and glad to do anything
to get something to eat. Their father was not
able to earn anything, and their mother could get
but little to do. They gave all the money they
earned to their mother. They didn’t gamble, and
play at pitch and toss when they had got some
money, but some of the big boys did on the
Sunday, when they didn’t go a mud-larking. He
couldn’t tell why they did nothing on a Sunday,
“only they didn’t;” though sometimes they looked
about to see where the best place would be on the
next day. He didn’t go to the ragged school; he
should like to know how to read a book, though he
couldn’t tell what good it would do him. He
didn’t like mud larking, would be glad of something
else, but didn’t know anything else that he
could do.</p>

<p>Another of the boys was the son of a dock
labourer,&mdash;casually employed. He was between
seven and eight years of age, and his sister, who
was also a mud-lark, formed one of the group.
The mother of these two was dead, and there
were three children younger than themselves.</p>

<p>The rest of the histories may easily be imagined,
for there was a painful uniformity in the stories
of all the children: they were either the children
of the very poor, who, by their own improvidence
or some overwhelming calamity, had
been reduced to the extremity of distress, or else
they were orphans, and compelled from utter
destitution to seek for the means of appeasing their
hunger in the mud of the river. That the majority
of this class are ignorant, and without even the
rudiments of education, and that many of them
from time to time are committed to prison for petty
thefts, cannot be wondered at. Nor can it even
excite our astonishment that, once within the walls
of a prison, and finding how much more comfortable
it is than their previous condition, they should
return to it repeatedly. As for the females
growing up under such circumstances, the worst
may be anticipated of them; and in proof of this
I have found, upon inquiry, that very many of the
unfortunate creatures who swell the tide of prostitution
in Ratcliff-highway, and other low neighbourhoods
in the East of London, have originally
been mud-larks; and only remained at that occupation
till such time as they were capable of
adopting the more easy and more lucrative life of
the prostitute.</p>

<p>As to the numbers and earnings of the mud-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>larks,
the following calculations fall short of, rather
than exceed, the truth. From Execution Dock to
the lower part of Limehouse Hole, there are 14
stairs or landing-places, by which the mud-larks
descend to the shore in order to pursue their
employment. There are about as many on the
opposite side of the water similarly frequented.</p>

<p>At King James’ Stairs, in Wapping Wall, which
is nearly a central position, from 40 to 50 mud-larks
go down daily to the river; the mud-larks
“using” the other stairs are not so numerous. If,
therefore, we reckon the number of stairs on both
sides of the river at 28, and the average number
of mud-larks frequenting them at 10 each, we
shall have a total of 280. Each mud-lark, it
has been shown, earns on an average 3<i>d.</i> a day, or
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week; so that the annual earnings of
each will be 3<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i>, or say 4<i>l.</i>, a year, and hence
the gross earnings of the 280 will amount to rather
more than 1000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>But there are, in addition to the mud-larks employed
in the neighbourhood of what may be
called the pool, many others who work down the
river at various places as far as Blackwall, on the one
side, and at Deptford, Greenwich, and Woolwich,
on the other. These frequent the neighbourhoods
of the various “yards” along shore, where vessels
are being built; and whence, at certain times,
chips, small pieces of wood, bits of iron, and
copper nails, are washed out into the river. There
is but little doubt that this portion of the class
earn much more than the mud-larks of the pool,
seeing that they are especially convenient to the
places where the iron vessels are constructed; so
that the presumption is, that the number of mud-larks
“at work” on the banks of the Thames
(especially if we include those above bridge), and
the value of the property extracted by them from
the mud of the river, may be fairly estimated at
double that which is stated above, or say 550
gaining 2000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the doctrines I have endeavoured
to enforce throughout this publication,
I cite the following history of one of the above
class. It may serve to teach those who are still
sceptical as to the degrading influence of circumstances
upon the poor, that many of the humbler
classes, if placed in the same easy position as ourselves,
would become, perhaps, quite as “respectable”
members of society.</p>

<p>The lad of whom I speak was discovered by
me now nearly two years ago “mud-larking” on
the banks of the river near the docks. He was
a quick, intelligent little fellow, and had been at
the business, he told me, about three years. He
had taken to mud-larking, he said, because his
clothes were too bad for him to look for anything
better. He worked every day, with 20
or 30 boys, who might all be seen at daybreak
with their trowsers tucked up, groping
about, and picking out the pieces of coal from
the mud on the banks of the Thames. He went
into the river up to his knees, and in searching
the mud he often ran pieces of glass and long
nails into his feet. When this was the case, he
went home and dressed the wounds, but returned
to the river-side directly, “for should the tide
come up,” he added, “without my having found
something, why I must starve till next low tide.”
In the very cold weather he and his other shoeless
companions used to stand in the hot water
that ran down the river side from some of the
steam-factories, to warm their frozen feet.</p>

<p>At first he found it difficult to keep his footing
in the mud, and he had known many beginners
fall in. He came to my house, at my request, the
morning after my first meeting with him. It
was the depth of winter, and the poor little fellow
was nearly destitute of clothing. His trousers
were worn away up to his knees, he had no shirt,
and his legs and feet (which were bare) were
covered with chilblains. On being questioned by
me he gave the following account of his <span class="lock">life:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>He was fourteen years old. He had two
sisters, one fifteen and the other twelve years of
age. His father had been dead nine years. The
man had been a coal-whipper, and, from getting
his work from one of the publican employers in
those days, had become a confirmed drunkard.
When he married he held a situation in a warehouse,
where his wife managed the first year to
save 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> out of her husband’s earnings; but
from the day he took to coal-whipping she had
never saved one halfpenny, indeed she and her
children were often left to starve. The man
(whilst in a state of intoxication) had fallen between
two barges, and the injuries he received
had been so severe that he had lingered in a
helpless state for three years before his death.
After her husband’s decease the poor woman’s
neighbours subscribed 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for her; with this
sum she opened a greengrocer’s shop, and got on
very well for five years.</p>

<p>When the boy was nine years old his mother
sent him to the Red Lion school at Green-bank,
near Old Gravel-lane, Ratcliffe-highway; she paid
1<i>d.</i> a week for his learning. He remained there
for a year; then the potato-rot came, and his
mother lost upon all she bought. About the
same time two of her customers died 30<i>s.</i> in her
debt; this loss, together with the potato-disease,
completely ruined her, and the whole family had
been in the greatest poverty from that period.
Then she was obliged to take all her children
from their school, that they might help to keep
themselves as best they could. Her eldest girl
sold fish in the streets, and the boy went to the
river-side to “pick up” his living. The change,
however, was so great that shortly afterwards
the little fellow lay ill eighteen weeks with the
ague. As soon as the boy recovered his mother
and his two sisters were “taken bad” with
a fever. The poor woman went into the “Great
House,” and the children were taken to the Fever
Hospital. When the mother returned home she
was too weak to work, and all she had to depend
on was what her boy brought from the river.
They had nothing to eat and no money until
the little fellow had been down to the shore and
picked up some coals, selling them for a trifle.
“And hard enough he had to work for what he
got, poor boy,” said his mother to me on a future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
occasion, sobbing; “still he never complained,
but was quite proud when he brought home
enough for us to get a bit of meat with; and
when he has sometimes seen me down-hearted,
he has clung round my neck, and assured me
that one day God would see us cared for if I
would put my trust in Him.” As soon as his
mother was well enough she sold fruit in the
streets, or went out washing when she could get
a day’s work.</p>

<p>The lad suffered much from the pieces of broken
glass in the mud. Some little time before I met
with him he had run a copper nail into his foot.
This lamed him for three months, and his mother
was obliged to carry him on her back every morning
to the doctor. As soon, however, as he could
“hobble” (to use his mother’s own words) he
went back to the river, and often returned (after
many hours’ hard work in the mud) with only a
few pieces of coal, not enough to sell even to get
them a bit of bread. One evening, as he was
warming his feet in the water that ran from a
steam factory, he heard some boys talking about
the Ragged School in High-street, Wapping.</p>

<p>“They was saying what they used to learn
there,” added the boy. “They asked me to come
along with them for it was great fun. They told
me that all the boys used to be laughing and
making game of the master. They said they used
to put out the gas and chuck the slates all about.
They told me, too, that there was a good fire there,
so I went to have a warm and see what it was
like. When I got there the master was very
kind to me. They used to give us tea-parties, and
to keep us quiet they used to show us the magic
lantern. I soon got to like going there, and went
every night for six months. There was about 40 or
50 boys in the school. The most of them was
thieves, and they used to go thieving the coals out
of barges along shore, and cutting the ropes off ships,
and going and selling it at the rag-shops. They
used to get &frac34;<i>d.</i> a lb. for the rope when dry, and &frac12;<i>d.</i>
when wet. Some used to steal pudding out of shops
and hand it to those outside, and the last boy it
was handed to would go off with it. They used to
steal bacon and bread sometimes as well. About
half of the boys at the school was thieves. Some had
work to do at ironmongers, lead-factories, engineers,
soap-boilers, and so on, and some had no work
to do and was good boys still. After we came
out of school at nine o’clock at night, some of the
bad boys would go a thieving, perhaps half-a-dozen
and from that to eight would go out in a gang
together. There was one big boy of the name of
<span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>; he was 18 years old, and is in prison now
for stealing bacon; I think he is in the House of
Correction. This <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> used to go out of school
before any of us, and wait outside the door as the
other boys came out. Then he would call the
boys he wanted for his gangs on one side, and tell
them where to go and steal. He used to look out
in the daytime for shops where things could be
‘prigged,’ and at night he would tell the boys to
go to them. He was called the captain of the
gangs. He had about three gangs altogether with
him, and there were from six to eight boys in each
gang. The boys used to bring what they stole to
<span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and he used to share it with them. I belonged
to one of the gangs. There were six boys
altogether in my gang; the biggest lad, that
knowed all about the thieving, was the captain of
the gang I was in, and <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> was captain over him
and over all of us.</p>

<p>“There was two brothers of them; you seed
them, sir, the night you first met me. The other
boys, as was in my gang, was <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and
<span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="lock">L&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and <span class="lock">W&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and a boy we
used to call ‘Tim;’ these, with myself, used to
make up one of the gangs, and we all of us used
to go a thieving every night after school-hours.
When the tide would be right up, and we
had nothing to do along shore, we used to go
thieving in the daytime as well. It was <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="lock">L&mdash;&mdash;</span>, as first put me up
to go thieving; they took me with them, one
night, up the lane [New Gravel-lane], and I see
them take some bread out of a baker’s, and they
wasn’t found out; and, after that, I used to go
with them regular. Then I joined <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s
gang; and, after that, <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> came and told us
that his gang could do better than ourn, and he
asked us to join our gang to his’n, and we did so.
Sometimes we used to make 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> a day;
or about 6<i>d.</i> apiece. While waiting outside the
school-doors, before they opened, we used to plan
up where we would go thieving after school was
over. I was taken up once for thieving coals
myself, but I was let go again.”</p>

<p>I was so much struck with the boy’s truthfulness
of manner, that I asked him, <i>would</i>, he
really lead a different life, if he saw a means
of so doing? He assured me he would, and
begged me earnestly to try him. Upon his
leaving me, 2<i>s.</i> were given him for his trouble.
This small sum (I afterwards learned) kept the
family for more than a fortnight. The girl laid it
out in sprats (it being then winter-time); these
she sold in the streets.</p>

<p>I mentioned the fact to a literary friend, who
interested himself in the boy’s welfare; and eventually
succeeded in procuring him a situation at an
eminent printer’s. The subjoined letter will show
how the lad conducted himself while there.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="blockquot">
“Whitefriars, April 22, 1850.
</p>

<p>“Messrs. Bradbury and Evans beg to say that the
boy J. C. has conducted himself in a very satisfactory
manner since he has been in their employment.”</p></div>

<p>The same literary friend took the girl into his
service. She is in a situation still, though not in
the same family.</p>

<p>The boy now holds a good situation at one of the
daily newspaper offices. So well has he behaved
himself, that, a few weeks since, his wages were
increased from 6<i>s.</i> to 9<i>s.</i> per week. His mother
(owing to the boy’s exertions) has now a little
shop, and is doing well.</p>

<p>This simple story requires no comments, and is
narrated here in the hope that it may teach many
to know how often the poor boys reared in the
gutter are thieves, merely because society forbids
them being honest lads.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the London Dustmen, Nightmen, Sweeps,
and Scavengers.</span></h3>

<p>These men constitute a large body, and are a
class who, all things considered, do their work
silently and efficiently. Almost without the cognisance
of the mass of the people, the refuse is
removed from our streets and houses; and London,
as if in the care of a tidy housewife, is <i>always</i>
being cleaned. Great as are the faults and absurdities
of many parts of our system of public
cleansing, nevertheless, when compared with the
state of things in any continental capital, the
superiority of the metropolis of Great Britain is
indisputable.</p>

<p>In all this matter there is little merit to be
attributed to the workmen, except that they may
be well drilled; for the majority of them are as
much machines, apart from their animation, as are
the cane and whalebone made to cleanse the
chimney, or the clumsy-looking machine which,
in its progress, is a vehicular scavenger, sweeping
as it goes.</p>

<p>These public cleansers are to be thus <span class="lock">classified:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Dustmen, or those who empty and remove
the collection of ashes, bones, vegetables, &amp;c.,
deposited in the dust-bins, or other refuse receptacles
throughout the metropolis.</p>

<p>2. Nightmen, or those who remove the contents
of the cesspools.</p>

<p>3. Sweeps, or those who remove the soot from
the chimneys.</p>

<p>4. Scavengers, or those who remove the dirt
from the streets, roads, and markets.</p>

<p>Let me, however, before proceeding further
with the subject, lay before the reader the following
important return as to the extent and contents
of this prodigious city: for this document I am
indebted to the Commissioners of Police, gentlemen
from whom I have derived the most valuable
information since the commencement of my inquiries,
and to whose courtesy and consideration
I am anxious to acknowledge my many obligations.</p>

<p>But if the extent of even this “inner district”
be so vast as almost to overpower the mind with
its magnitude&mdash;if its population be greater than
that of the entire kingdom of Hanover, and almost
equal to that of the republic of Switzerland&mdash;if
its houses be so numerous that placed side by side
they would form one continuous line of dwellings
from its centre to Moscow&mdash;if its streets and roads
be nearly equal in length to one quarter of the
diameter of the earth itself,&mdash;what a task must the
cleansing of such a bricken wilderness be, and yet,
assuredly, though it be by far the greatest, it is
at the same time by far the cleanest city in the
world.</p>

<p>The removal of the refuse of a large town is,
perhaps, one of the most important of social operations.
Not only is it necessary for the well-being
of a vast aggregation of people that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
ordure should be removed from both within and
around their dwellings as soon as it is generated,
but nature, ever working in a circle and reproducing
in the same ratio as she destroys, has made
this same ordure not only the cause of present
disease when allowed to remain within the city,
but the means of future health and sustenance
when removed to the fields.</p>

<p>In a leading article in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
written about two years since, I <span class="lock">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“That man gets his bones from the rocks and
his muscles from the atmosphere, is beyond all
doubt. The iron in his blood and the lime in
his teeth were originally in the soil. But these
could not be in his body unless they had previously
formed part of his food. And yet we can
neither live on air nor on stones. We cannot
grow fat upon lime, and iron is positively indigestible
in our stomachs. It is by means of the
vegetable creation alone that we are enabled to
convert the mineral into flesh and blood. The
only apparent use of herbs and plants is to change
the inorganic earth, air, and water, into organic
substances fitted for the nutrition of animals.
The little lichen, which, by means of the oxalic
acid that it secretes, decomposes the rocks to which
it clings, and fits their lime for ‘assimilation’ with
higher organisms, is, as it were, but the primitive
bone-maker of the world. By what subtle transmutation
inorganic nature is changed into organic,
and dead inert matter quickened with life, is far
beyond us even to conjecture. Suffice it that an
express apparatus is required for the process&mdash;a
special mechanism to convert the ‘<i>crust</i> of the
earth,’ as it is called, into food for man and beast.</p>

<p>“Now, in Nature everything moves in a circle&mdash;perpetually
changing, and yet ever returning
to the point whence it started. Our bodies are
continually decomposing and recomposing&mdash;indeed,
the very process of breathing is but one of decomposition.
As animals live on vegetables, even
so is the refuse of the animal the vegetable’s food.
The carbonic acid which comes from our lungs,
and which is poison for us to inhale, is not only
the vital air of plants, but positively their nutriment.
With the same wondrous economy that
marks all creation, it has been ordained that what
is unfitted for the support of the superior organisms,
is of all substances the best adapted to give
strength and vigour to the inferior. That which
we excrete as pollution to our system, they secrete
as nourishment to theirs. Plants are not only
Nature’s scavengers but Nature’s purifiers. They
remove the filth from the earth, as well as disinfect
the atmosphere, and fit it to be breathed by
a higher order of beings. Without the vegetable
creation the animal could neither have been nor
be. Plants not only fitted the earth originally for
the residence of man and the brute, but to this
day they continue to render it habitable to us.
For this end their nature has been made the very
antithesis to ours. The process by which we live
is the process by which they are destroyed. That
which supports respiration in us produces putrefaction
in them. What our lungs throw off, their lungs
absorb&mdash;what our bodies reject, their roots imbibe.</p>

<p>“Hence, in order that the balance of waste
and supply should be maintained&mdash;that the principle
of universal compensation should be kept up,
and that what is rejected by us should go to the
sustenance of plants, Nature has given us several
instinctive motives to remove our refuse from us.
She has not only constituted that which we egest
the most loathsome of all things to our senses and
imagination, but she has rendered its effluvium
highly pernicious to our health&mdash;sulphuretted
hydrogen being at once the most deleterious and
offensive of all gases. Consequently, as in all other
cases where the great law of Nature has to be
enforced by special sanctions, a double motive has
been given us to do that which it is necessary for us
to do, and thus it has been made not only advantageous
to us to remove our refuse to the fields,
but positively detrimental to our health, and disgusting
to our senses, to keep it in the neighbourhood
of our houses.</p>

<p>“In every well-regulated State, therefore, an
effective and rapid means for carrying off the ordure
of the people to a locality where it may be
fruitful instead of destructive, becomes a most important
consideration. Both the health and the
wealth of the nation depend upon it. If to make two
blades of wheat grow where one grew before is to
confer a benefit on the world, surely to remove
that which will enable us at once to do this, and
to purify the very air which we breathe, as well
as the water which we drink, must be a still greater
boon to society. It is, in fact, to give the community
not only a double amount of food, but a
double amount of health to enjoy it. We are now
beginning to understand this. Up to the present
time we have only thought of removing our refuse&mdash;the
idea of using it never entered our minds.
It was not until science taught us the dependence
of one order of creation upon another, that we
began to see that what appeared worse than worthless
to us was Nature’s capital&mdash;<i>wealth set aside
for future production</i>.”</p>

<p>In connection with this part of the subject,
viz., the use of human refuse, I would here draw
attention to those erroneous notions, as to the
multiplication of the people, which teach us to
look upon the increase of the population beyond
certain limits as the greatest possible evil that can
befall a community. Population, it is said, multiplies
itself in a geometrical ratio, whereas the
produce of the land is increased only in arithmetical
proportion; that is to say, while the
people are augmented after the rate <span class="lock">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
2  4  8  16  32  64<br />
</p>

<p>the quantity of food for them can be extended
only in the following <span class="lock">degrees:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
2  4  6  8  10  12<br />
</p>

<p>The cause of this is said to be that, after a certain
stage in the cultivation of the soil, the increase
of the produce from land is not in proportion to
the increase of labour devoted to it; that is to
say, doubling the labour does not double the
crop; and hence it is asserted that the human
race increasing at a quicker rate than the food,
insufficient sustenance must be the necessary lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of a portion of the people in every densely-populated
community.</p>

<p>That men of intelligence and education should
have been persuaded by so plausible a doctrine at
the time of its first promulgation may be readily
conceived, for then the notions concerning organic
chemistry were vague in the extreme, and the
great universal law of Waste and Supply remained
to be fully developed; but that men pretending
to the least scientific knowledge should in these
days be found advocating the Population Theory
is only another of the many proofs of the indisposition
of even the strongest minds to abandon
their pet prejudices. Assuredly Malthus and
Liebig are incompatible. If the new notions as
to the chemistry of vegetation be true, then must
the old notions as to population be utterly unfounded.
If what we excrete plants secrete&mdash;if
what we exhale they inspire&mdash;if our refuse is their
food&mdash;then it follows that to increase the population
is to increase the quantity of manure, while to increase
the manure is to augment the food of plants,
and consequently the plants themselves. If the
plants nourish us, we at least nourish them. It
seems never to have occurred to the economists
that plants themselves required sustenance, and
consequently they never troubled themselves to
inquire whence they derived the elements of their
growth. Had they done this they would never have
even expected that a double quantity of mere
labour upon the soil should have doubled the produce;
but they would rather have seen that it was
utterly impossible for the produce to be doubled
without the food in the soil being doubled likewise;
that is to say, they would have perceived
that plants could not, whatever the labour exerted
upon their cultivation, extract the elements of
their organization from the earth and air, unless
those elements previously existed in the land and
atmosphere in which they grew, and that such
elements, moreover, could not exist there without
some organic being to egest them.</p>

<p>This doctrine of the universal Compensation
extending throughout the material world, and
more especially through the animal and vegetable
kingdom, is, perhaps, one of the grandest and
most consoling that science has yet revealed to
us, making each mutually dependent on the
other, and so contributing each to the other’s
support. Moreover it is the more comforting, as
enabling us almost to demonstrate the falsity of a
creed which is opposed to every generous impulse
of our nature, and which is utterly irreconcilable
with the attributes of the Creator.</p>

<p>“Thanks to organic chemistry,” I said two
years ago in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, “we are
beginning to wake up. Science has taught us
that the removal of the ordure of towns to the
fields is a question that concerns not only our
health, but, what is a far more important consideration
with us, our breeches pockets. What
we, in our ignorance, had mistaken for refuse of
the vilest kind, we have now learned to regard as
being, with reference to its fertilizing virtues, ‘a
precious ore, running in rich veins beneath the
surface of our streets.’ Whereas, if allowed to
reek and seethe in cesspools within scent of our
very hearths, or to pollute the water that we
use to quench our thirst and cook our food, it
becomes, like all wealth badly applied, converted
into ‘poison:’ as Romeo says of gold to the
<span class="lock">apothecary&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">‘Doing more murders in this loathsome world</div>
      <div class="verse">Than those poor compounds which thou mayst not sell.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Formerly, in our eagerness to get rid of the
pollution, we had literally not looked beyond our
noses: hence our only care was to carry off the
nuisance from the immediate vicinity of our own
residences. It was no matter to us what became
of it, so long as it did not taint the atmosphere
around us. This the very instincts of our nature
had made objectionable to us; so we laid down
just as many drains and sewers as would carry
our night-soil to the nearest stream; and thus,
instead of poisoning the air that we breathed, we
poisoned the water that we drank. Then, as the
town extended&mdash;for cities, like mosaic work, are
put together piecemeal&mdash;street being dovetailed to
street, like county to county in our children’s geographical
puzzles&mdash;each new row of houses tailed
on its drains to those of its neighbours, without any
inquiry being made as to whether they were on
the same level or not. The consequence of this
is, that the sewers in many parts of our metropolis
are subject to an ebb and flood like their central
stream, so that the pollution which they remove
at low-water, they regularly bring back at high-water
to the very doors of the houses whence
they carried it.</p>

<p>“According to the average of the returns, from
1841 to 1846, we are paying two millions every
year for guano, bone-dust, and other foreign fertilizers
of our soil. In 1845, we employed no
fewer than 683 ships to bring home 220,000 tons
of animal manure from Ichaboe alone; and yet
we are every day emptying into the Thames
115,000 tons of a substance which has been
proved to be possessed of even greater fertilizing
powers. With 200 tons of the sewage that we
are wont to regard as refuse, applied to the irrigation
of one acre of meadow land, seven crops, we
are told, have been produced in the year, each of
them worth from 6<i>l.</i> to 7<i>l.</i>; so that, considering
the produce to have been doubled by these means,
we have an increase of upwards of 20<i>l.</i> per acre per
annum effected by the application of that refuse to
the surface of our fields. This return is at the rate
of 10<i>l.</i> for every 100 tons of sewage; and, since
the total amount of refuse discharged into the
Thames from the sewers of the metropolis is, in
round numbers, 40,000,000 tons per annum, it
follows that, according to such estimate, we are
positively wasting 4,000,000<i>l.</i> of money every year;
or, rather, <i>it costs us that amount to poison the
waters about us</i>. Or, granting that the fertilizing
power of the metropolitan refuse is&mdash;as it is
said to be&mdash;as great for arable as for pasture-lands,
then for every 200 tons of manure that
we now cast away, we might have an increase of
at least 20 bushels of corn per acre. Consequently
the entire 40,000,000 tons of sewage, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
applied to fatten the land instead of to poison the
water, would, at such a rate of increase, swell
our produce to the extent of 4,000,000 bushels
of wheat per annum. Calculating then that each
of these bushels would yield 16 quartern loaves,
it would follow that we fling into the Thames no
less than 246,000,000 lbs. of bread every year;
or, still worse, by pouring into the river that
which, if spread upon our fields, would enable
thousands to live, we convert the elements of
life and health into the germs of disease and
death, changing into slow but certain poisons that
which, in the subtle transmutation of organic
nature, would become acres of life-sustaining
grain.” I shall have more to say subsequently
on this waste and its consequences.</p>

<p>These considerations show how vastly important
it is that in the best of all possible ways
we should <i>collect</i>, <i>remove</i>, and <i>use</i> the scavengery
and excrementitious matter of our streets and
houses.</p>

<p>Now the removal of the refuse of London is
no slight task, consisting, as it does, of the cleansing
of 1750 miles of streets and roads; of collecting
the dust from 300,000 dust-bins; of
emptying (according to the returns of the Board
of Health) the same number of cesspools, and
sweeping near upon 3,000,000 chimneys.</p>

<p>A task so vast it might naturally be imagined
would give employment to a number of hands,
and yet, if we trusted the returns of the Occupation
Abstract of 1841, the whole of these stupendous
operations are performed by a limited number
of individuals.</p>


<h4>RETURN OF THE NUMBER OF SWEEPS, DUSTMEN, AND NIGHTMEN IN THE
METROPOLIS, ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS OF 1841.</h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="right lightborder" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th rowspan="2">&nbsp;</th><th rowspan="2">Total.</th><th colspan="2">Males.</th><th colspan="2">Females.</th></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Scavengers and Nightmen</td><td>254</td><td>227</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I am informed by persons in the trade that the
“females” here mentioned as chimney-sweepers,
and scavengers, and nightmen, must be such widows
or daughters of sweeps and nightmen as have succeeded
to their businesses, for that no women <i>work</i>
at such trades; excepting, perhaps, in the management
and care of the soot, in assisting to empty and
fill the bags. Many females, however, are employed
in sifting dust, but the calling of the dustman
and dustwoman is not so much as noticed in
the population returns.</p>

<p>According to the occupation abstract of the
previous decennial period, the number of males
of 20 years and upwards (for none others were
mentioned) pursuing the same callings in the
metropolis in 1831, were as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Soot and chimney-sweepers</td><td>421</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nightmen and scavengers</td><td>130</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence the increase in the adult male operatives
belonging to these trades, between 1831 and 1841,
was, for Chimney-sweeps, 198; and Scavengers
and Nightmen, 97.</p>

<p>But these returns are preposterously incorrect.
In the first place it was not until 1842 that the
parliamentary enactment prohibiting the further
employment of climbing-boys for the purpose of
sweeping chimneys came into operation. At that
time the number of inhabited houses in the
metropolis was in round numbers 250,000,
and calculating these to have contained only
eight rooms each, there would have been at the
least 2,000,000 chimneys to sweep. Now, according
to the government returns above cited&mdash;the
London climbing-boys (for the masters did not and
could not climb) in 1841 numbered only 370; at
which rate there would have been but one boy to
no less than 5400 chimneys! Pursuing the same
mode of testing the validity of the “official” statements,
we find, as the nightmen generally work
in gangs of four, that each of the 63, or say 64,
gangs comprised in the census returns, would have
had 4000 cesspools to empty of their contents;
while, working both as scavengers and nightmen
(for, according to the census, they were the <i>only</i>
individuals following those occupations in London),
they would after their nocturnal labours have
had about 27 miles of streets and roads to
cleanse&mdash;a feat which would certainly have
thrown the scavengering prowess of Hercules
into the shade.</p>

<p>Under the respective heads of the dustmen,
nightmen, sweeps, and scavengers, I shall give an
account of the numbers, &amp;c., employed, and a resumé
of the whole. It will be sufficient here to
mention that my investigations lead to the conclusion
that, of men working as dustmen (a portion
of whom are employed as nightmen and scavengers)
there are at present about 1800 in the
metropolis. The census of 1841, as I have
pointed out, mentions no dustman whatever!</p>

<p>But I have so often had instances of the defects
of this national numbering of the people that I have
long since ceased to place much faith in its returns
connected with the humbler grades of labour.
The costermongers, for example, I estimate at
about 10,000, whereas the government reports, as
has been before mentioned, ignore the very existence
of such a class of people, and make the
entire hawkers, hucksters, and pedlars of the
metropolis to amount to no more than 2045.
Again, the London “coal labourers, heavers, and
porters” are said, in the census of 1841, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
only 1700 in number; I find, however, that there
are no less than 1800 “registered” coal-whippers,
and as many coal porters; so that I am in no way
inclined to give great credence to the “official
enumerations.” The difficulties which beset the
perfection of such a document are almost insuperable,
and I have already heard of returns
for the forthcoming document, made by ignorant
people as to their occupations, which already go
far to nullify the facts in connection with the
employment of the ignorant and profligate classes
of the metropolis.</p>

<p>Before quitting this part of the subject, viz.,
the extent of surface, the length of streets, and
the number of houses throughout the metropolis
requiring to be continually cleansed of their refuse,
as well as the number of people as continually engaged
in so cleansing them, let me here append
the last returns of the Registrar General, copied
from the census of 1851, as to the dimensions
and contents of the metropolis according to that
functionary, so that they may be compared with
those of the metropolitan police before given.</p>

<p>In Weale’s “<i>London Exhibited</i>,” which is by
far the most comprehensive description of the
metropolis that I have seen, it is stated that it is
“only possible to adopt a general idea of the
giant city,” as its precise boundaries and extent
cannot be defined. On the north of the Thames,
we are told, London extends to Edmonton and
Finchley; on the west it stretches to Acton and
Hammersmith; on the east it reaches Leyton and
Ham; while on the south of the Thames the
metropolis is said to embrace Wandsworth,
Streatham, Lewisham, Woolwich, and Plumstead.
“To each of these points,” says Mr. Weale, but
upon what authority he does not inform us, “continuous
streets of houses reach; but the solid
mass of houses lies within narrow bounds&mdash;with
these several long arms extending from it. The
greatest length of street, from east to west,” he
adds, “is about fourteen miles, and from north to
south about thirteen miles. The solid mass is
about seven miles by four miles, so that the
ground covered with houses is not less than 20
square miles.”</p>

<p>Mr. McCulloch, in his “<i>London in 1850-51</i>,” has
a passage to the same effect. He says, “The continued
and rapid increase of buildings renders it
difficult to ascertain the extent of the metropolis
at any particular period. If we include in it those
parts only that present a solid mass of houses, its
length from east to west may be taken at six
miles, and its breadth from north to south at
about three miles and a half. There is, however,
a nearly continuous line of houses from Blackwall
to Chelsea, a distance of about seven miles, and
from Walworth to Holloway, of four and a half
miles. The extent of surface covered by buildings
is estimated at about sixteen square miles, or
above 10,000 acres, so that M. Say, the celebrated
French economist, did not really indulge in
hyperbole when he said, ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Londres n’est plus une
ville: c’est une province couverte de maisons!</i>’
(London is no longer a town: it is a province
covered with houses).”</p>

<p>The Government authorities, however, appear
to have very different notions from either of the
above gentlemen as to the extent of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The limits of London, as at present laid down
by the Registrar General, include 176 parishes,
besides several precincts, liberties, and extra-parochial
places, comprising altogether about 115
square miles. According to the old bills of mortality,
London formerly included only 148 parishes,
which were located as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“London,” observes Mr. Weale, “has now
swallowed up many cities, towns, villages, and
separate jurisdictions. The four commonwealths, or
kingdoms, of the Middle Saxons, East Saxons, the
South Rick, and the Kentwaras, once ruled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
its surface. It now embraces the episcopal cities
of London and Westminster, the towns of Woolwich,
Deptford, and Wandsworth, the watering
places of Hampstead, Highgate, Islington, Acton,
and Kilburn, the fishing town of Barking, the
once secluded and ancient villages of Ham, Hornsey,
Sydenham, Lee, Kensington, Fulham, Lambeth,
Clapham, Paddington, Hackney, Chelsea,
Stoke Newington, Newington Butts, Plumstead,
and many others.”</p>

<p>The 176 parishes now included by the Registrar
General within the boundaries of the metropolis, are
arranged by him into five districts, of which the
areas, population, and number of inhabited houses
were on the 31st of March, 1851, as <span class="lock">undermentioned:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In order to be able to compare the average
density of the population in the various parts of
London, I have made a calculation as to the number
of persons and houses to the acre, as well as the
number of inhabitants to each house. I have
also computed the annual rate of increase of the
population from 1841-51, in the several localities
here mentioned, and append the result. It will
be seen that, while what are popularly known as
the suburbs have increased, both in houses and
population, at a considerable rate, some of the more
central parts of London, on the contrary, have decreased
not only in the number of people, but in
the number of dwellings as well. This has been the
case in St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, St. James’s,
Westminster, St. Giles’s, and the City of London.</p>

<p>By the above table we perceive that St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields,
St. James’s, Westminster, St.
Giles’s, the Strand, and the City have all decreased
both in population and houses since 1841. The
population has diminished most of all in St.
James’s, and the houses the most in the City. The
suburban districts, however, such as Chelsea,
Marylebone, St. Pancras, Islington, Hackney,
Shoreditch, Bethnal-green, Stepney, Poplar, Bermondsey,
Newington, Lambeth, Wandsworth,
Camberwell, Greenwich, and Lewisham, have all
increased greatly within the last ten years, both
in dwellings and people. The greatest increase of
the population, as well as houses, has been in
Kensington, where the yearly addition has been
4500 people, and 630 houses.</p>

<p>The more densely-populated districts are, St.
James’s, Westminster, St. Giles’s, the Strand,
Holborn, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, Whitechapel, and
St. George’s-in-the-East, in all of which places there
are upwards of 200 people to the acre, while in
East and West London, in which the population is
the most dense of all, the number of people exceeds
300 to the acre. The least densely populated
districts are Hampstead, Wandsworth, and
Lewisham, where the people are not more than
six, and as few as two to the acre.</p>

<p>The districts in which there are the greatest
number of houses to a given space, are St. James’s,
Westminster, the Strand, Holborn, Clerkenwell,
St. Luke’s, Shoreditch, and St. George’s-in-the-East,
in all of which localities there are upwards of 20
dwellings to each acre of ground, while in East
and West London, which is the most closely built
over of all, the number of houses to each acre
are as many as 32. Hampstead and Lewisham
appear to be the most open districts; for there the
houses are not more than eight and three to every
ten acres of ground.</p>

<p>The localities in which the houses are the
most crowded with inmates are the Strand and
St. Giles’s, where there are more than eleven people
to each house, and St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, and
St. James’s, Westminster, and Holborn, where each
house has on an average ten inmates, while in
Lewisham and Wandsworth the houses are the
least crowded, for there we find only five people
to every house.</p>

<p>Now, comparing this return with that of the
metropolitan police, we have the following results
as to the extent and contents of the Metropolis
<span class="lock">Proper:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>According to Registrar General.</th><th>According to Metropolitan Police.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Area (in statute acres)</td><td>74,070</td><td>58,880</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Parishes</td><td>176</td><td>179</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Population</td><td>2,361,640</td><td>2,111,629</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Hence it will be seen that both the extent and
contents of these two returns differ most materially.</p>

<p>1st. The superficies of the Registrar General’s
metropolis is very nearly 13 square miles, or
15,190 statute acres, greater than the metropolis
of the police commissioners.</p>

<p>2nd. The number of inhabited houses is 2197
more in the one than in the other.</p>

<p>3rd. The population of London, according to
the Registrar General’s limits, is 250,011, or a
quarter of a million, more than it is according to
the limits of the metropolitan police.</p>

<p>It were much to be desired that some more
definite and scientific mode, not only of limiting,
but of dividing the metropolis, were to be adopted.
At present there are, perhaps, as many different
metropolises, so to speak, and as many different
modes of apportioning the several parts of the
whole into districts, as there are public bodies
whose operations are specially confined to the
capital. The Registrar General has, as we have
seen, one metropolis divided into western, northern,
central, eastern, and southern districts. The
metropolitan police commissioners have another
metropolis apportioned into its A divisions, B
divisions, and so forth; and the Post Office has
a third metropolis parcelled out in a totally
different manner; while the London City Mission,
the Scripture Readers, the Ragged Schools, and the
many other similar metropolitan institutions, all
seem to delight in creating a distinct metropolis
for themselves, thus tending to make the statistical
“confusion worse confounded.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Dustmen of London.</span></h3>

<p>Dust and rubbish accumulate in houses from a
variety of causes, but principally from the residuum
of fires, the white ash and cinders, or small fragments
of unconsumed coke, giving rise to by far
the greater quantity. Some notion of the vast
amount of this refuse annually produced in London
may be formed from the fact that the consumption
of coal in the metropolis is, according to
the official returns, 3,500,000 tons per annum,
which is at the rate of a little more than 11
tons per house; the poorer families, it is true, do
not burn more than 2 tons in the course of the
year, but then many such families reside in the
same house, and hence the average will appear in
no way excessive. Now the ashes and cinders
arising from this enormous consumption of coal
would, it is evident, if allowed to lie scattered
about in such a place as London, render, ere long,
not only the back streets, but even the important
thoroughfares, filthy and impassable. Upon
the Officers of the various parishes, therefore, has
devolved the duty of seeing that the refuse of the
fuel consumed throughout London is removed
almost as fast as produced; this they do by entering
into an agreement for the clearance of the “dust-bins”
of the parishioners as often as required,
with some person who possesses all necessary
appliances for the purpose&mdash;such as horses, carts,
baskets, and shovels, together with a plot of
waste ground whereon to deposit the refuse. The
persons with whom this agreement is made are
called “dust-contractors,” and are generally men
of considerable wealth.</p>

<p>The collection of “dust,” is now, more properly
speaking, the removal of it. The collection of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
article implies the voluntary seeking after it, and
this the dustmen can hardly be said to do; for though
they parade the streets shouting for the dust as
they go, they do so rather to fulfil a certain duty
they have undertaken to perform than in any
expectation of profit to be derived from the sale
of the article.</p>

<p>Formerly the custom was otherwise; but then,
as will be seen hereafter, the residuum of the London
fuel was far more valuable. Not many years
ago it was the practice for the various master dustmen
to send in their tenders to the vestry, on a certain
day appointed for the purpose, offering to pay a
considerable sum yearly to the parish authorities
for liberty to collect the dust from the several
houses. The sum formerly paid to the parish
of Shadwell, for instance, though not a very
extensive one, amounted to between 400<i>l.</i> or
500<i>l.</i> per annum; but then there was an immense
demand for the article, and the contractors were
unable to furnish a sufficient supply from London;
ships were frequently freighted with it from other
parts, especially from Newcastle and the northern
ports, and at that time it formed an article of
considerable international commerce&mdash;the price
being from 15<i>s.</i> to 1<i>l.</i> per chaldron. Of late years,
however, the demand has fallen off greatly, while
the supply has been progressively increasing, owing
to the extension of the metropolis, so that the
Contractors have not only declined paying anything
for liberty to collect it, but now stipulate
to receive a certain sum for the removal of it. It
need hardly be stated that the parishes always
employ the man who requires the least money for
the performance of what has now become a
matter of duty rather than an object of desire.
Some idea may be formed of the change which
has taken place in this business, from the fact,
that the aforesaid parish of Shadwell, which formerly
received the sum of 450<i>l.</i> per annum for
liberty to collect the dust, now pays the Contractor
the sum of 240<i>l.</i> per annum for its removal.</p>

<p>The Court of Sewers of the City of London, in
1846, through the advice of Mr. Cochrane, the
president of the National Philanthropic Association,
were able to obtain from the contractors
the sum of 5000<i>l.</i> for liberty to clear away the
dirt from the streets and the dust from the
bins and houses in that district. The year following,
however, the contractors entered into a combination,
and came to a resolution not to bid so
high for the privilege; the result was, that they
obtained their contracts at an expense of 2200<i>l.</i>
By acting on the same principle in the year
after, they not only offered no premium whatever
for the contract, but the City Commissioners
of Sewers were obliged to pay them the
sum of 300<i>l.</i> for removing the refuse, and at present
the amount paid by the City is as much as
4900<i>l.</i>! This is divided among four great contractors,
and would, if equally apportioned, give
them 1250<i>l.</i> each.</p>

<p>I subjoin a list of the names of the principal
contractors and the parishes for which they are

<p>All the metropolitan parishes now pay the
contractors various amounts for the removal of the
dust, and I am credibly informed that there is a
system of underletting and jobbing in the dust
contracts extensively carried on. The contractor
for a certain parish is often a different person from
the master doing the work, who is unknown in
the contract. Occasionally the work would appear
to be subdivided and underlet a second time.</p>

<p>The parish of St. Pancras is split into no
less than 21 districts, each district having a
separate and independent “Board,” who are
generally at war with each other, and make
separate contracts for their several divisions.
This is also the case in other large parishes,
and these and other considerations confirm
me in the conclusion that of large and small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
dust-contractors, job-masters, and middle-men, of
one kind or the other, throughout the metropolis,
there cannot be less than the number I have
stated&mdash;90. With the exception of Bermondsey,
there are no parishes who remove their own dust.</p>

<p>It is difficult to arrive at any absolute statement
as to the gross amount paid by the different
parishes for the removal of the entire dust of the
metropolis. From Shadwell the contractor, as we
have seen, receives 250<i>l.</i>; from the city the four
contractors receive as much as 5000<i>l.</i>; but there
are many small parishes in London which do not
pay above a tithe of the last-mentioned sum. Let
us, therefore, assume, that one with another, the
several metropolitan parishes pay 200<i>l.</i> a year
each to the dust contractor. According to the
returns before given, there are 176 parishes in
London. Hence, the gross amount paid for the
removal of the entire dust of the metropolis will
be between 30,000<i>l.</i> and 40,000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>The removal of the dust throughout the metropolis,
is, therefore, carried on by a number of persons
called Contractors, who undertake, as has been
stated, for a certain sum, to cart away the refuse
from the houses as frequently as the inhabitants
desire it. To ascertain the precise numbers of
these contractors is a task of much greater difficulty
than might at first be conceived.</p>

<p>The London Post Office Directory gives the
following number of tradesmen connected with
the removal of refuse from the houses and streets
of the metropolis.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Dustmen</td><td>9</td></tr>

</table></div>
<p>But these numbers are obviously incomplete, for
even a cursory passenger through London must
have noticed a greater number of names upon the
various dust carts to be met with in the streets
than are here set down.</p>

<p>A dust-contractor, who has been in the business
upwards of 20 years, stated that, from his knowledge
of the trade, he should suppose that at present
there might be about 80 or 90 contractors in
the metropolis. Now, according to the returns
before given, there are within the limits of the
Metropolitan Police District 176 parishes, and
comparing this with my informant’s statement, that
many persons contract for more than one parish
(of which, indeed, he himself is an instance), there
remains but little reason to doubt the correctness
of his supposition&mdash;that there are, in all, between
80 or 90 dust-contractors, large and small,
connected with the metropolis. Assuming the
aggregate number to be 88, there would be one
contractor to every two parishes.</p>

<p>These dust-contractors are likewise the contractors
for the cleansing of the streets, except
where that duty is performed by the Street-Orderlies;
they are also the persons who undertake
the emptying of the cesspools in their neighbourhood;
the latter operation, however, is effected by
an arrangement between themselves and the landlords
of the premises, and forms no part of their
parochial contracts. At the office of the Street
Orderlies in Leicester Square, they have knowledge
of only 30 contractors connected with the
metropolis; but this is evidently defective, and refers
to the “large masters” alone; leaving out of all consideration,
as it does, the host of small contractors
scattered up and down the metropolis, who are able
to employ only two or three carts and six or seven
men each; many of such small contractors being
merely master sweeps who have managed to “get
on a little in the world,” and who are now able to
contract, “in a small way,” for the removal of
dust, street-sweepings, and night-soil. Moreover,
many of even the “great contractors” being unwilling
to venture upon an outlay of capital for
carts, horses, &amp;c., when their contract is only for
a year, and may pass at the end of that time
into the hands of any one who may underbid
them&mdash;many such, I repeat, are in the habit of
underletting a portion of their contract to others
possessing the necessary appliances, or of entering
into partnership with them. The latter is the case
in the parish of Shadwell, where a person having
carts and horses shares the profits with the original
contractor. The agreement made on such occasions
is, of course, a secret, though the practice
is by no means uncommon; indeed, there is
so much secrecy maintained concerning all matters
connected with this business, that the inquiry is
beset with every possible difficulty. The gentleman
who communicated to me the amount paid
by the parish of Shadwell, and who informed me,
moreover, that parishes in his neighbourhood paid
twice and three times more than Shadwell did,
hinted to me the difficulties I should experience at
the commencement of my inquiry, and I have
certainly found his opinion correct to the letter.
I have ascertained that in one yard intimidation
was resorted to, and the men were threatened
with instant dismissal if they gave me any information
but such as was calculated to mislead.</p>

<p>I soon discovered, indeed, that it was impossible
to place any reliance on what some of the contractors
said; and here I may repeat that the indisputable
result of my inquiries has been to meet with far
more deception and equivocation from employers
generally than from the employed; working men
have little or no motive for mis-stating their wages;
they know well that the ordinary rates of remuneration
for their labour are easily ascertainable
from other members of the trade, and seldom or
never object to produce accounts of their earnings,
whenever they have been in the habit of keeping
such things. With employers, however, the case
is far different; to seek to ascertain from them
the profits of their trade is to meet with evasion
and prevarication at every turn; they seem to
feel that their gains are dishonestly large, and
hence resort to every means to prevent them being
made public. That I have met with many honourable
exceptions to this rule, I most cheerfully
acknowledge; but that the <i>majority</i> of tradesmen
are neither so frank, communicative, nor truthful,
as the men in their employ, the whole of my investigations
go to prove. I have already, in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, recorded the character of my
interviews with an eminent Jew slop-tailor, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
army clothier, and an enterprising free-trade stay-maker
(a gentleman who subscribed his 100
guineas to the League), and I must in candour
confess that now, after two years’ experience, I
have found the industrious poor a thousand-fold
more veracious than the trading rich.</p>

<p>With respect to the amount of business done by
these contractors, or gross quantity of dust collected
by them in the course of the year, it would appear
that each employs, on an average, about 20 men,
which makes the number of men employed as dustmen
through the streets of London amount to 1800.
This, as has been previously stated, is grossly at
variance with the number given in the Census of
1841, which computes the dustmen in the metropolis
at only 254. But, as I said before, I have
long ceased to place confidence in the government
returns on such subjects. According to the above
estimate of 254, and deducting from this number
the 88 master-dustmen, there would be only 166
labouring men to empty the 300,000 dustbins of
London, and as these men always work in couples,
it follows that every two dustmen would have to
remove the refuse from about 3600 houses; so
that assuming each bin to require emptying
once every six weeks they would have to cart
away the dust from 2400 houses every month,
or 600 every week, which is at the rate of 100
a day! and as each dust-bin contains about half a
load, it would follow that at this rate each cart
would have to collect 50 loads of dust daily,
whereas 5 loads is the average day’s work.</p>

<p>Computing the London dust-contractors at 90,
and the inhabited houses at 300,000, it follows
that each contractor would have 3333 houses to
remove the refuse from. Now it has been calculated
that the ashes and cinders alone from each
house average about three loads per annum, so
that each contractor would have, in round numbers,
10,000 loads of dust to remove in the course
of the year. I find, from inquiries, that every
two dustmen carry to the yard about five loads a
day, or about 1500 loads in the course of the year,
so that at this rate, there must be between six
and seven carts, and twelve and fourteen collectors
employed by each master. But this is
exclusive of the men employed in the yards.
In one yard that I visited there were fourteen
people busily employed. Six of these were
women, who were occupied in sifting, and they
were attended by three men who shovelled the
dust into their sieves, and the foreman, who was
hard at work loosening and dragging down the
dust from the heap, ready for the “fillers-in.”
Besides these there were two carts and four men
engaged in conveying the sifted dust to the barges
alongside the wharf. At a larger dust-yard, that
formerly stood on the banks of the Regent’s-canal,
I am informed that there were sometimes as
many as 127 people at work. It is but a small
yard, which has not 30 to 40 labourers connected
with it; and the lesser dust-yards have generally
from four to eight sifters, and six or seven
carts. There are, therefore, employed in a medium-sized
yard twelve collectors or cartmen,
six sifters, and three fillers-in, besides the foreman
or forewoman, making altogether 22 persons; so
that, computing the contractors at 90, and allowing
20 men to be employed by each, there would
be 1800 men thus occupied in the metropolis,
which appears to be very near the truth.</p>

<p>One who has been all his life connected with
the business estimated that there must be about
ten dustmen to each metropolitan parish, large and
small. In Marylebone he believed there were
eighteen dust-carts, with two men to each, out
every day; in some small parishes, however, two
men are sufficient. There would be more men
employed, he said, but some masters contracted
for two or three parishes, and so “kept the same
men going,” working them hard, and enlarging
their regular rounds. Calculating, then, that ten
men are employed to each of the 176 metropolitan
parishes, we have 1760 dustmen in London.
The suburban parishes, my informant told me,
were as well “dustmaned” as any he knew;
for the residents in such parts were more particular
about their dust than in busier places.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe how closely the number
of men engaged in the collection of the “dust”
from the coals burnt in London agrees, according
to the above estimate, with the number of men
engaged in delivering the coals to be burnt. The
coal-whippers, who “discharge the colliers,” are
about 1800, and the coal-porters, who carry the
coals from the barges to the merchants’ wagons,
are about the same in number. The amount of
residuum from coal after burning cannot, of course,
be equal either in bulk or weight to the original
substance; but considering that the collection of
the dust is a much slower operation than the delivery
of the coals, the difference is easily accounted
for.</p>

<p>We may arrive, approximately, at the quantity
of dust annually produced in London, in the following
<span class="lock">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The consumption of coal in London, per annum,
is about 3,500,000 tons, exclusive of what is
brought to the metropolis per rail. Coals are
made up of the following component parts, viz.
(1) the inorganic and fixed elements; that is
to say, the ashes, or the bones, as it were, of the
fossil trees, which cannot be burnt; (2) coke, or
the residuary carbon, after being deprived of the
volatile matter; (3) the volatile matter itself
given off during combustion in the form of flame
and smoke.</p>

<p>The relative proportions of these materials in
the various kinds of coals are as follows.&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>Carbon, per cent.</th><th>Volatile, per cent.</th><th>Ashes, per cent.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Cannel or gas coals.</td><td>40 to 60</td><td>60 to 40</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Newcastle or “house” coals.</td><td>57</td><td>37</td><td>5</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Anthracite or “stone” coals.</td><td>80 to 95</td><td>None</td><td>a little.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>In the metropolis the Newcastle coal is chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
used, and this, we perceive, yields five per cent.
ashes and about 57 per cent. carbon. But a considerable
part of the carbon is converted into
carbonic acid during combustion; if, therefore,
we assume that two-thirds of the carbon are
thus consumed, and that the remaining third remains
behind in the form of cinder, we shall
have about 25 per cent. of “dust” from every
ton of coal. On inquiry of those who have
had long experience in this matter, I find that
a ton of coal may be fairly said on an average
to yield about one-fourth its weight in dust;
hence the gross amount of “dust” annually produced
in London would be 900,000 tons, or about
three tons per house per annum.</p>

<p>It is impossible to obtain any definite statistics
on this part of the subject. Not one in every
ten of the contractors keeps any account of
the amount that comes into the “yard.” An
intelligent and communicative gentleman whom I
consulted on this matter, could give me no information
on this subject that was in any way
satisfactory. I have, however, endeavoured to
check the preceding estimate in the following
manner. There are in London upwards of 300,000
inhabited houses, and each house furnishes a
certain quota of dust to the general stock. I have
ascertained that an average-sized house will produce,
in the course of a year, about three cart-loads
of dust, while each cart holds about 40 bushels
(baskets)&mdash;what the dustmen call a chaldron.
There are, of course, many houses in the metropolis
which furnish three and four times this
amount of dust, but against these may be placed
the vast preponderance of small and poor houses
in London and the suburbs, where there is not
one quarter of the quantity produced, owing to
the small amount of fuel consumed. Estimating,
then, the average annual quantity of dust from
each house at three loads, or chaldrons, and the
houses at 300,000, it follows that the gross
quantity collected throughout the metropolis will
be about 900,000 chaldrons per annum.</p>

<p>The next part of the subject is&mdash;what becomes
of this vast quantity of dust&mdash;to what use it is
applied.</p>

<p>The dust thus collected is used for two purposes,
(1) as a manure for land of a peculiar
quality; and (2) for making bricks. The fine
portion of the house-dust called “soil,” and separated
from the “brieze,” or coarser portion, by
sifting, is found to be peculiarly fitted for what
is called breaking up a marshy heathy soil at its
first cultivation, owing not only to the dry nature
of the dust, but to its possessing in an eminent
degree a highly separating quality, almost, if not
quite, equal to sand. In former years the demand
for this finer dust was very great, and barges were
continually in the river waiting their turn to be
loaded with it for some distant part of the country.
At that time the contractors were unable to supply
the demand, and easily got 1<i>l.</i> per chaldron for as
much as they could furnish, and then, as I have
stated, many ships were in the habit of bringing
cargoes of it from the North, and of realizing a
good profit on the transaction. Of late years,
however&mdash;and particularly, I am told, since the
repeal of the corn-laws&mdash;this branch of the business
has dwindled to nothing. The contractors say
that the farmers do not cultivate their land now
as they used; it will not pay them, and instead,
therefore, of bringing fresh land into tillage, and
especially such as requires this sort of manure,
they are laying down that which they previously
had in cultivation, and turning it into pasture
grounds. It is principally on this account, say the
contractors, that we cannot sell the dust we collect
so well or so readily as formerly. There are, however,
some cargoes of the dust still taken, particularly
to the lowlands in the neighbourhood
of Barking, and such other places in the vicinity
of the metropolis as are enabled to realize a
greater profit, by growing for the London markets.
Nevertheless, the contractors are obliged now to
dispose of the dust at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per chaldron, and
sometimes less.</p>

<p>The finer dust is also used to mix with the
clay for making bricks, and barge-loads are continually
shipped off for this purpose. The fine
ashes are added to the clay in the proportion of
one-fifth ashes to four-fifths clay, or 60 chaldrons
to 240 cubic yards, which is sufficient to make
100,000 bricks (where much sand is mixed with
the clay a smaller proportion of ashes may be
used). This quantity requires also the addition
of about 15 chaldrons, or, if mild, of about 12
chaldrons of “brieze,” to aid the burning. The
ashes are made to mix with the clay by collecting
it into a sort of reservoir fitted up for the purpose;
water in great quantities is let in upon
it, and it is then stirred till it resembles a fine
thin paste, in which state the dust easily mingles
with every part of it. In this condition it is left
till the water either soaks into the earth, or goes
off by evaporation, when the bricks are moulded
in the usual manner, the dust forming a component
part of them.</p>

<p>The ashes, or cindered matter, which are thus
dispersed throughout the substance of the clay,
become, in the process of burning, gradually
ignited and consumed. But the “brieze” (from
the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">briser</i>, to break or crush), that is to
say, the coarser portion of the coal-ash, is likewise
used in the burning of the bricks. The
small spaces left among the lowest courses of the
bricks in the kiln, or “clamp,” are filled with
“brieze,” and a thick layer of the same material is
spread on the top of the kilns, when full. Frequently
the “brieze” is mixed with small coals, and
after having been burnt the ashes are collected,
and then mixed with the clay to form new bricks.
The highest price at present given for “brieze”
is 3<i>s.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>The price of the dust used by the brickmakers
has likewise been reduced; this the contractors
account for by saying that there are fewer brick-fields
than formerly near London, as they have
been nearly all built over. They assert, that
while the amount of dust and cinders has increased
proportionately to the increase of the houses, the
demand for the article has decreased in a like
ratio; and that, moreover, the greater portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of the bricks now used in London for the new
buildings come from other quarters. Such dust,
however, as the contractors sell to the brick-makers,
they in general undertake, for a certain
sum, to cart to the brick-fields, though it often
happens that the brick-makers’ carts coming into
town with their loads of bricks to new buildings,
call on their return at the dust-yards, and carry
thence a load of dust or cinders back, and so
save the price of cartage.</p>

<p>But during the operation of sifting the dust,
many things are found which are useless for either
manure or brick-making, such as oyster shells,
old bricks, old boots and shoes, old tin kettles,
old rags and bones, &amp;c. These are used for
various purposes.</p>

<p>The bricks, &amp;c., are sold for sinking beneath
foundations, where a thick layer of concrete is
spread over them. Many old bricks, too, are
used in making new roads, especially where the
land is low and marshy. The old tin goes to
form the japanned fastenings for the corners of
trunks, as well as to other persons, who re-manufacture
it into a variety of articles. The
old shoes are sold to the London shoemakers, who
use them as stuffing between the in-sole and
the outer one; but by far the greater quantity is
sold to the manufacturers of Prussian blue, that
substance being formed out of refuse animal
matter. The rags and bones are of course disposed
of at the usual places&mdash;the marine-store
shops.</p>

<p>A dust-heap, therefore, may be briefly said to
be composed of the following things, which are
severally applied to the following <span class="lock">uses:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. “Soil,” or fine dust, sold to brickmakers
for making bricks, and to farmers for manure, especially
for clover.</p>

<p>2. “Brieze,” or cinders, sold to brickmakers,
for burning bricks.</p>

<p>3. Rags, bones, and old metal, sold to marine-store
dealers.</p>

<p>4. Old tin and iron vessels, sold for “clamps”
to trunks, &amp;c., and for making copperas.</p>

<p>5. Old bricks and oyster shells, sold to builders,
for sinking foundations, and forming roads.</p>

<p>6. Old boots and shoes, sold to Prussian-blue
manufacturers.</p>

<p>7. Money and jewellery, kept, or sold to Jews.</p>

<p>The dust-yards, or places where the dust is
collected and sifted, are generally situated in the
suburbs, and they may be found all round London,
sometimes occupying open spaces adjoining back
streets and lanes, and surrounded by the low
mean houses of the poor; frequently, however,
they cover a large extent of ground in the fields,
and there the dust is piled up to a great height in
a conical heap, and having much the appearance
of a volcanic mountain. The reason why the
dust-heaps are confined principally to the suburbs
is, that more space is to be found in the outskirts
than in a thickly-peopled and central locality.
Moreover, the fear of indictments for nuisance has
had considerable influence in the matter, for it
was not unusual for the yards in former times, to
be located within the boundaries of the city.
They are now, however, scattered round London,
and always placed as near as possible to the
river, or to some canal communicating therewith.
In St. George’s, Shadwell, Ratcliffe,
Limehouse, Poplar, and Blackwall, on the north
side of the Thames, and in Redriffe, Bermondsey,
and Rotherhithe, on the south, they are to be
found near the Thames. The object of this is,
that by far the greater quantity of the soil or
ashes is conveyed in sailing-barges, holding from
70 to 100 tons each, to Feversham, Sittingbourne,
and other places in Kent, which are the
great brick-making manufactories for London.
These barges come up invariably loaded with
bricks, and take home in return a cargo of soil.
Other dust-yards are situated contiguous to the
Regent’s and the Surrey canal; and for the
same reason as above stated&mdash;for the convenience
of water carriage. Moreover, adjoining the Limehouse
cut, which is a branch of the Lea River,
other dust-yards may be found; and again
travelling to the opposite end of the metropolis,
we discover them not only at Paddington on the
banks of the canal, but at Maiden-lane in a
similar position. Some time since there was an
immense dust-heap in the neighbourhood of
Gray’s-inn-lane, which sold for 20,000<i>l.</i>; but that
was in the days when 15<i>s.</i> and 1<i>l.</i> per chaldron
could easily be procured for the dust. According
to the present rate, not a tithe of that amount
could have been realized upon it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>VIEW OF A DUST YARD.</p>

<p>(<i>From a Sketch taken on the spot.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>A visit to any of the large metropolitan dust-yards
is far from uninteresting. Near the centre
of the yard rises the highest heap, composed of
what is called the “soil,” or finer portion of the
dust used for manure. Around this heap are
numerous lesser heaps, consisting of the mixed
dust and rubbish carted in and shot down previous
to sifting. Among these heaps are many women
and old men with sieves made of iron, all busily
engaged in separating the “brieze” from the
“soil.” There is likewise another large heap in some
other part of the yard, composed of the cinders
or “brieze” waiting to be shipped off to the
brickfields. The whole yard seems alive, some
sifting and others shovelling the sifted soil on to
the heap, while every now and then the dust-carts
return to discharge their loads, and proceed
again on their rounds for a fresh supply.
Cocks and hens keep up a continual scratching and
cackling among the heaps, and numerous pigs seem
to find great delight in rooting incessantly about
after the garbage and offal collected from the
houses and markets.</p>

<p>In a dust-yard lately visited the sifters
formed a curious sight; they were almost
up to their middle in dust, ranged in a semi-circle
in front of that part of the heap which
was being “worked;” each had before her a
small mound of soil which had fallen through her
sieve and formed a sort of embankment, behind
which she stood. The appearance of the entire
group at their work was most peculiar. Their
coarse dirty cotton gowns were tucked up behind
them, their arms were bared above their elbows,
their black bonnets crushed and battered like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
those of fish-women; over their gowns they
wore a strong leathern apron, extending from
their necks to the extremities of their petticoats,
while over this, again, was another leathern apron,
shorter, thickly padded, and fastened by a stout
string or strap round the waist. In the process
of their work they pushed the sieve from them
and drew it back again with apparent violence,
striking it against the outer leathern apron with
such force that it produced each time a hollow
sound, like a blow on the tenor drum. All the
women present were middle aged, with the exception
of one who was very old&mdash;68 years of age
she told me&mdash;and had been at the business from
a girl. She was the daughter of a dustman, the
wife, or woman of a dustman, and the mother of
several young dustmen&mdash;sons and grandsons&mdash;all
at work at the dust-yards at the east end of the
metropolis.</p>

<p>We now come to speak of the labourers engaged
in collecting, sifting, or shipping off the dust of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>The dustmen, scavengers, and nightmen are, to
a certain extent, the same people. The contractors
generally agree with the various parishes to
remove both the dust from the houses and the
mud from the streets; the men in their employ
are indiscriminately engaged in these two
diverse occupations, collecting the dust to-day, and
often cleansing the streets on the morrow, and are
designated either dustmen or scavengers, according
to their particular avocation at the moment.
The case is somewhat different, however, with
respect to the nightmen. There is no such thing
as a contract with the parish for removing the
nightsoil. This is done by private agreement
with the landlord of the premises whence the soil
has to be removed. When a cesspool requires
emptying, the occupying tenant communicates with
the landlord, who makes an arrangement with a
dust-contractor or sweep-nightman for this purpose.
This operation is totally distinct from the
regular or daily labour of the dust-contractor’s
men, who receive extra pay for it; sometimes
one set go out at night and sometimes another,
according either to the selection of the master or
the inclination of the men. There are, however,
some dustmen who have never been at work
as nightmen, and could not be induced to do so,
from an invincible antipathy to the employment;
still, such instances are few, for the men generally
go whenever they can, and occasionally engage in
nightwork for employers unconnected with their
masters. It is calculated that there are some hundreds
of men employed nightly in the removal of
the nightsoil of the metropolis during the summer
and autumn, and as these men have often to work
at dust-collecting or cleansing the streets on the
following day, it is evident that the same persons
cannot be thus employed every night; accordingly
the ordinary practice is for the dustmen to “take
it in turns,” thus allowing each set to be employed
every third night, and to have two nights’
rest in the interim.</p>

<p>The men, therefore, who collect the dust on
one day may be cleaning the streets on the next,
especially during wet weather, and engaged at
night, perhaps, twice during the week, in removing
nightsoil; so that it is difficult to arrive
at any precise notion as to the number of persons
engaged in any one of these branches <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>But these labourers not only work indiscriminately
at the collection of dust, the cleansing
of the streets, or the removal of nightsoil, but
they are employed almost as indiscriminately at
the various branches of the dust business; with
this qualification, however, that few men apply
themselves continuously to any one branch of the
business. The labourers employed in a dust-yard
may be divided into two classes: those paid by
the contractor; and those paid by the foreman or
forewoman of the dust-heap, commonly called
hill-man or hill-woman.</p>

<p>They are as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Labourers paid by the Contractors, or</span>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>Yard foreman</i>, or superintendent. This
duty is often performed by the master,
especially in small contracts.</p>

<p>2. <i>Gangers</i> or <i>dust-collectors</i>. These are
called “fillers” and “carriers,” from the
practice of one of the men who go out with
the cart filling the basket, and the other
carrying it on his shoulder to the vehicle.</p>

<p>3. <i>Loaders</i> of carts in the dust-yard for shipment.</p>

<p>4. <i>Carriers</i> of cinders to the cinder-heap, or
bricks to the brick-heap.</p>

<p>5. <i>Foreman</i> or <i>forewoman</i> of the heap.</p></div>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Labourers paid by the hill-man or
hill-woman.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>Sifters</i>, who are generally women, and
mostly the wives or concubines of the
dustmen, but sometimes the wives of badly-paid
labourers.</p>

<p>2. <i>Fillers-in</i>, or shovellers of dust into the
sieves of the sifters (one man being allowed
to every two or three women).</p>

<p>3. <i>Carriers off</i> of bones, rags, metal, and other
perquisites to the various heaps; these are
mostly children of the dustmen.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A medium-sized dust-yard will employ about
twelve collectors, three fillers-in, six sifters, and
one foreman or forewoman; while a large yard
will afford work to about 150 people.</p>

<p>There are four different modes of payment
prevalent among the several labourers employed
at the metropolitan dust-yards:&mdash;(1) by the day;
(2) by the piece or load; (3) by the lump; (4)
by perquisites.</p>

<p>1st. The foreman of the yard, where the master
does not perform this duty himself, is generally
one of the regular dustmen picked out by the
master, for this purpose. He is paid, the sum of
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day, or 15<i>s.</i> per week. In large yards
there are sometimes two and even three yard-foremen
at the same rate of wages. Their duty is
merely to superintend the work. They do not
labour themselves, and their exemption in this
respect is considered, and indeed looked on
by themselves, as a sort of premium for good
services.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dust Hoi! Dust Hoi!</span></p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>2nd. The gangers or collectors are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
paid 8<i>d.</i> per load for every load they bring into
the yard. This is, of course, piece work, for the
more hours the men work the more loads will
they be enabled to bring, and the more pay will
they receive. There are some yards where the
carters get only 6<i>d.</i> per load, as, for instance, at
Paddington. The Paddington men, however, are not
considered inferior workmen to the rest of their
fellows, but merely to be worse paid. In 1826, or
25 years ago, the carters had 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per load; but
at that time the contractors were able to get 1<i>l.</i>
per chaldron for the soil and “brieze” or cinders;
then it began to fall in value, and according to the
decrease in the price of these commodities, so
have the wages of the dust-collectors been reduced.
It will be at once seen that the reduction in the
wages of the dustmen bears no proportion to the
reduction in the price of soil and cinders, but it
must be borne in mind that whereas the contractors
formerly paid large sums for liberty to
collect the dust, they now are paid large sums to
remove it. This in some measure helps to account
for the apparent disproportion, and tends, perhaps,
to equalize the matter. The gangers, therefore,
have 4<i>d.</i> each, per load when best paid. They
consider from four to six loads a good day’s work,
for where the contract is large, extending over
several parishes, they often have to travel a long
way for a load. It thus happens that while the
men employed by the Whitechapel contractor
can, when doing their utmost, manage to bring
only four loads a day to the yard, which is
situated in a place called the “ruins” in Lower
Shadwell, the men employed by the Shadwell
contractor can easily get eight or nine loads in a day.
Five loads are about an average day’s work, and
this gives them 1<i>s.</i> 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> per day each, or 10<i>s.</i>
per week. In addition to this, the men have
their perquisites “in aid of wages.” The collectors
are in the habit of getting beer or money in
lieu thereof, at nearly all the houses from which
they remove the dust, the public being thus in a
manner compelled to make up the rate of wages,
which should be paid by the employer, so that
what is given to benefit the men really goes to
the master, who invariably reduces the wages to
the precise amount of the perquisites obtained.
This is the main evil of the “perquisite system
of payment” (a system of which the mode of
paying waiters may be taken as the special type).
As an instance of the injurious effects of this mode
of payment in connection with the London dustmen,
the collectors are forced, as it were, to extort
from the public that portion of their fair earnings
of which their master deprives them; hence, how can
we wonder that they make it a rule when they receive
neither beer nor money from a house to make as
great a mess as possible the next time they come,
scattering the dust and cinders about in such a
manner, that, sooner than have any trouble with
them, people mostly give them what they look for?
One of the most intelligent men with whom I have
spoken, gave me the following account of his perquisites
for the last week, viz.: Monday, 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>;
Tuesday, 6<i>d.</i>; Wednesday, 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>; Thursday, 7<i>d.</i>;
Friday, 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>; and Saturday, 5<i>d.</i> This he received
in money, and was independent of beer. He had
on the same week drawn rather more than five loads
each day, to the yard, which made his gross earnings
for the week, wages and perquisites together, to be
14<i>s.</i> 0&frac12;<i>d.</i> which he considers to be a fair average
of his weekly earnings as connected with dust.</p>

<p>3rd. The loaders of the carts for shipment are
the same persons as those who collect the dust,
but thus employed for the time being. The pay
for this work is by the “piece” also, 2<i>d.</i> per
chaldron between four persons being the usual
rate, or &frac12;<i>d.</i> per man. The men so engaged
have no perquisites. The barges into which they
shoot the soil or “brieze,” as the case may be,
hold from 50 to 70 chaldrons, and they consider
the loading of one of these barges a good day’s
work. The average cargo is about 60 chaldrons,
which gives them 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day, or somewhat
more than their average earnings when collecting.</p>

<p>4th. The carriers of cinders to the cinder
heap. I have mentioned that, ranged round the
sifters in the dust-yard, are a number of baskets,
into which are put the various things found among
the dust, some of these being the property of the
master, and others the perquisites of the hill man
or woman, as the case may be. The cinders and
old bricks are the property of the master, and to
remove them to their proper heaps boys are employed
by him at 1<i>s.</i> per day. These boys are
almost universally the children of dustmen and
sifters at work in the yard, and thus not only
help to increase the earnings of the family, but
qualify themselves to become the dustmen of a
future day.</p>

<p>5th. The hill-man or hill-woman. The hill-man
enters into an agreement with the contractor
to sift <i>all</i> the dust in the yard throughout the year
at so much per load and perquisites. The usual
sum per load is 6<i>d.</i>, nor have I been able to ascertain
that any of these people undertake to do it at
a less price. Such is the amount paid by the
contractor for Whitechapel. The perquisites of
the hill-man or hill-woman, are rags, bones, pieces
of old metal, old tin or iron vessels, old boots and
shoes, and one-half of the money, jewellery, or other
valuables that may be found by the sifters.</p>

<p>The hill-man or hill-woman employs the following
persons, and pays them at the following rates.</p>

<p>1st. The sifters are paid 1<i>s.</i> per day when
employed, but the employment is not constant.
The work cannot be pursued in wet weather, and
the services of the sifters are required only when
a large heap has accumulated, as they can sift
much faster than the dust can be collected. The
employment is therefore precarious; the payment
has not, for the last 30 years at least, been more
than 1<i>s.</i> per day, but the perquisites were greater.
They formerly were allowed one-half of whatever
was found; of late years, however, the hill-man has
gradually reduced the perquisites “first one thing
and then another,” until the only one they have
now remaining is half of whatever money or other
valuable article may be found in the process of
sifting. These valuables the sifters often pocket,
if able to do so unperceived, but if discovered in the
attempt, they are immediately discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>2nd. “The fillers-in,” or shovellers of dust
into the sieves of sifters, are in general any poor
fellows who may be straggling about in search of
employment. They are sometimes, however, the
grown-up boys of dustmen, not yet permanently
engaged by the contractor. These are paid 2<i>s.</i>
per day for their labour, but they are considered
more as casualty men, though it often happens, if
“hands” are wanted, that they are regularly engaged
by the contractors, and become regular dustmen
for the remainder of their lives.</p>

<p>3rd. The little fellows, the children of the
dustmen, who follow their mothers to the yard,
and help them to pick rags, bones, &amp;c., out of the
sieve and put them into the baskets, as soon as
they are able to carry a basket between two of
them to the separate heaps, are paid 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i>
per day for this work by the hill-man.</p>

<p>The wages of the dustmen have been increased
within the last seven years from 6<i>d.</i> per load to
8<i>d.</i> among the large contractors&mdash;the “small
masters,” however, still continue to pay 6<i>d.</i> per
load. This increase in the rate of remuneration
was owing to the men complaining to the commissioners
that they were not able to live upon
what they earned at 6<i>d.</i>; an enquiry was made
into the truth of the men’s assertion, and the result
was that the commissioners decided upon letting
the contracts to such parties only as would undertake
to pay a fair price to their workmen. The
contractors, accordingly, increased the remuneration
of the labourers; since then the principal masters
have paid 8<i>d.</i> per load to the collectors. It is
right I should add, that I could not hear&mdash;though
I made special enquiries on the subject&mdash;that the
wages had been in any one instance reduced since
Free-trade has come into operation.</p>

<p>The usual hours of labour vary according to
the mode of payment. The “collectors,” or men
out with the cart, being paid by the load, work
as long as the light lasts; the “fillers-in” and
sifters, on the other hand, being paid by the day,
work the ordinary hours, viz., from six to six,
with the regular intervals for meals.</p>

<p>The summer is the worst time for all hands, for
then the dust decreases in quantity; the collectors,
however, make up for the “slackness” at this
period by nightwork, and, being paid by the
“piece” or load at the dust business, are not discharged
when their employment is less brisk.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the dustmen who perambulate
the streets usually collect five loads in a
day; this, at 8<i>d.</i> per load, leaves them about
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> each, and so makes their weekly earnings
amount to about 10<i>s.</i> per week. Moreover,
there are the “perquisites” from the houses
whence they remove the dust; and further,
the dust-collectors are frequently employed at
the night-work, which is always a distinct matter
from the dust-collecting, &amp;c., and paid for
independent of their regular weekly wages, so
that, from all I can gather, the average wages of
the men appear to be rather more than 15<i>s.</i>
Some admitted to me, that in busy times they
often earned 25<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>Then, again, dustwork, as with the weaving of
silk, is a kind of family work. The husband,
wife, and children (unfortunately) all work at it.
The consequence is, that the earnings of the whole
have to be added together in order to arrive at
a notion of the aggregate gains.</p>

<p>The following may therefore be taken as a fair
average of the earnings of a dustman and his
family <i>when in full employment</i>. The elder boys
when able to earn 1<i>s.</i> a day set up for themselves,
and do not allow their wages to go into
the common purse.</p>

<p>These are the earnings, it should be borne in
mind, of a family in full employment. Perhaps
it may be fairly said that the earnings of the
single men are, on an average, 15<i>s.</i> a week, and
1<i>l.</i> for the family men all the year round.</p>

<p>Now, when we remember that the wages of
many agricultural labourers are but 8<i>s.</i> a week,
and the earnings of many needlewomen not 6<i>d.</i> a
day, it must be confessed that the remuneration
of the dustmen, and even of the dustwomen, is
<i>comparatively</i> high. This certainly is not due
to what Adam Smith, in his chapter on the
Difference of Wages, terms the “disagreeableness
of the employment.” “The wages of labour,”
he says, “vary with the ease or hardship,
the cleanliness or dirtiness, the honourableness
or dishonourableness, of the employment.” It
will be seen&mdash;when we come to treat of
the nightmen&mdash;that the most offensive, and perhaps
the least honourable, of all trades, is far from
ranking among the best paid, as it should, if the
above principle held good. That the disagreeableness
of the occupation may in a measure tend to
decrease the competition among the labourers,
there cannot be the least doubt, but that it will
consequently induce, as political economy would
have us believe, a larger amount of wages to accrue
to each of the labourers, is certainly another of
the many assertions of that science which must
be pronounced “not proven.” For the dustmen
are paid, if anything, less, and certainly not more,
than the usual rate of payment to the London
labourers; and if the earnings rank high, as
times go, it is because all the members of the
family, from the very earliest age, are able to
work at the business, and so add to the general
gains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The dustmen are, generally speaking, an hereditary
race; when children they are reared in
the dust-yard, and are habituated to the work
gradually as they grow up, after which, almost as
a natural consequence, they follow the business
for the remainder of their lives. These may
be said to be born-and-bred dustmen. The numbers
of the regular men are, however, from time
to time recruited from the ranks of the many ill-paid
labourers with which London abounds.
When hands are wanted for any special occasion
an employer has only to go to any of the dock-gates,
to find at all times hundreds of starving
wretches anxiously watching for the chance of
getting something to do, even at the rate of 4<i>d.</i>
per hour. As the operation of emptying a dust-bin
requires only the ability to handle a shovel,
which every labouring man can manage, all workmen,
however unskilled, can at once engage in
the occupation; and it often happens that the
men thus casually employed remain at the calling
for the remainder of their lives. There are no
houses of call whence the men are taken on
when wanting work. There are certainly public-houses,
which are denominated houses of call, in
the neighbourhood of every dust-yard, but these
are merely the drinking shops of the men, whither
they resort of an evening after the labour of the
day is accomplished, and whence they are furnished
in the course of the afternoon with beer;
but such houses cannot be said to constitute the
dustman’s “labour-market,” as in the tailoring
and other trades, they being never resorted to
as hiring-places, but rather used by the men only
when hired. If a master have not enough
“hands” he usually inquires among his men, who
mostly know some who&mdash;owing, perhaps, to the
failure of their previous master in getting his
usual contract&mdash;are only casually employed at
other places. Such men are immediately engaged
in preference to others; but if these cannot
be found, the contractors at once have recourse to
the system already stated.</p>

<p>The manner in which the dust is collected is very
simple. The “filler” and the “carrier” perambulate
the streets with a heavily-built high box cart, which
is mostly coated with a thick crust of filth, and drawn
by a clumsy-looking horse. These men used, before
the passing of the late Street Act, to ring a dull-sounding
bell so as to give notice to housekeepers
of their approach, but now they merely cry, in a
hoarse unmusical voice, “Dust oy-eh!” Two men
accompany the cart, which is furnished with a short
ladder and two shovels and baskets. These baskets
one of the men fills from the dust-bin, and then
helps them alternately, as fast as they are filled,
upon the shoulder of the other man, who carries
them one by one to the cart, which is placed immediately
alongside the pavement in front of the
house where they are at work. The carrier
mounts up the side of the cart by means of the
ladder, discharges into it the contents of the
basket on his shoulder, and then returns below
for the other basket which his mate has filled for
him in the interim. This process is pursued till
all is cleared away, and repeated at different houses
till the cart is fully loaded; then the men make
the best of their way to the dust-yard, where
they shoot the contents of the cart on to the
heap, and again proceed on their regular rounds.</p>

<p>The dustmen, in their appearance, very much
resemble the waggoners of the coal-merchants.
They generally wear knee-breeches, with ancle
boots or gaiters, short dirty smockfrocks or coarse
gray jackets, and fantail hats. In one particular,
however, they are at first sight distinguishable
from the coal-merchants’ men, for the latter are
invariably black from coal dust, while the dustmen,
on the contrary, are gray with ashes.</p>

<p>In their personal appearance the dustmen are
mostly tall stalwart fellows; there is nothing sickly-looking
about them, and yet a considerable part
of their time is passed in the yards and in the
midst of effluvia most offensive, and, if we believe
“zymotic theorists,” as unhealthy to those unaccustomed
to them; nevertheless, the children, who
may be said to be reared in the yard and to have
inhaled the stench of the dust-heap with their
first breath, are healthy and strong. It is said,
moreover, that during the plague in London the
dustmen were the persons who carted away the
dead, and it remains a tradition among the class
to the present day, that not one of them died of
the plague, even during its greatest ravages. In
Paris, too, it is well known, that, during the cholera
of 1849, the quarter of Belleville, where
the night-soil and refuse of the city is deposited,
escaped the freest from the pestilence; and in
London the dustmen boast that, during both the
recent visitations of the cholera, they were altogether
exempt from the disease. “Look at that
fellow, sir!” said one of the dust-contractors to
me, pointing to his son, who was a stout red-cheeked
young man of about twenty. “Do you
see anything ailing about him? Well, he has been
in the yard since he was born. There stands
my house just at the gate, so you see he hadn’t
far to travel, and when quite a child he used to
play and root away here among the dust all his
time. I don’t think he ever had a day’s illness
in his life. The people about the yard are all
used to the smell and don’t complain about it.
It’s all stuff and nonsense, all this talk about
dust-yards being unhealthy. I’ve never done
anything else all my days and I don’t think I
look very ill. I shouldn’t wonder now but what
I’d be set down as being fresh from the sea-side
by those very fellows that write all this trash about
a matter that they don’t know just <i>that</i> about;” and
he snapped his fingers contemptuously in the air,
and, thrusting both hands into his breeches pockets,
strutted about, apparently satisfied that he had the
best of the argument. He was, in fact, a stout,
jolly, red-faced man. Indeed, the dustmen, as
a class, appear to be healthy, strong men, and
extraordinary instances of longevity are common
among them. I heard of one dustman who lived
to be 115 years; another, named Wood, died at
100; and the well-known Richard Tyrrell died
only a short time back at the advanced age of 97.
The misfortune is, that we have no large series of
facts on this subject, so that the longevity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
health of the dustmen might be compared with
those of other classes.</p>

<p>In almost all their habits the Dustmen are
similar to the Costermongers, with the exception
that they seem to want their cunning and natural
quickness, and that they have little or no predilection
for gaming. Costermongers, however,
are essentially traders, and all trade is a species
of gambling&mdash;the risking of a certain sum of money
to obtain more; hence spring, perhaps, the gambling
propensities of low traders, such as costers,
and Jew clothes-men; and hence, too, that natural
sharpness which characterizes the same classes.
The dustmen, on the contrary, have regular employment
and something like regular wages, and
therefore rest content with what they can earn in
their usual way of business.</p>

<p>Very few of them understand cards, and I could
not learn that they ever play at “pitch and toss.”
I remarked, however, a number of parallel lines
such as are used for playing “shove halfpenny,”
on a deal table in the tap-room frequented by
them. The great amusement of their evenings
seems to be, to smoke as many pipes of tobacco
and drink as many pots of beer as possible.</p>

<p>I believe it will be found that all persons in the
habit of driving horses, such as cabmen, ’busmen,
stage-coach drivers, &amp;c., are peculiarly partial to intoxicating
drinks. The cause of this I leave
others to determine, merely observing that there
would seem to be two reasons for it: the first is,
their frequent stopping at public-houses to water or
change their horses, so that the idea of drinking
is repeatedly suggested to their minds even if the
practice be not <i>expected</i> of them; while the second
reason is, that being out continually in the wet,
they resort to stimulating liquors as a preventive to
“colds” until at length a habit of drinking is
formed. Moreover, from the mere fact of passing
continually through the air, they are enabled to
drink a greater quantity with comparative impunity.
Be the cause, however, what it may, the
dustmen spend a large proportion of their earnings
in drink. There is always some public-house in
the neighbourhood of the dust-yard, where they
obtain credit from one week to another, and
here they may be found every night from the
moment their work is done, drinking, and
smoking their long pipes&mdash;their principal amusement
consisting in “chaffing” each other. This
“chaffing” consists of a species of scurrilous jokes
supposed to be given and taken in good part, and
the noise and uproar occasioned thereby increases
as the night advances, and as the men get heated
with liquor. Sometimes the joking ends in a
general quarrel; the next morning, however, they
are all as good friends as ever, and mutually agree
in laying the blame on the “cussed drink.”</p>

<p>One-half, at least, of the dustmen’s earnings, is,
I am assured, expended in drink, both man and
woman assisting in squandering their money in this
way. They usually live in rooms for which they
pay from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per week rent, three or four
dust-men and their wives frequently lodging in the
same house. These rooms are cheerless-looking,
and almost unfurnished&mdash;and are always situate
in some low street or lane not far from the dust-yard.
The men have rarely any clothes but those
in which they work. For their breakfast the dustmen
on their rounds mostly go to some cheap coffee-house,
where they get a pint or half-pint of coffee,
taking their bread with them as a matter of economy.
Their midday meal is taken in the public-house,
and is almost always bread and cheese and
beer, or else a saveloy or a piece of fat pork or
bacon, and at night they mostly “wind up” by
deep potations at their favourite house of call.</p>

<p>There are many dustmen now advanced in years
born and reared at the East-end of London, who
have never in the whole course of their lives been
as far west as Temple-bar, who know nothing
whatever of the affairs of the country, and who
have never attended a place of worship. As an
instance of the extreme ignorance of these people,
I may mention that I was furnished by one of the
contractors with the address of a dustman whom
his master considered to be one of the most intelligent
men in his employ. Being desirous of
hearing his statement from his own lips I sent for
the man, and after some conversation with him
was proceeding to note down what he said, when
the moment I opened my note-book and took the
pencil in my hand, he started up, exclaiming,&mdash;“No,
no! I’ll have none of that there work&mdash;I’m
not such a <span class="lock">b&mdash;&mdash;</span> fool as you takes me to be&mdash;I
doesn’t understand it, I tells you, and I’ll
not have it, now that’s plain;”&mdash;and so saying
he ran out of the room, and descended the entire
flight of stairs in two jumps. I followed him to
explain, but unfortunately the pencil was still in
one hand and the book in the other, and immediately
I made my appearance at the door he
took to his heels, again with three others who
seemed to be waiting for him there. One of the
most difficult points in my labours is to make such
men as these comprehend the object or use of my
investigations.</p>

<p>Among 20 men whom I met in one yard, there
were only five who could read, and only two out
of that five could write, even imperfectly. These
two are looked up to by their companions as prodigies
of learning and are listened to as oracles,
on all occasions, being believed to understand
every subject thoroughly. It need hardly be
added, however, that their acquirements are of
the most meagre character.</p>

<p>The dustmen are very partial to a song, and
always prefer one of the doggrel street ballads,
with what they call a “jolly chorus” in which,
during their festivities, they all join with stentorian
voices. At the conclusion there is usually
a loud stamping of feet and rattling of quart pots
on the table, expressive of their approbation.</p>

<p>The dustmen never frequent the twopenny
hops, but sometimes make up a party for the
“theaytre.” They generally go in a body with
their wives, if married, and their “gals,” if single.
They are always to be found in the gallery, and
greatly enjoy the melodramas performed at the second-class
minor theatres, especially if there be
plenty of murdering scenes in them. The Garrick,
previous to its being burnt, was a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
resort of the East-end dustmen. Since that period
they have patronized the Pavilion and the City
of London.</p>

<p>The politics of the dustmen are on a par with
their literary attainments&mdash;they cannot be said
to have any. I cannot say that they are
Chartists, for they have no very clear knowledge
of what “the charter” requires. They
certainly have a confused notion that it is something
against the Government, and that the
enactment of it would make them all right; but
as to the nature of the benefits which it would
confer upon them, or in what manner it would be
likely to operate upon their interest, they have
not, as a body, the slightest idea. They have
a deep-rooted antipathy to the police, the magistrates,
and all connected with the administration
of justice, looking upon them as their natural
enemies. They associate with none but themselves;
and in the public-houses where they
resort there is a room set apart for the special
use of the “dusties,” as they are called, where no
others are allowed to intrude, except introduced
by one of themselves, or at the special desire of
the majority of the party, and on such occasions
the stranger is treated with great respect and
consideration.</p>

<p>As to the morals of these people, it may easily
be supposed that they are not of an over-strict
character. One of the contractors said to me,
“I’d just trust one of them as far as I could
fling a bull by the tail; <i>but then</i>,” he added,
with a callousness that proved the laxity of
discipline among the men was due more to his
neglect of his duty to them than from any
special perversity on their parts, “<i>that’s
none of my business; they do my work, and
that’s all I want with them, and all I care
about</i>. You see they’re not like other people,
they’re reared to it. Their fathers before them
were dustmen, and when lads they go into the
yard as sifters, and when they grow up
they take to the shovel, and go out with the
carts. They learn all they know in the dust-yards,
and you may judge from that what their
learning is likely to be. If they find anything
among the dust you may be sure that neither
you nor I will ever hear anything about it;
ignorant as they are, they know a little too much
for that. They know, as well as here and there
one, where the dolly-shop is; <i>but, as I said
before, that’s none of my business. Let every one
look out for themselves, as I do, and then they
need not care for any one</i>.” [With such masters
professing such principles&mdash;though it should be
stated that the sentiments expressed on this occasion
are but similar to what I hear from the
lower class of traders every day&mdash;how can it be
expected that these poor fellows can be above the
level of the mere beasts of burden that they
use.] “As to their women,” continued the
master, “I don’t trouble my head about such
things. I believe the dustmen are as good to them as
other men; and I’m sure their wives would be as
good as other women, if they only had the chance
of the best. But you see they’re all such fellows
for drink that they spend most of their money
that way, and then starve the poor women, and
knock them about at a shocking rate, so that
they have the life of dogs, or worse. I don’t
wonder at anything they do. Yes, they’re
all married, as far as I know; that is, they live
together as man and wife, though they’re not
very particular, certainly, about the ceremony.
The fact is, a regular dustman don’t understand
much about such matters, and, I believe, don’t
care much, either.”</p>

<p>From all I could learn on this subject, it would
appear that, for one dustman that is married, 20
live with women, but remain constant to them;
indeed, both men and women abide faithfully by
each other, and for this reason&mdash;the woman earns
nearly half as much as the man. If the men
and women were careful and prudent, they might,
I am assured, live well and comfortable; but by far
the greater portion of the earnings of both go to
the publican, for I am informed, on competent
authority, that a dustman will not think of sitting
down for a spree without his woman. The children,
as soon as they are able to go into the yard, help
their mothers in picking out the rags, bones, &amp;c.,
from the sieve, and in putting them in the basket.
They are never sent to school, and as soon as they
are sufficiently strong are mostly employed in some
capacity or other by the contractor, and in due
time become dustmen themselves. Some of the
children, in the neighbourhood of the river, are
mud-larks, and others are bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers,
on a small scale; neglected and thrown
on their own resources at an early age, without
any but the most depraved to guide them, it is no
wonder to find that many of them turn thieves. To
this state of the case there are, however, some few
exceptions.</p>

<p>Some of the dustmen are prudent well-behaved
men and have decent homes; many of this class
have been agricultural labourers, who by distress,
or from some other cause, have found their way to
London. This was the case with one whom I
talked with: he had been a labourer in Essex,
employed by a farmer named Izzod, whom he
spoke of as being a kind good man. Mr. Izzod
had a large farm on the Earl of Mornington’s
estate, and after he had sunk his capital in the
improvement of the land, and was about to
reap the fruits of his labour and his money, the
farmer was ejected at a moment’s notice, beggared
and broken-hearted. This occurred near Roydon,
in Essex. The labourer, finding it difficult to obtain
work in the country, came to London, and, discovering
a cousin of his engaged in a dust-yard, got
employed through him at the same place, where
he remains to the present day. This man was
well clothed, he had good strong lace boots, gray
worsted stockings, a stout pair of corduroy breeches,
a short smockfrock and fantail. He has kept
himself aloof, I am told, from the drunkenness and
dissipation of the dustmen. He says that many
of the new hands that get to dustwork are mechanics
or people who have been “better off,” and
that these get thinking about what they have been,
till to drown their care they take to drinking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
often become, in the course of a year or so, worse
than the “old hands” who have been reared to
the business and have “nothing at all to think
about.”</p>

<p>Among the dustmen there is no “Society” nor
“Benefit Club,” specially devoted to the class&mdash;no
provident institution whence they can obtain
“relief” in the event of sickness or accident.
The consequence is that, when ill or injured, they
are obliged to obtain letters of admission to some
of the hospitals, and there remain till cured. In
cases of total incapacity for labour, their invariable
refuge is the workhouse; indeed they look
forward (whenever they foresee at all) to this
asylum as their resting-place in old age, with the
greatest equanimity, and talk of it as “the house”
par excellence, or as “the big house,” “the great
house,” or “the old house.” There are, however,
scattered about in every part of London numerous
benefit clubs made up of working-men of every
description, such as Old Friends, Odd Fellows,
Foresters, and Birmingham societies, and with
some one or other of these the better class of
dustmen are connected. The general rule, however,
is, that the men engaged in this trade belong
to no benefit club whatever, and that in
the season of their adversity they are utterly
unprovided for, and consequently become burdens
to the parishes wherein they happen to reside.</p>

<p>I visited a large dust-yard at the east end of
London, for the purpose of getting a statement
from one of the men. My informant was, at the
time of my visit, shovelling the sifted soil from
one of the lesser heaps, and, by a great effort of
strength and activity, pitching each shovel-full to
the top of a lofty mound, somewhat resembling a
pyramid. Opposite to him stood a little woman,
stoutly made, and with her arms bare above the
elbow; she was his partner in the work, and was
pitching shovel-full for shovel-full with him to the
summit of the heap. She wore an old soiled
cotton gown, open in front, and tucked up behind
in the fashion of the last century. She had
clouts of old rags tied round her ancles to prevent
the dust from getting into her shoes, a sort of
coarse towel fastened in front for an apron, and a
red handkerchief bound tightly round her head.
In this trim she worked away, and not only kept
pace with the man, but often threw two shovels
for his one, although he was a tall, powerful
fellow. She smiled when she saw me noticing
her, and seemed to continue her work with greater
assiduity. I learned that she was deaf, and spoke
so indistinctly that no stranger could understand
her. She had also a defect in her sight, which
latter circumstance had compelled her to abandon
the sifting, as she could not well distinguish the
various articles found in the dust-heap. The poor
creature had therefore taken to the shovel, and now
works with it every day, doing the labour of the
strongest men.</p>

<p>From the man above referred to I obtained the
following statement:&mdash;“Father vos a dustie;&mdash;vos
at it all his life, and grandfather afore him for
I can’t tell how long. Father vos allus a rum ’un;&mdash;sich
a beggar for lush. Vhy I’m blowed if he
vouldn’t lush as much as half-a-dozen on ’em can
lush now; somehow the dusties hasn’t got the
stuff in ’em as they used to have. A few year
ago the fellers ’u’d think nothink o’ lushin avay
for five or six days without niver going anigh their

Jack can read, but he can do it stunning; he’s

patter to you as long as he likes.”</p>

<p>Concerning the capital and income of the London
dust business, the following estimate may be
given as to the amount of property invested in
and accruing to the trade.</p>

<p>It has been computed that there are 90 contractors,
large and small; of these upwards of two-thirds,
or about 35, may be said to be in a considerable
way of business, possessing many carts
and horses, as well as employing a large body of
people; some yards have as many as 150 hands
connected with them. The remaining 55 masters
are composed of “small men,” some of whom are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
known as “running dustmen,” that is to say, persons
who collect the dust without any sanction
from the parish; but the number belonging to this
class has considerably diminished since the great
deterioration in the price of “brieze.” Assuming,
then, that the great and little master dustmen
employ on an average between six and seven carts
each, we have the following statement as to the</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Capital of the London Dust Trade.</span></h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td></td><td class="left">Being a total capital of</td><td class="total">£28,590</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If, therefore, we assert that the capital of this
trade is between 25,000<i>l.</i> and 30,000<i>l.</i> in value,
we shall not be far wrong either way.</p>

<p>Of the annual income of the same trade, it is
almost impossible to arrive at any positive results;
but, in the absence of all authentic information on
the subject, we may make the subjoined conjecture.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Income of the London Dust Trade.</span></h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Sum paid to contractors for the removal of dust from the 176 metropolitan parishes, at 200<i>l.</i> each parish</td><td>£35,200</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Thus it would appear that the total income of
the dust trade may be taken at between 145,000<i>l.</i>
and 150,000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>Against this we have to set the yearly out-goings
of the business, which may be roughly
estimated as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<tr><td></td><td class="total">£75,400</td></tr>

<p>The above estimates give us the following aggregate
<span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Total yearly incomings of the London dust trade</td><td>£147,700</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total yearly out-goings</td><td>75,400</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total yearly profit</td><td class="total">£72,300</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence it would appear that the profits of the
dust-contractors are very nearly at the rate of
100<i>l.</i> per cent. on their expenditure. I do not
think I have over estimated the incomings, or
under estimated the out-goings; at least I have
striven to avoid doing so, in order that no injustice
might be done to the members of the
trade.</p>

<p>This aggregate profit, when divided among the
90 contractors, will make the clear gains of each
master dustman amount to about 800<i>l.</i> per annum:
of course some derive considerably more than this
amount, and some considerably less.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the London Sewerage and Scavengery.</span></h3>

<p>The subject I have now to treat&mdash;principally as
regards street-labour, but generally in its sanitary,
social, and economical bearings&mdash;may really be
termed vast. It is of the cleansing of a capital city,
with its thousands of miles of streets and roads
<i>on</i> the surface, and its thousands of miles of
sewers and drains <i>under</i> the surface of the earth.
And first let me deal with the subject in a historical
point of view.</p>

<p>Public scavengery or street-cleansing, from the
earliest periods of our history, since municipal
authority regulated the internal economy of our
cities, has been an object of some attention. In
the records of all our civic corporations may be
found bye-laws, or some equivalent measure, to
enforce the cleansing of the streets. But these
regulations were little enforced. It was ordered
that the streets should be swept, but often enough
men were not employed by the authorities to
sweep them; until after the great fire of London,
and in many parts for years after that, the tradesman’s
apprentice swept the dirt from the front of
his master’s house, and left it in the street, to be
removed at the leisure of the scavenger. This
was in the streets most famous for the wealth
and commercial energy of the inhabitants. The
streets inhabited by the poor, until about the
beginning of the present century, were rarely
swept at all. The unevenness of the pavement,
the accumulation of wet and mud in rainy
weather, the want of foot-paths, and sometimes
even of grates and kennels, made Cowper, in one
of his letters, describe a perambulation of some of
these streets as “going by water.”</p>

<p>Even this state of things was, however, an
improvement. In the accounts of the London
street-broils and fights, from the reign of Henry
III., more especially during the war of the
Roses, down to the civil war which terminated
in the beheading of Charles I., mention is more
or less made of the combatants having availed
themselves of the shelter of the rubbish in the
streets. These mounds of rubbish were then
kinds of street-barricades, opposing the progress
of passengers, like the piles of overturned omnibuses
and other vehicles of the modern French
street-combatants. There is no doubt that in the
older times these mounds were composed, first,
of the earth dug out for the foundation of some
building, or the sinking of some well, or (later
on) the formation of some drain; for these works
were often long in hand, not only from the interruptions
of civil strife and from want of funds,
but from indifference, owing to the long delay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
their completion, and were often altogether abandoned.
After dusk the streets of the capital of
England could not be traversed without lanterns
or torches. This was the case until the last
40 or 50 years in nearly all the smaller towns of
England, but there the darkness was the principal
obstacle; in the inferior parts of “Old
London,” however, there were the additional inconveniences
of broken limbs and robbery.</p>

<p>It would be easy to adduce instances from the
olden writers in proof of all the above statements,
but it seems idle to cite proofs of what is known
to all.</p>

<p>The care of the streets, however, as regards
the removal of the dirt, or, as the weather might
be, the dust and mud, seems never to have been
much of a national consideration. It was left to
the corporations and the parishes. Each of these
had its own especial arrangements for the collection
and removal of dirt in its own streets; and
as each parochial or municipal system generally
differed in some respect or other, taken as a
whole, there was no one general mode or system
adopted. To all this the street-management of
our own days, in the respect of scavengery, and,
as I shall show, of sewerage, presents a decided
improvement. This improvement in street-management
is not attributable to any public agitation&mdash;to
any public, and, far less, national manifestation
of feeling. It was debated sometimes
in courts of Common Council, in ward and
parochial meetings, but the public generally seem
to have taken no express interest in the matter.
The improvement seems to have established itself
gradually from the improved tastes and habits of
the people.</p>

<p>Although <i>generally</i> left to the local powers, the
subject of street-cleansing and management, however,
has not been <i>entirely</i> overlooked by Parliament.
Among parliamentary enactments is the
measure best known as “Michael Angelo Taylor’s
Act,” passed early in the present century, which
requires all householders every morning to remove
from the front of their premises any snow
which may have fallen during the night, &amp;c., &amp;c.;
the late Police Acts also embrace subordinately
the subject of street-management.</p>

<p>On the other hand the sewers have long been
the object of national care. “The daily great
damages and losses which have happened in many
and divers parts of this realm” (I give the spirit
of the preamble of several Acts of Parliament),
“as well by the reason of the outrageous flowings,
surges, and course of the river in and upon
the marsh grounds and other low places, heretofore
through public wisdom won and made profitable
for the great commonwealth of this realm,
as also by occasion of land waters and other outrageous
springs in and upon meadows, pastures,
and other low grounds adjoining to rivers, floods,
and other water-courses,” caused parliamentary
attention to be given to the subject.</p>

<p>Until towards the latter part of the last century,
however, the streets even of the better order
were often flooded during heavy and continuous
rains, owing to the sewers and drains having
been choked, so that the sewage forced its way
through the gratings into the streets and yards,
flooding all the underground apartments and
often the ground floors of the houses, as well as
the public thoroughfares with filth.</p>

<p>It is not many months since the neighbourhood
of so modern a locality as Waterloo-bridge
was flooded in this manner, and boats were
used in the Belvidere and York-roads. On the
1st of August, 1846, after a tremendous storm of
thunder, hail, and rain, miles of the capital were
literally under water; hundreds of publicans’
beer-cellars contained far more water than beer,
and the damage done was enormous. These facts
show that though much has been accomplished
towards the efficient sewerage of the metropolis,
much remains to be accomplished still.</p>

<p>The first statute on the subject of the public
sewerage was as early as the 9th year of the
reign of Henry III. There were enactments, also,
in most of the succeeding reigns, but they were
all partial and conflicting, and related more to
local desiderata than to any system of sewerage
for the public benefit, until the reign of Henry
VIII., when the “Bill of Sewers” was passed
(in 1531). This act provided for a more general
system of sewerage in the cities and towns of the
kingdom, requiring the main channels to be of
certain depths and dimensions, according to the
localities, situation, &amp;c. In many parts of the
country the sewerage is still carried on according
to the provisions in the act of Henry VIII., but
those provisions were modified, altered, or “explained,”
by many subsequent statutes.</p>

<p>Any uniformity which might have arisen from
the observance of the same principles of sewerage
was effectually checked by the measures adopted
in London, more especially during the last 100
years. As the metropolis increased new sewerage
became necessary, and new local bodies were
formed for its management. These were known
as the Commissions of Sewers, and the members
of those bodies acted independently one of another,
under the authority of their own Acts of Parliament,
each having its own board, engineers, clerks,
officers, and workmen. Each commission was confined
to its own district, and did what was accounted
best for its own district with little regard to any
general plan of sewerage, so that London was, and
in a great measure is, sewered upon different
principles, as to the size of the sewers and drains,
the rates of inclination, &amp;c. &amp;c. In 1847 there
were eight of these districts and bodies: the City
of London, the Tower Hamlets, Saint Katherine’s,
Poplar and Blackwall, Holborn and Finsbury,
Westminster and part of Middlesex, Surrey and
Kent, and Greenwich. In 1848 these several
bodies were concentrated by act of parliament,
and entitled the “Metropolitan Commission of
Sewers;” but the City of London, as appears to
be the case with every parliamentary measure
affecting the metropolis, presents an exception, as
it retains a separate jurisdiction, and is not under
the control of the general commissioners, to whom
parliament has given authority over such matters.</p>

<p>The management of the metropolitan scaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>gery
and sewerage, therefore, differs in this respect.
The scavengery is committed to the care of the
several parishes, each making its own contract;
the sewerage is consigned by Parliament to a
body of commissioners. In both instances, however,
the expenses are paid out of local rates.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to treat of each of these
subjects separately, beginning with the cleansing
of the streets.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap"><a id="Of_the_Streets_of_London"></a>Of the Streets of London.</span></h2>

</div>
<p>There are now three modes of pavement in the
streets of the metropolis.</p>

<p>1. <i>The stone pavement</i> (commonly composed
of Aberdeen granite).</p>

<p>2. <i>The macadamized pavement</i>, or rather <i>road</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>The wood pavement.</i></p>

<p>The stone pavement has generally, in the several
towns of England, been composed of whatever
material the quarries or rocks of the neighbourhood
supplied, limestone being often thus
used. In some places, where there were no
quarries available, the stones of a river or rivulet-side
were used, but these were rounded and
slippery, and often formed but a rugged pathway.
For London pavement, the neighbourhood not
being rich in stone quarries, granite has usually
been brought by water from Scotland, and a small
quantity from Guernsey for the pavement of the
streets. The stone pavement is made by the
placing of the granite stones, hewn and shaped
ready for the purpose, side by side, with a foundation
of concrete. The concrete now used for
the London street-pavement is Thames ballast,
composed of shingles, or small stones, and mixed
with lime, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Macadamization was not introduced into the
<i>streets</i> of London until about 25 years ago.
Before that, it had been carried to what was
accounted a great degree of perfection on many of
the principal mail and coach roads. Some 50
miles on the Great North Road, or that between
London and Carlisle, were often pointed out as an
admirable specimen of road-making on Mac Adam’s
principles. This road was well known in the old
coaching days as Leming-lane, running from
Boroughbridge to Greta Bridge, in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The first thoroughfare in London which was
macadamized, a word adapted from the name of
Sir W. Mac Adam, the originator or great improver
of the system, was St. James’s-square; after that,
some of the smaller streets in the aristocratic
parishes of St. James and St. George were
thus paved, and then, but not without great opposition,
Piccadilly. The opposition to the macadamizing
of the latter thoroughfare assumed many forms.
Independently of the conflicting statements as to
extravagance and economy, it was urged by the
opponents, that the dust and dirt of the new style
of paving would cause the street to be deserted by
the aristocracy&mdash;that the noiselessness of the traffic
would cause the deaths of the deaf and infirm&mdash;that
the aristocracy promoted this new-fangled
street-making, that they might the better “sleep
o’ nights,” regardless of all else. One writer especially
regretted that the Duke of Queensberry,
popularly known as “Old Q.,” who resided at the
western end of Piccadilly, had not lived to enjoy,
undisturbed by vulgar noises, his bed of down,
until it was his hour to rise and take his bath of
perfumed milk! In short, there was all the fuss
and absurdity which so often characterise local
contests.</p>

<p>The macadamized street is made by a layer
of stones, broken small and regular in size,
and spread evenly over the road, so that the
pressure and friction of the traffic will knead,
grind, crush, and knit them into one compact
surface. Until road-making became better
understood, or until the early part of the
present century, the roads even in the suburbs
immediately connected with London, such
as Islington, Kingsland, Stoke Newington, and
Hackney, were “repaired when they wanted it.”
If there were a “rut,” or a hole, it was filled up or
covered over with stones, and as the drivers usually
avoided such parts, for the sake of their horses’
feet, another rut was speedily formed alongside of
the original one. Under the old system, road-mending
was patch-work; defects were sought to be
remedied, but there was little or no knowledge of
constructing or of reconstructing the surface as a
whole.</p>

<p>The wood pavement came last, and was not
established, even partially, until eleven or twelve
years ago. One of the earliest places so paved was
the Old Bailey, in order that the noise of the street-traffic
might be deadened in the Criminal Courts.
The same plan was adopted alongside some of the
churches, and other public buildings, where external
quietude, or, at any rate, diminished
noise, was desired. At the first, there were
great complaints made, and frequent expostulations
addressed to the editors of the newspapers, as to the
slipperiness of the wooden ways. The wood
pavement is formed of blocks of wood, generally
deal, fitted to one another by grooves, by joints,
or by shape, for close adjustment. They are
placed on the road over a body of concrete, in the
same way as granite.</p>

<p>“In constructing roads, or rather streets,
through towns or cities, where the amount of
traffic is considerable, it will be found desirable,”
says Mr. Law, in his ‘Treatise on the Constructing
and Repairing of Roads,’ “to pave
their surface. The advantages belonging to pavements
in such situations over macadamized roads
are considerable; where the latter are exposed to
an incessant and heavy traffic, their surface becomes
rapidly worn, rendering constant repairs
requisite, which are not only attended with very
heavy expense, but also render the road very
unpleasant for being travelled upon while being
done; they also require much more attention in
the way of scraping or sweeping, and in raking in
ruts. And some difficulty would be experienced
in towns to find places in which the materials,
which would be constantly wanted for repairing
the road, could be deposited. In dry weather the
macadamized road would always be dusty, and in
wet weather it would be covered with mud. The
only advantage which such a road really possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
over a pavement is the less noise produced by
carriages in passing over it; but this advantage is
very small when the pavement is properly laid.”</p>

<p>Concerning wood pavements the same gentleman
says, “Of late years wood has been introduced
as a material for paving streets, and has
been rather extensively employed both in Russia
and America. It has been tried in various parts
of London, and generally with small success, the
cause of its failure being identical with the cause
of the enormous sums being spent annually in the
repairs of the streets generally, namely, the want of
a proper foundation; a want which was sooner
felt with wood than with granite, in consequence
of the less weight and inertia of the wood. The
comfort resulting from the use of wooden pavement,
both to those who travelled, and those who
lived in the streets, from the diminished jolting
and noise, was so great, that it is just matter of
surprise that so little care was taken in forming
that which a very little consideration would have
shown to be indispensable to its success, namely,
a good foundation. Slipperiness of its surface, in
particular states of the weather, was also found to
be a disadvantage belonging to wooden pavement;
but means might be devised which would render
its surface at all times safe, and afford a secure
footing for horses. As regards durability, it has
scarcely been used for a sufficient period to allow
a comparison being made with other materials,
but from the result of some observations communicated
by Mr. Hope to the Scottish Society of
Arts, it appears that wooden blocks when placed
with the end of the grain exposed, wear <i>less than
granite</i>. At first sight, this result might appear
questionable, but it is a well-ascertained fact that,
where wood and iron move in contact in
machinery, the iron generally wears more rapidly
than the wood, the reason appearing to be, that
the surface of the wood soon becomes covered
with particles of dust and grit, which become
partially embedded in it, and, while they serve to
protect the wood, convert its surface into a species
of file, which rapidly wears away whatever it rubs
against.”</p>

<p>Such then are the different modes of constructing
the London roads or streets. I shall now
endeavour to show the relative length, and relative
cost of the streets thus severally prepared for the
commercial, professional, and pleasurable transit of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>The comparative extent of the macadamized, of
the stone, and of the wood pavement of the streets
of the metropolis has not as yet been ascertained,
for no general account has appeared condensing
the reports, returns, accounts, &amp;c., of the several
specific bodies of management into one grand total.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to arrive at an approximation
as to the comparative extent I have spoken
of; and in this attempt at approximation, in the
absence of all means of a definite statistical computation,
I have had the assistance of an experienced
and practical surveyor, familiar with the
subject.</p>

<p>Macadamization prevails beyond the following
<span class="lock">boundaries:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>North of the New-road and of its extension, as
the City-road, and westward of the New-road’s
junction with Lisson-grove.</p>

<p>Westward of Park-lane and of the West-end
parks.</p>

<p>Eastward of Brick-lane (Spitalfields) and of the
Whitechapel High-street.</p>

<p>Southward (on the Surrey side) from the New-cut
and Long-lane, Bermondsey, and both in
the eastern and western direction of Southwark,
Lambeth, and the other southern parishes.</p>

<p>Stone pavement, on the other hand, prevails in
the district which may be said to be within this
boundary, bearing down upon the Thames in all
directions.</p>

<p>It is, doubtlessly, the fact that in both the districts
thus indicated exceptions to the general rule
may prevail&mdash;that in one, for instance, there
may be some miles of macadamized way, and in
the other some miles of granite pavements; but
such exceptions, I am told by a Commissioner
of Paving, may fairly be dismissed as balancing
each other.</p>

<p>The wooden pavement, I am informed on the
same authority, does not now comprise five miles
of the London thoroughfares; little notice, therefore,
need be taken of it.</p>

<p>The miles of streets in the City in which stone
only affords the street medium of locomotion are
50. The stone pavement in the localities outside
of this area are six times, or approaching to seven
times, the extent of that in the City. I have no
actual admeasurement to demonstrate this point,
for none exists, and no private individual can
offer to measure hundreds of miles of streets in
order to ascertain the composition of their surface.
But the calculation has been made for me
by a gentleman thoroughly conversant with the
subject, and well acquainted with the general
relative proportion of the defined districts,
parishes, and boroughs of the metropolis.</p>

<p>We have thus the following result, as regards

<p>This may appear a disproportionate estimate,
but when it is remembered that the inner police
district of the metropolis extends as far as Hampstead,
Tooting, Brentford, and Greenwich, it will
be readily perceived that the relative proportions
of the macadamized and paved roads are much
about the same as is here stated.</p>

<p>As to the cost of these several roads, I will,
before entering upon that part of the subject,
state the prices of the different materials used in
their manufacture.</p>

<p>Aberdeen granite is now 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> per ton, delivered,
and prepared for paving, or, as it is often
called, “pitching.” A ton of “seven inch”
granite, that is, granite sunk seven inches in the
ground, will cover from two and three-quarters to
three square yards, superficial measure, or nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
feet per yard. The cost, labour included, is,
therefore, from 9<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> the square yard. This
appears very costly; but in some of the more
quiet streets, such as those in the immediate
neighbourhood of Golden and Fitzroy-squares, a
good granite pavement will endure for 20 years,
requiring little repair. In other streets, such as
Cheapside, for instance, it lasts from three to four
years, without repavement being necessary, supposing
the best construction has been originally
adopted.</p>

<p>For macadamized streets, where there is a traffic
like that of Tottenham Court-road, three layers of
small broken granite a year are necessary; the
cost of this repavement being about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
yard superficial measure. The repairs and relayings
on macadamized roads of regular traffic
range from 4<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> yearly, the square yard.</p>

<p>The wood pavement, which endures, with a
trifling outlay for repairs, for about three years,
costs, on an average, 11<i>s.</i> the square yard.</p>

<p>The concrete used as a foundation in this
street-construction costs 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a cube yard, or
27 feet, by which admeasurement it is always
calculated. A cube yard of Thames ballast weighs
about 1&frac14; ton.</p>

<p>The average cost of street-building, new, taking
an average breadth, or about ten yards, from footpath
to footpath, is <span class="lock">then&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As to the amount of resistance to traction
offered by different kinds of pavement, or the same
pavement under different circumstances, the following
are the general results of the experiments
made by M. Morin, at the expense of the French
<span class="lock">Government:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1st. The traction is directly proportional to the
load, and inversely proportional to the diameter of
the wheel.</p>

<p>2nd. Upon a paved, or hard macadamized road,
the resistance is independent of the width of the
tire, when it exceeds from three to four inches.</p>

<p>3rd. At a walking pace the traction is the same,
under the same circumstances, for carriages with
springs and without them.</p>

<p>4th. Upon hard macadamized, and upon paved
roads, the traction increases with the velocity: the
increments of traction being directly proportional
to the increments of velocity above the velocity
3·28 feet per second, or about 2&frac14; miles per hour.
The equal increment of traction thus due to each
equal increment of velocity is less as the road is
more smooth, and the carriage less rigid or better
hung.</p>

<p>5th. Upon soft roads of earth, or sand, or turf,
or roads fresh and thickly gravelled, the traction is
independent of the velocity.</p>

<p>6th. Upon a well-made and compact pavement
of hewn stones, the traction at a walking pace is
not more than three-fourths of that upon the best
macadamized roads under similar circumstances;
at a trotting pace it is equal to it.</p>

<p>7th. The destruction of the road is in all cases
greater, as the diameters of the wheels are less,
and it is greater in carriages without than with
springs.</p>

<p>In Sir H. Parnell’s book on roads, p. 73, we are
told that Sir John Macneill, by means of an instrument
invented by himself for measuring the
tractive force required on different kinds of road,
obtained the following general results as to the
power requisite to move a ton weight under ordinary
circumstances, at a very low velocity.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Traffic of London.</span></h3>

<p>I have shown (at p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>, vol. ii.) that the number
of miles of streets included in the Inner District
of the Metropolitan Police is 1750.</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Cunningham, in his excellent “Handbook
of Modern London,” tells us that “the
streets of the Metropolis, if put together, would
measure 3000 miles in length;” but he does not
inform us what limits he assigns to the said
metropolis; it would seem, however, that he
refers to the Outer Police District: and in another
place he cites the following as the extent of
some of the principal <span class="lock">thoroughfares:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

<p>Of the two great lines of streets parallel to the
river, the one extending along Oxford-street, Holborn,
Cheapside, Cornhill, and Whitechapel to the
Regent’s-canal, Mile-end, is, says Mr. McCulloch,
“above six miles in length;” while that which
stretches from Knightsbridge along Piccadilly, the
Haymarket, Pall-mall East, the Strand, Fleet-street,
Watling-street, Eastcheap, Tower-street,
and so on by Ratcliffe-highway to the West India
Docks, is, according to the same authority, about
equal in length to the other. Mr. Weale asserts,
as we have already seen, that the greatest length
of street from east to west is about fourteen miles,
and from north to south about thirteen miles. The
number of streets in London is said to be 10,000,
though upon what authority the statement is
made, and within what compass it is meant to be
applied, I have not been able to ascertain. It is
calculated, however, that there are 1900 miles of
gas “mains” laid down in London and the
suburbs; so that adopting the estimate of the
Commissioners of Police, or 1760 miles of streets,
within an area of about 90 square miles, we cannot
go far wrong.</p>

<p>Now, as to the amount of <i>traffic</i> that takes
place daily over this vast extent of paved road, it
is almost impossible to predicate anything definitely.
As yet there are only a few crude facts
existing in connection with the subject. All we
know is, that the London streets are daily traversed
by 1500 omnibuses&mdash;such was the number
of drivers licensed by the Metropolitan Commissioners
in 1850&mdash;and about 3000 cabs&mdash;the
number of drivers licensed in 1850 was 5000,
but many “cabs” have a day and night driver as
well, and the Return from the Stamp and Tax
Office cited below, represents the number of
licensed cabriolets, in 1849, at 2846: besides
these public conveyances, there are the private carriages
and carts, so that the metropolitan vehicles
may be said to employ altogether upwards of
20,000 horses.</p>

<p>In the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> I said, when treating
of the London omnibus-drivers and conductors:&mdash;“The
average journey, as regards the distance
travelled by each omnibus, is six miles, and
that distance is, in some cases, travelled twelve
times a day, or as it is called, ‘six there and
six back.’ Some omnibuses perform the journey
only ten times a day, and some, but a minority,
a less number of times. Now, taking the
average distance travelled by each omnibus at
between 45 and 50 miles a day&mdash;and this, I am
assured, on the best authority, is within the mark,
while 60 miles a day might exceed it&mdash;and computing
the omnibuses running daily at 1500, we
find ‘a travel,’ as it was worded to me, of upwards
of 70,000 miles daily, or a yearly ‘travel’
of more than 25,000,000 miles; an extent
which is upwards of a thousand times more than
the circumference of the earth; and that this estimate
in no way exceeds the truth is proved by
the sum annually paid to the Excise for ‘mileage,’
which amounts on an average to 9<i>l.</i> each ’bus’
per month, or collectively to 162,000<i>l.</i> per annum,
and this, at 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per mile (the rate of duty
charged), gives 25,920,000 miles as the aggregate
distance travelled by the entire number of omnibuses
every year through the London streets.”</p>

<p>The distance travelled by the London cabs may
be estimated as follows:&mdash;Each driver may be
said to receive on an average 10<i>s.</i> a day all the
year through. Now, the number of licences prove
that there are 5000 cab-drivers in London, and as
each of these must travel at the least ten miles in
order to obtain the daily 10<i>s.</i>, we may safely
assert that the whole 5000 go over 50,000
miles of ground a day, or, in round numbers,
18,250,000 miles in the course of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>According to a return obtained by Mr. Charles
Cochrane from the Stamp and Tax Office, Somerset
House, there were in the metropolis, in 1849-50,
the following number of <span class="lock">horses:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Private carriage, job, and cart horses (in London)</td><td>3,683</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Ditto (in Westminster)</td><td>6,339</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Cabriolets licensed 2846 (having two horses each)</td><td>5,692</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Omnibuses licensed 1350 (four horses each)</td><td>5,500</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total number of horses in the metropolis</td><td class="total">21,214</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>I am assured, by persons well acquainted with
the omnibus trade, that the number of omnibus
horses here cited is far too low&mdash;as many proprietors
employ ten horses to each “bus,” and none
less than six. Hence we may fairly assume that
there are at the least 25,000 horses at work every
day in the streets of London. Besides the horses
above mentioned, it is estimated that the number
daily coming to the metropolis from the surrounding
parts is 3000; and calculating that each of the
25,000, which may be said to be at work out of
the entire number, travels eight miles a day, the
aggregate length of ground gone over by the whole
would amount to 200,000 miles per diem, or
about 70,000,000 miles throughout the year.
There are, as we have seen, upwards of 1750
miles of streets in London. It follows, therefore,
that each piece of pavement would be traversed
no less than 40,000 times per annum, or upwards
of a hundred times a day, by some horse or
vehicle.</p>

<p>As I said before, the facts that have been collected
concerning the absolute traffic of the several
parts of London are of the most meagre description.
The only observations of any character
that have been made upon the subject are&mdash;as
far as my knowledge goes&mdash;those of M. D’Arcey,
which are contained in a French report upon the
roads of London, as compared with those of
Paris.</p>

<p>This gentleman, speaking of the relative number
of vehicles passing and repassing over certain parts
of the two capitals, says:&mdash;“The Boulevards of
Paris are the parts where the greatest traffic takes
place. On the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard des Capucins</i> there pass,
every 24 hours, 9070 horses drawing carriages;
on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard des Italiens</i>, 10,750; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard
Poissonière</i>, 7720; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard St. Denis</i>, 9609;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard des Filles du Calvaire</i>, 5856: general
average of the above, 8600. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue du Faubourg
St. Antoine</i>, 4300; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avenue des Champs Elysées</i>,
8959. At London, in Pall Mall, opposite Her
Majesty’s Theatre, there pass at least 800 carriages
every hour. On London-bridge the number
of vehicles passing and repassing is not less than
13,000 every hour. On Westminster-bridge the
annual traffic amounts to 8,000,000 horses at the
least. By this it will be seen that the traffic in
Paris does not amount to one-half of what it is in
the streets of London.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Dust and Dirt of the Streets
of London.</span></h3>

<p>We have merely to reflect upon the vast amount
of traffic just shown to be daily going on throughout
London&mdash;to think of the 70,000,000 miles
of journey through the metropolis annually performed
by the entire vehicles (which is more
than two-thirds the distance from the earth to
the sun)&mdash;to bear in mind that each part of London
is on the average gone over and over again
40,000 times in the course of the year, and some
parts as many as 13,000 times in a day&mdash;and
that every horse and vehicle by which the streets
are traversed are furnished, the one with four
iron-bound hoofs, and the other with iron-bound
wheels&mdash;to have an imperfect idea of the enormous
weights and friction continually operating
upon the surface of the streets&mdash;as well as the
amount of grinding and pulverising, and wear
and tear, that must be perpetually taking place in
the paving-stones and macadamized roads of London;
and thus we may be able to form some mental
estimate as to the quantity of dust and dirt
annually produced by these means alone.</p>

<p>But the table in pp. <a href="#Page_186">186-7</a>, which has been collected
at great trouble, will give us still more accurate
notions on the subject. It is not given as perfect,
but as being the best information, in the absence
of positive returns, that was procurable even
from the best informed.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have an aggregate total of dust
collected from the <i>principal</i> parts of the metropolis
amounting to no less than 141,466 loads.
The value of this refuse is said to be as much as
21,221<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i>, but of this and more I shall speak
hereafter. At present I merely seek to give the
reader a general notion upon the matter. I wish
to show him, before treating of the labourers engaged
in the scavenging of the London streets,
the amount of work they have to do.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Dust of London, and the
Loss and Injury occasioned by it.</span></h3>

<p>The daily and nightly grinding of thousands
of wheels, the iron friction of so many
horses’ hoofs, the evacuations of horses and cattle,
and the ceaseless motion of pedestrians, all decomposing
the substance of our streets and roads,
give rise to many distinct kinds of street-dirt.
These are severally known as</p>

<p>(1) <i>Dust.</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>Horse-dung</i> and <i>cattle-manure</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Mud</i>, when mixed with water and with
general refuse, such as the remains of fruit and
other things thrown into the street and swept
together.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Surface-water</i> when mixed with street-sewage.</p>

<p>These productions I shall treat severally, and
first of the street-dust.</p>

<p>The “<i>detritus</i>” of the streets of London
assumes many forms, and is known by many
names, according as it is combined with more or
less water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>1st. In a perfectly dry state, so that the particles
no longer exist either in a state of cohesion
or aggregation, but are minutely divided and distinct,
it is known by the name of “dust.”</p>

<p>2nd. When in combination with a small quantity
of water, so that it assumes the consistency
of a pap, the particles being neither free to move
nor yet able to resist pressure, the detritus is
known by the name of “mac mud,” or simply
“mud,” according as it proceeds from a macadamized
or stone paved road.</p>

<p>3rd. When in combination with a greater quantity
of water, so that it is rendered almost
liquid, it is known as “slop-dirt.”</p>

<p>4th. When in combination with a still greater
quantity of water, so that it is capable of running
off into the sewers, it is known by the name of
“street surface-water.”</p>

<p>The mud of the streets of London is then
merely the dust or detritus of the granite of
which they are composed, agglutinated either with
rain or the water from the watering-carts. Granite
consists of silex, felspar, and mica. Silex is
sand, while felspar and mica are also silex in
combination with alumina (clay), and either potash
or magnesia. Hence it would appear to be owing
to the affinity of the alumina or clay for moisture,
as well as the property of silex to “gelatinize”
with water under certain conditions, that the
particles of dry dust derive their property of
<i>agglutinating</i>, when wetted, and so forming what
is termed “mud”&mdash;either “mac,” or simple mud,
according, as I said before, to the nature of the
paving on which it is formed.</p>

<p>By <i>dust</i> the street-cleansers mean the collection
of every kind of refuse in the dust-bins; but I
here speak, of course, of the fine particles of earthy
matter produced by the attrition of our roads
when in a dry state. Street-dust is, more properly
speaking, mud deprived of its moisture by evaporation.
Miss Landon (L. E. L.) used to describe
the London dust as “mud in high spirits,” and
perhaps no figure of speech could convey a
better notion of its character.</p>

<p>In some parts of the suburbs on windy days
London is a perfect dust-mill, and although the
dust may be allayed by the agency of the water-carts
(by which means it is again converted into
“mac,” or mud), it is not often thoroughly allayed,
and is a source of considerable loss, labour, and
annoyance. Street-dust is not collected for any
useful purpose, so that as there is no return to be
balanced against its prejudicial effects it remains
only to calculate the quantity of it annually produced,
and thus to arrive at the extent of the
mischief.</p>

<p>Street-dust is disintegrated granite, that is, pulverized
quartz and felspar, felspar being principally
composed of alumina or clay, and quartz
silex or sand; it is the result of the attrition, or
in a word it is the <i>detritus</i>, of the stones used in
pavements and in macadamization; it is further
composed of the pulverization of all horse and
cattle-dung, and of the almost imperceptible, but
still, I am assured, existent powder which arises
from the friction of the wooden pavement even
when kept moist. In the roads of the nearest
suburbs, even around such places as the Regent’s-park,
at many seasons this dust is produced
largely, so that very often an open window for
the enjoyment of fresh air is one for the intrusion
of fresh dust. This may be less the case in the
busier and more frequently-watered thoroughfares,
but even there the annoyance is great.</p>

<p>I find in the “Reports” in which this subject
is mentioned but little said concerning the influence
of dust upon the public health. Dr.
Arnott, however, is very explicit on the subject.
“It is,” says he, “scarcely conceivable that the
immense quantities of granite dust, pounded by
one or two hundred thousand pairs of wheels (!)
working on macadamized streets, should not
greatly injure the public health. In houses bordering
such streets or roads it is found that, notwithstanding
the practice of watering, the furniture
is often covered with dust, even more than
once in the day, so that writing on it with the
finger becomes legible, and the lungs and air
tubes of the inhabitants, with a moist lining to
detain the dust, are constantly pumping in the same
atmosphere. The passengers by a stage-coach in
dry weather, when the wind is moving with them
so as to keep them enveloped in the cloud of dust
raised by the horses’ feet and the wheels of the
coach, have their clothes soon saturated to whiteness,
and their lungs are charged in a corresponding
degree. A gentleman who rode only 20
miles in this way had afterwards to cough and expectorate
for ten days to clear his chest again.”</p>

<p>In order that the deleteriousness to health incident
to the inhalation of these fine and offensive
particles may be the better estimated, I may
add, that in every 24 hours an adult breathes
36 hogsheads of air; and Mr. Erasmus Wilson,
in his admirable work on the Skin, has the following
passage concerning the extent of surface
presented by the <span class="lock">lungs:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The lungs receive the atmospheric air through
the windpipe. At the root of the neck the windpipe,
or trachea, divides into two branches, called
bronchi, and each bronchus, upon entering its
respective lung, divides into an infinity of small
tubes; the latter terminate in small pouches,
called air-cells, and a number of these little
air-cells communicate together at the extremity
of each small tube. The number of air-cells in
the two lungs has been estimated at 1,744,000,000,
and the extent of the skin which lines the cells
and tubes together at 1500 square feet. This calculation
of the number of air-cells, and the extent
of the lining membrane, rests, I believe, on the
authority of Dr. Addison of Malvern.”</p>

<p>What is the amount of atmospherical granite,
dung, and refuse-dust received in a given period
into the human lungs, has never, I am informed,
been ascertained even by approximation; but according
to the above facts it must be something
fearful to contemplate.</p>

<p>After this brief recital of what is known concerning
the sanitary part of the question, I proceed to
consider the damage and loss occasioned by street-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>dust.
In no one respect, perhaps, can this be
ascertained with perfect precision, but still even
a rough approximation to the extent of the evil
is of value, as giving us more definite ideas on the
subject.</p>

<p>It will be seen, on reference to the preceding
table, that the quantity of street-refuse collected
in dry weather throughout the metropolis is between
300 and 400 cart-loads daily, or upwards
of 100,000 cart-loads, the greater proportion of
which may be termed street-dust.</p>

<p>The damage occasioned by the street-dust
arises from its penetrating, before removal, the
atmosphere both without and within our houses,
and consists in the soiling of wearing apparel, the
injury of the stock-in-trade of shopkeepers, and
of household furniture.</p>

<p>Washing is, of course, dependent upon the
duration of time in which it is proper, in the
estimation of the several classes of society, to
retain wearing apparel upon the person, on the
bed or the table, without what is termed a
“change;” and this duration of time with thousands
of both men and women is often determined
by the presence or absence of dirt on the
garment; and not arbitrarily, as among wealthier
people, with whom a clean shirt every morning,
and a clean table-cloth every one, two, three, or
more days, as may happen, are regarded as things
of course, no matter what may be the state of the
displaced linen.</p>

<p>The Board of Health, in one of their Reports,
speak very decisively and definitely on this subject.
“Common observation of the rate at which
the skin, linen, and clothes (not to speak of paper,
books, prints, and furniture) become dirty in the
metropolis,” say they, “as compared with the time
that elapses before a proportionate amount of
deterioration and uncleanliness is communicated in
the rural districts, will warrant the estimate, that
<i>full one-half the expense of washing to maintain
a passable degree of cleanliness</i>, is rendered necessary
by the excess of smoke generated in open
fires, and the <i>excess of dust arising from the imperfect
scavenging of the roads and streets</i>. Persons
engaged in washing linen on a large scale,
state that it is dirtied in the crowded parts of the
metropolis in <i>one-third</i> the time in which the like
degree of uncleanliness would be produced in a
rural district; but all attest the fact, that linen is
more rapidly destroyed by washing than by the
wear on the person. The expense of the more
rapid destruction of linen must be added to the
extra expense of washing. These expenses and
inconveniences, the greater portion of which are
due to <i>local maladministration, occasion an extra
expenditure of upwards of two to three millions
per annum</i>&mdash;exclusive of the injury done to the
general health and the medical and other expenses
consequent thereon.”</p>

<p>Here, then, we find the evil effects of the imperfect
scavenging of the metropolis estimated at
between two and three millions sterling per annum,
and this in the mere matter of extra washing and
its necessary concomitant extra wear and tear of
clothes.</p>

<p>As this estimate, however, appears to me
to exaggerate the evil beyond all due bounds, I
will proceed to adduce a few facts, bearing upon
the point: and first as to the expense of washing.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain as accurately as possible,
the actual washing expenses of labouring men and
their families whose washing was done at home,
Mr. John Bullar, the Honorary Secretary to the
Association for the Promotion of Baths and Washhouses,
tells us in a Report presented to Parliament,
“that inquiries were made of several hundred
families of labouring men, and it was found that,
<i>taking the wife’s labour as worth 5s. a week!</i> the
total cost of washing at home, for a man and wife
and four children, averaged very closely on 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week, = 5<i>d.</i> a head. The cost of coals, soda,
soap, starch, blue, and sometimes water, was
rather less than one-third of the amount. The
time occupied was rarely less than two days, and
more often extended into a third day, so that the
value of the labour was rather more than two-thirds
of the amount.</p>

<p>“The cost of washing to single men among the
labouring classes, whose washing expenditure
might be expected to be on a very low scale, such
as hod-men and street-sweepers, was found to be
4&frac12;<i>d.</i> a head.</p>

<p>“The cost of washing to very small tradesmen
could not be safely estimated at much more than
6<i>d.</i> a head a week.</p>

<p>“It may, perhaps,” continues the Report, “be
safe to reckon the weekly washing expenses of the
poorer half of the inhabitants of the metropolis at
not exceeding 6<i>d.</i> a head; but the expenditure for
washing rapidly increases as the inquiry ascends
into what are called the ‘middle classes.’</p>

<p>“The washing expenses of families in which
servants are employed may be considered as
double that of the servants’, and, therefore, as
ranging from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> a week a head.</p>

<p>“There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining
with any exactness the washing expenditure of
private families, but the conclusion is that, taking
the whole population, the washing bills of London
are nearly 1<i>s.</i> a week a head, or 5,000,000<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p>“Of course,” adds Mr. Bullar, “I give this as
but a rough estimate, and many exceptions may
easily be taken to it; but I feel pretty confident
that <i>it is not very far</i> from the truth.”</p>

<p>As I before stated, I am in no way disposed
to go to the extent of the calculation here made.
It appears to me that in parliamentary investigations
by the agency of select committees, or by
gentlemen appointed to report on any subject,
there is an aptitude to deal with the whole
body of the people as if they were earning the
wages of well and regularly-employed labourers,
or even mechanics. To suppose that the starving
ballast-heaver, the victim of a vicious truck
system, which condemns him to poverty and
drunkenness, or the sweep, or the dustman,
or the street-seller&mdash;all very numerous classes&mdash;expends
1<i>s.</i> a week in his washing, is far beyond
the fact. Still less is expended in the washing
of these people’s children. Even the well-conducted
artizan, with two clean shirts a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
(costing him 6<i>d.</i>), with the washing of stockings,
&amp;c. (costing 1<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i>), does not expend 1<i>s.</i> a
week; so that, though the washing bills of many
ladies and of some gentlemen may average 10<i>s.</i>
weekly, if we consider how few are rich and
how many poor, the extra payment seems insufficient
to make up the average of the weekly
shilling for the washing of all classes.</p>

<p>A prosperous and respectable master greengrocer,
who was what may be called “particular”
in his dress, as he had been a gentleman’s servant,
and was now in the habit of waiting upon the
wealthy persons in his neighbourhood, told me
that the following was the average of his washing
bill. He was a bachelor; all his washing was
put out, and he considered his expenditure far
<i>above</i> the average of his class, as many used no
night-shirt, but slept in the shirts they wore during
the day, and paid only 3<i>d.</i>, and even less, per
shirt to their washer-woman, and perhaps, and
more especially in winter, made one shirt last the
week.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Two shirts (per week)</td><td>7<i>d.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Stockings</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Night-shirt (worn two weeks generally, average per week)</td><td>0&frac34;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sheets, blankets, and other household linens or woollens</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Handkerchiefs</td><td>0&frac14;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="total">11<i>d.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>My informant was satisfied that he had put his
expenditure at the highest. I also ascertained that
an industrious wife, who was able to attend to her
household matters, could wash the clothes of a
small tradesman’s family,&mdash;for a man, his wife,
and four small children,&mdash;“well,” at the following
<span class="lock">rate:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>1 lb. soap</td><td>4&frac12;<i>d.</i> or 5<i>d.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Soda and starch</td><td>0&frac12;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&frac14; cwt. coals (extra)</td><td>3&frac12;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="total">8&frac12;<i>d.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>or less than 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per head.</p>

<p>In this calculation it will be seen the cheapest
soap is reckoned, and that <i>there is no allowance
for the wife’s labour</i>. When I pointed out the
latter circumstance, my informant said: “I look
on it that the washing labour is part of the wife’s
keep, or what she gives in return for it; and that
as she’d have to be kept if she didn’t do it, why
there shouldn’t be no mention of it. If she was
working for others it would be quite different,
but washing is a family matter; that’s my way
of looking at it. Coke, too, is often used instead
of coals; besides, a bit of bacon, or potatoes, or
the tea-kettle, will have to be boiled, and that’s
managed along with the hot water for the suds,
and would have to be done anyhow, especially in
winter.”</p>

<p>One decent woman, who had five children,
“all under eight,” told me she often sat up half,
and sometimes the whole night to wash, when
busy other ways. She was not in poverty, for
she earned “a good bit” in going out to cook, and
her husband was employed by a pork-butcher.</p>

<p>I may further add, that a great many single men
wash their own clothes. Many of the street-sellers in
particular do this; so do such of the poor as live in
their own rooms, and occasionally the dwellers in
the low lodging-houses. One street-seller of ham
sandwiches, whose aprons, sleeves, and tray-cloth,
were remarkably white, told me that he washed
them himself, as well as his shirt, &amp;c., and that
it was the common practice with his class. This
washing&mdash;his aprons, tray-cloths, shirts, and stockings
included&mdash;cost him, every three weeks, 4&frac14;<i>d.</i>
or 5<i>d.</i> for 1 lb. of soap, which is less than 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a
week. Among such people it is considered that the
washing of a shirt is, as they say, “a penn’orth of
soap, and the stockings in,” meaning that a penny
outlay is sufficient to wash for both.</p>

<p>But not only does Mr. Bullar’s estimate exceed
the truth as regards the cost of washing among
the poorer classes, but it also errs in the proportion
they are said to bear to the other ranks of
society. That gentleman speaks of “the poorer
<i>half</i> of the inhabitants of the metropolis,” as if
the rich and poor were equal in numbers! but
with all deference, it will be found that the ratio between
the well-to-do and the needy is as 1 to 2, that
is to say, the property and income-tax returns teach
us there are at least two persons with an income <i>below</i>
150<i>l.</i> per annum, to every one having an income
<i>above</i> it. Hence, the population of London being,
within a fraction, 2,400,000; the numbers of the
metropolitan well-to-do and needy would be respectively
800,000 and 1,600,000, and, allowing
the cost of the washing of the former to average
1<i>s.</i> per head (adults and children), and, the washing
of the labouring classes to come to 2<i>d.</i> a head,
young and old (the expense of the materials, when
the work is done at home, average, it has been
shown, about 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> for each member of the family),
we shall then have the following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Annual cost of washing for 800,000 people, at 1<i>s.</i> per head per week</td><td>£2,080,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Annual cost of washing for 1,600,000 people, at 2<i>d.</i> per head per week</td><td>693,333</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total cost of washing of metropolis</td><td class="total">£2,773,333</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I am convinced, low as the estimate of 2<i>d.</i> a
week may appear for all whose incomes are under
150<i>l.</i> a year, from many considerations, that
the above computation is rather over than under
the truth. As, for instance, Mr. Hawes has said
concerning the consumption of soap in the metropolis,&mdash;“Careful
inquiry has proved that the
quantity used is much greater than that indicated
by the Excise returns; but reducing the results
obtained by inquiry in one uniform proportion,
the quantity used by the labouring classes earning
from 10<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> per week is 10 lbs. each per
annum, including every member of the family.
Dividing the population of the metropolis into
three classes: (1) the wealthy; (2) the shopkeepers
and tradesmen; (3) labourers and the
poor, and allowing 15 lbs., 10 lbs., and 4 lbs. to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
each respectively, the consumption of the metropolis
will be nearly 200 tons per week.” The
cost of each ton of soap Mr. Hawes estimates
at 45<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Professor Clarke, however, computes the metropolitan
consumption of soap at 250 tons per
week, and the cost per ton at 50<i>l.</i></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">According to the above estimates, the total quantity of soap used every year in the metropolis is 12,000 tons, and this, at 50<i>l.</i> per ton, comes to</td><td>£600,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Professor Clarke reckons the gross consumption of soda in the metropolis, at 250 tons per month, costing 10<i>l.</i> a ton; hence for the year the consumption will be 3000 tons, costing</td><td>30,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The cost of water, according to the same authority, is 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per head per annum, and this, for the whole metropolis, amounts to</td><td>400,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Estimating the cost of the coals used in heating the water to be equal to that of the soap, we have for the gross expense of fuel annually consumed in washing</td><td>600,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">There are 21,000 laundresses in London, and, calculating that the wages of these average 10<i>s.</i> a week each all the year round, the gross sum paid to them, would be in round numbers</td><td>550,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Profit of employers, say</td><td>550,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Add for sundries, as starch, &amp;c.</td><td>50,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total cost of washing of metropolis</td><td class="total">£2,780,000</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Hence it would appear, that viewed either by
the individual expense of the great bulk of society,
or else by the aggregate cost of the materials and
labour used in cleansing the clothes of the people
of London, the total sum annually expended in
the washing of the metropolis may be estimated
at the outside at two millions and three quarters
sterling per annum, or about 1<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per head.</p>

<p>And yet, though the data for the calculation
here given, as to the cost and quantity of the
principal materials used in cleansing the clothes of
London, are derived from the same Report as that
in which the expense of the metropolitan washing
is estimated at 5,000,000<i>l.</i> per annum, the Board
of Health do not hesitate in that document to say
that,&mdash;“Of the fairness of the estimate of the
expense of washing to the higher and middle
classes, and to the great bulk of the householders,
and the better class of artizans, we entertain
no doubt whatever. Whatsoever deductions, if
any, may be made from the above estimate, it is,
nevertheless, an <i>under-estimate</i> for maintaining,
at the present expense of washing, a proper
amount of cleanliness in linen.”</p>

<p>Proceeding, however, with the calculation as to
the loss from the imperfect scavenging of the
metropolis, we have the following <span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>


<h4>LOSS FROM DUST AND DIRT IN THE STREETS OF
THE METROPOLIS, OWING TO THE EXTRA
WASHING ENTAILED THEREBY.</h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">According to the Board of Health, taking the yearly amount of the washing of the metropolis at 5,000,000<i>l.</i>, and assuming the washing to be doubled by street-dirt, the loss will be</td><td>£2,500,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Calculating the washing, however, for reasons above adduced, to be only 2,750,000<i>l.</i>, and to be as much again as it might be under an improved system of scavenging, the loss will be</td><td>1,375,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Or calculating, <i>as a minimum</i>, that the remediable loss is less than one-half, the cost is</td><td>£1,000,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence it would appear that the loss from
dust and dirt is <i>really enormous</i>.</p>

<p>In a work entitled “Sanatory Progress,” being
the Fifth Report of the National Philanthropic
Association, I find a calculation as to the losses
sustained from dust and dirt upon our clothes.
Owing to the increased wear from daily brushing
to remove the dust, and occasional scraping to
remove the mud, the loss is estimated at from
3<i>l.</i> to 7<i>l.</i> per annum for each well-dressed man
and woman, and 1<i>l.</i> for inferiorly-dressed persons,
including their Sunday and holiday clothing.</p>

<p>I inquired of a West-end tailor, who previously
to his establishment in business had himself been
an operative, and had had experience both in
town and country as to the wear of clothes, and I
learned from him the following particulars.</p>

<p>With regard to the clothes of the wealthy
classes, of those who could always command a
carriage in bad weather, there are no means of
judging as to the loss caused by bad scavengery.</p>

<p>My informant, however, obliged me with the
following calculations, the results of his experience.
His trade is what I may describe as a medium
business, between the low slop and the high
fashionable trades. The garments of which he
spoke were those worn by clerks, shopmen,
students, tradesmen, town-travellers, and others
not engaged in menial or handicraft labour.</p>

<p>Altogether, and after consulting his books relative
to town and country customers, my informant
thought it might be easy to substantiate the following
estimate as regards the duration and cost
of clothes in town and country among the classes
I have specified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

</table></div>
<p>Here, then, it appears that the annual outlay
for clothes in town, by the classes I have specified,
is about 2<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i>; while the annual outlay in the
country for the same garments is 1<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>;
the difference of expense being 16<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per
annum. I consulted another tailor on the subject,
and his estimate was a trifle above that of
my informant.</p>

<p>I should remark that the proportion thus adduced
holds, <i>whatever be the number of garments</i> worn
in the year, or in a series of years, for the calculation
was made not as to individual garments,
but as to the general wear, evinced by the average
outlay, as shown in the tradesman’s books, of the
same class of persons in town and country.</p>

<p>In the calculation given in the publication of
the National Philanthropic Association, the loss
on a well-dressed Londoner’s clothing, arising from
excessive dust and dirt, is estimated at from 3<i>l.</i>
to 7<i>l.</i> per annum. By the above table it will
be seen that the clothes which cost 1<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
per annum in the cleanliness of a country abode,
cost 2<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i>, or, within a fraction, half as much
again, in the uncleanliness of a London atmosphere
and roads. If, therefore, any London inhabitant,
of the classes I have specified, expend
four times 2<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> in his clothes yearly, as
many do, or 10<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>, he loses 3<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, or
5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> more than the minimum mentioned in
the Report alluded to.</p>

<p>Now estimating 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> as the yearly tailor’s
bill among the well-to-do (boys and men), and calculating
that one-sixth of the metropolitan population
(that is, half of the one-third who may be
said to belong to the class having incomes above
150<i>l.</i> a year) spend this sum yearly in clothes, we
have the following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It would be pushing the inquiry to exceeding

the comparative expense of boots, hats, and ladies’
dresses worn in town and country; suffice it, that
competent persons in each of the vestiary trades
have been seen, and averages drawn for the accounts
of their town and country customers.</p>

<p>All things, then, being duly considered, the following

<p>As regards the loss and damage occasioned by
the injury to household furniture and decorations,
and to stocks-in-trade, which is another important
consideration connected with this subject, I find
the following statement in the Report of the Philanthropic
Institution:&mdash;“The loss by goods
and furniture is incalculable: shopkeepers lose
from 10<i>l.</i> to 150<i>l.</i> a-year by the spoiling of their
goods for sale; dealers in provisions especially,
who cannot expose them without being deteriorated
in value, from the dust that is incessantly
settling upon them. Nor is it much
better with clothiers of all kinds:&mdash;Mr. Holmes,
shawl merchant, in Regent-street, has stated that
his losses from road-dust alone exceed 150<i>l.</i>
per annum.”... “In a communication
with Mr. Mivart, respecting the expenses of mud
and road-dust to him, that gentleman stated that
the rent of the four houses of which his hotel is
composed, was 896<i>l.</i>; and that he could not (considering
the cost of cleaning and servants) estimate
the expense of repairing the damage done by the
dirt and dust, carried and blown into these houses,
at a less annual sum than that of his rent!”</p>

<p>An upholsterer obliged me with the following
calculations, but so many were the materials, and so
different the rates of wear or the liability to injury
in different materials in his trade, that he could
only calculate generally.</p>

<p>The same quality, colour, and pattern of curtains,
silk damasks, which he had furnished to a
house in town, and to a country house belonging
to the same gentleman, looked far fresher and
better after five years’ wear in the country than
after three in town. Both windows had a southern
aspect, but the occupant would have his windows
partially open unless the weather was cold, foggy,
or rainy. It was the same, or nearly the same,
he thought, with the carpets on the two places, for
London dust was highly injurious to all the better
qualities of carpets. He was satisfied, also, it was
the same generally in upholstery work subjected
to town dust.</p>

<p>I inquired at several West-end and city shops,
and of different descriptions of tradesmen, of the
injury done to their shop and shop-window goods
by the dust, but I found none who had made any
calculations on the subject. All, however, agreed
that the dust was an excessive annoyance, and entailed
great expense; a ladies’ shoemaker and a
bookseller expressed this particularly&mdash;on the necessity
of making the window a sort of small
glass-house to exclude the dust, which, after all,
was not sufficiently excluded. All thought, or
with but one hesitating exception, that the estimation
as to the loss sustained by the Messrs.
Holmes, considering the extent of their premises,
and the richness of the goods displayed in the
windows, &amp;c., was not in excess.</p>

<p>I can, then, but indicate the injury to household
furniture and stock-in-trade as a corroboration of
all that has been advanced touching the damaging
effects of road dirt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Horse-Dung of the Streets of
London.</span></h3>

<p>“Familiarity with streets of crowded traffic
deadens the senses to the perception of their
actual condition. Strangers coming from the
country frequently describe the streets of London
as smelling of dung like a stable-yard.”</p>

<p>Such is one of the statements in a Report submitted
to Parliament, and there is no reason to
doubt the fact. Every English visitor to a French
city, for instance, must have detected street-odours
of which the inhabitants were utterly unconscious.
In a work which between 20 and 30 years ago
was deservedly popular, Mathews’s “Diary of
an Invalid,” it is mentioned that an English lady
complaining of the villanous rankness of the air
in the first French town she entered&mdash;Calais, if I
remember rightly&mdash;received the comfortable assurance,
“It is the smell of the Continent, ma’am.”
Even in Cologne itself, the “most stinking city
of Europe,” as it has been termed, the citizens
are insensible to the foul airs of their streets, and
yet possess great skill in manufacturing perfumed
and distilled waters for the toilet, pluming themselves
on the delicacy and discrimination of their
nasal organs. What we perceive in other cities,
as strangers, those who visit London detect in
our streets&mdash;that they smell of dung like stable-yards.
It is idle for London denizens, because
they are unconscious of the fact, to deny the
existence of any such effluvia. I have met with
nightmen who have told me that there was
“nothing particular” in the smell of the cesspools
they were emptying; they “hardly perceived it.”
One man said, “Why, it’s like the sort of stuff
I’ve smelt in them ladies’ smelling-bottles.” An
eminent tallow-melter said, in the course of his
evidence before Parliament during a sanitary inquiry,
that the smell from the tallow-melting on
his premises was not only healthful and reviving&mdash;for
invalids came to inhale it&mdash;but agreeable.
I mention these facts to meet the scepticism
which the official assertion as to the stable-like
odour of the streets may, perhaps, provoke.
When, however, I state the <i>quantity</i> of horse-dung
and “cattle-droppings” voided in the
streets, all incredulity, I doubt not, will be removed.</p>

<p>“It has been ascertained,” says the Report of
the National Philanthropic Association, “that
four-fifths of the street-dirt consist of horse and
cattle-droppings.”</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, endeavour to arrive at definite
notions as to the absolute quantity of this
element of street-dirt.</p>

<p>And, first, as to the number of cattle and horses
traversing the streets of London.</p>

<p>In the course of an inquiry in November,
1850, into Smithfield-market, I adduced the following
results as to the number of cattle entering
the metropolis, deriving the information from the
experience of Mr. Deputy Hicks, confirmed by
returns to Parliament, by the amount of tolls, and
further ratified by the opinion of some of the
most experienced “live salesmen” and “dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
salesmen” (sellers on commission of live and dead
cattle), whose assistance I had the pleasure of
obtaining.</p>

<p>The return is of the stock <i>annually</i> sold in
Smithfield-market, and includes not only English
but foreign beasts, sheep, and calves; the latter averaging
weekly in 1848 (the latest return then published),
beasts, 590; sheep, 2478; and calves, 248.</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td>Total</td><td class="total">1,841,300.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I may remark that this is not a criterion of
the consumption of animal food in the metropolis,
for there are, besides the above, the daily supplies
from the country to the “dead salesmen.”
The preceding return, however, is sufficient for
my present purpose, which is to show the quantity
of cattle manure “dropped” in London.</p>

<p>The number of cattle entering the metropolis,
then, are 1,841,300 per annum.</p>

<p>The number of horses daily traversing the metropolis
has been already set forth. By a return
obtained by Mr. Charles Cochrane from the Stamp
and Tax Office, we have seen that there are
altogether</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="left">Horses daily coming to metropolis</td><td>3,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total number of horses daily in London</td><td class="total">24,214</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The total here given includes the returns of
horses which were either taxed or the property of
those who employ them in hackney-carriages in
the metropolis. But the whole of these 24,214
horses are not at work in the streets every day.
Perhaps it might be an approximation to the
truth, if we reckoned five-sixths of the horses as
being worked regularly in the public thoroughfares;
so that we arrive at the conclusion that
20,000 horses are daily worked in the metropolis;
and hence we have an aggregate of
7,300,000 horses traversing the streets of London
in the twelvemonth. The beasts, sheep, calves,
and pigs driven and conveyed to and from Smithfield
are, we have seen, 1,841,300 in number.
These, added together, make up a total of
9,141,300 animals appearing annually in the
London thoroughfares. The circumstance of
Smithfield cattle-market being held but twice a
week in no way detracts from the amount here
given; for as the gross number of individual
cattle coming to that market in the course of the
year is given, each animal is estimated as appearing
only once in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The next point for consideration is&mdash;what is the
quantity of dung dropped by each of the above
animals while in the public thoroughfares?</p>

<p>Concerning the quantity of excretions passed
by a horse in the course of 24 hours there have
been some valuable experiments made by philosophers
whose names alone are a sufficient
guarantee for the accuracy of their researches.</p>

is copied from the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie

<p>Here it will be seen that the quantity of solid
food given to the horse in the course of the 24
hours amounted only to 26 lbs.; whereas it is
stated in the Report of the National Philanthropic
Association, on the authority of the veterinary
surgeon to the Life Guards, that the regulation
horse rations in all cavalry regiments is 30 lbs.
of solid food; viz., 10 lbs. of oats, 12 lbs. of
hay, together with 8 lbs. of straw, for the horse
to lie upon and munch at his leisure. “This
quantity of solid food, with five gallons of water,
is considered sufficient,” we are told, “for all
regimental horses, who have but little work to
perform, in comparison with the draught horses
of the metropolis, many of which consume daily
35 lbs. and upwards of solid food, with at least
six gallons of water.</p>

<p>“At a conference held with the secretary and
professors of the Veterinary College in College-street,
Camden-town,” continues the Report,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
“those gentlemen kindly undertook to institute
a series of experiments in this department of
equine physiology; the subject being one which
interested themselves, professionally, as well as
the council of the National Philanthropic Association.
The experiments were carefully conducted
under the superintendence of Professor
Varnell. The food, drink, and voidances of
several horses, kept in stable all day long, were
separately weighed and measured; and the following
were the results with an animal of medium

</p>

<p>Here we find the excretions to be 11 lbs.
more than those of the French horse experimented
upon by M. Boussingault; but then the solid
food given to the English horse was 4 lbs. more,
and the liquid upwards of 7 lbs. extra.</p>

<p>We may then, perhaps, assume, without fear of
erring, that the excrements voided by horses in
the course of 24 hours, weigh, at the least,
45 lbs.</p>

<p>Hence the gross quantity of dung produced by
the 7,300,000 horses which traverse the London
streets in the course of the twelvemonth will be
7,300,000 × 45, or 328,500,000 lbs., which is
upwards of 146,651 tons. But these horses
cannot be said to be at work above six hours
each day; we must, therefore, divide the above
quantity by four, and thus we find that there are
36,662 tons of horse-dung annually dropped in
the streets of London.</p>

<p>I am informed, on good authority, that the
evacuations of an ox, in 24 hours, will, on the
average, exceed those of a horse in weight by
about a fifteenth, while, if the ox be disturbed
by being driven, the excretions will exceed the
horse’s by about a twelfth. As the oxen are not
driven in the streets, or detained in the market
for so long a period as horses are out at work, it
may be fair to compute that their droppings are
about the same, individually, as those of the
horses.</p>

<p>Hence, as there are 224,000 horned cattle yearly
brought to London, we have 224,000 × 45 lbs.
= 10,080,000 lbs., or 4500 tons, for the gross
quantity of ordure dropped by this number of
animals in the course of 24 hours, so that, dividing
by 4, as before, we find that there are 1125
tons of ordure annually dropped by the “horned
cattle” in the streets of London.</p>

<p>Concerning the sheep, I am told that it may
be computed that the ordure of five sheep is about
equal in weight to that of two oxen. As regards
the other animals it may be said that their
“droppings” are insignificant, the pigs and calves
being very generally carted to and from the market,
as, indeed, are some of the fatter and more valuable
sheep and lambs. All these facts being taken into
consideration, I am told, by a regular frequenter
of Smithfield market, that it will be best to calculate
the droppings of each of the 1,617,300
sheep, calves, and pigs yearly coming to the metropolis
at about one-fourth of those of the horned
cattle; so that multiplying 1,617,300 by 10, instead
of 45, we have 16,173,000 lbs., or 7220 tons, for
the weight of ordure deposited by the entire number
of sheep, calves, and pigs annually brought to
the metropolis, and then dividing this by 4, as
usual, we find that the droppings of the calves,
sheep, and pigs in the streets of London amount
to 1805 tons per annum.</p>

<p>Now putting together all the preceding items
we obtain the following <span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gross Weight of the Horse-Dung and
Cattle-Droppings annually deposited in
the Streets of London</span>:&mdash;</h4>

</table></div>

<p>Hence we perceive that the gross weight of
animal excretions dropped in the public thoroughfares
of the metropolis is about 40,000 tons
per annum, or, in round numbers, 770 tons every
week-day&mdash;say 100 tons a day.</p>

<p>This, I am well aware, is a low estimate, but
it appears to me that the facts will not warrant
any other conclusion. And yet the Board of
Health, who seem to delight in “large” estimates,
represent the amount of animal manure deposited
in the streets of London at no less than 200,000
tons per annum.</p>

<p>“Between the Quadrant in Regent-street and
Oxford-street,” says the first Report on the Supply
of Water to the Metropolis, “a distance of a third
of a mile, three loads, on the average, of dirt, almost
all horse-dung, are removed daily. On an estimate
made from the working of the street-sweeping
machine, in one quarter of the City of London,
which includes lines of considerable traffic, the
quantity of dung dropped must be upwards of 60
tons, or about 20,000 tons per annum, and this,
on a City district, which comprises about one-twentieth
only of the covered area of the metropolis,
though within that area there is the greatest proportionate
amount of traffic. Though the data are
extremely imperfect, it is considered that the
horse-dung which falls in the streets of the whole
metropolis <i>cannot be less than 200,000 tons a
year</i>.”</p>

<p>Hence, although the data are imperfect, the
Board of Health do not hesitate to conclude that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the gross quantity of horse-dung dropped throughout
every part of London&mdash;back streets and all&mdash;is
equal to one-half of that let fall in the greatest
London thoroughfares. According to this estimate,
all and every of the 24,000 London horses
must void, in the course of the six hours that they
are at work in the streets, not less than 51 lbs. of
excrement, which is at the rate of very nearly
2 cwt. in the course of the day, or voiding only
49 lbs. in the twenty-four hours, they must remain
out altogether, and never return to the stable for
rest!!!</p>

<p>Mr. Cochrane is far less hazardous than the
Board of Health, and appears to me to arrive at
his result in a more scientific and conclusive
manner. He goes first to the Stamp Office to
ascertain the number of horses in the metropolis,
and then requests the professors of the Veterinary
College to estimate the average quantity of excretions
produced by a horse in the course of 24
hours. All this accords with the soundest principles
of inquiry, and stands out in startling contrast
with the unphilosophical plan pursued by the
Board of Health, who obtain the result of the
most crowded thoroughfare, and then halving
this, frame an exaggerated estimate for the whole
of the metropolis.</p>

<p>But Mr. Cochrane himself appears to me to
exceed that just caution which is so necessary in
all statistical calculations. Having ascertained
that a horse voids 49 lbs. of dung in the course of
24 hours, he makes the whole of the 24,214 horses
in the metropolis drop 30 lbs. daily in the streets,
so that, according to his estimate, not only must
every horse in London be out every day, but he
must be at work in the public thoroughfares for
very nearly 15 hours out of the 24!</p>

<p>The following is the estimate made by Mr.
<span class="lock">Cochrane:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Daily weight of manure deposited in the streets
by 24,214 horses × 30 lbs. = 726,420 lbs.,
or 324 tons, 5 cwt., 100 lbs.</p>

<p>Weekly weight, 2270 tons, 1 cwt., 28 lbs.</p>

<p>Annual weight, 118,043 tons, 5 cwt.</p>

<p>Tons or cart-loads deposited annually, valued at
6<i>s.</i> × 118,043 = 35,412<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p></div>

<p>It has, then, been here shown that, assuming
the number of horses worked daily in the streets
of London to be 20,000, and each to be out
six hours <i>per diem</i>, which, it appears to me,
is all that can be fairly reckoned, the quantity
of horse-dung dropped weekly is about 700
tons, so that, including the horses of the cavalry
regiments in London, which of course are not
comprised in the Stamp-Office returns, as well
as the animals taken to Smithfield, we may, perhaps,
assert that the annual ordure let fall in the
London streets amounts, at the outside, to somewhere
about 1000 tons weekly, or 52,000 tons
per annum.</p>

<p>The next question becomes&mdash;what is done with
this vast amount of filth?</p>

<p>The Board of Health is a much better guide
upon this point than upon the matter of quantity:
“Much of the horse-dung dropped in the London
streets, under ordinary circumstances,” we are told,
“dries and is pulverized, and with the common
soil is carried into houses as dust, and dirties
clothes and furniture. The odour arising from
the surface evaporation of the streets when they
are wet is chiefly from horse-dung. Susceptible
persons often feel this evaporation, after partial
wetting, to be highly oppressive. The surface-water
discharged into sewers from the streets and roofs
of houses is found to contain as much filth as the
soil-water from the house-drains.”</p>

<p>Here, then, we perceive that the whole
of the animal manure let fall in the streets
is worse than wasted, and yet we are assured that
it is an article, which, if properly collected, is of
considerable value. “It is,” says the Report of
the National Philanthropic Association, “an
article of Agricultural and Horticultural commerce
which has ever maintained a high value with the
farmers and market-gardeners, wherever conveniently
obtainable. When these cattle-droppings
can be collected <i>unmixed</i>, in dry weather, they
bear an acknowledged value by the grazier and
root-grower;&mdash;there being no other kind of manure
which fertilizes the land so bounteously. Mr.
Marnock, Curator of the Royal Botanical Society,
has valued them at from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> per load; according
to the season of the year. The United
Paving Board of St. Giles and St. George, since
the introduction of the Street Orderly System into
their parishes, has wisely had it collected in a state
separate from all admixture, and sold it at highly
remunerative prices, rendering it the means of
considerably lessening the expense of cleansing
the streets.”</p>

<p>Now, assuming the value of the street-dropped
manure to be 6<i>s.</i> per ton when collected free
from dirt, we have the following statement
as to the value of the horse and cattle-voidances
let fall in the streets of <span class="lock">London:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">52,000 tons of cattle-droppings, at 6<i>s.</i> per ton</td><td>£15,600</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mr. Cochrane, who considers the quantity of
animal-droppings to be much greater, attaches of
course a greater value to the aggregate quantity.
His computation is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">118,043 tons of cattle-droppings, at 6<i>s.</i> per ton</td><td>£35,412</td><td>19</td><td>6</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It seems to me that the calculations of the
quantity of horse and cattle-dung in the streets,
are based on such well-authenticated and scientific
foundations, that their accuracy can hardly be disputed,
unless it be that a higher average might
fairly be shown.</p>

<p>Whatever estimate be adopted, the worth of
street-dropped animal manure, if properly secured
and made properly disposable, is great and indisputable;
most assuredly between 10,000<i>l.</i> and
20,000<i>l.</i> in value.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Of Street “Mac” and other Mud.</span></h4>

<p>First of that kind of mud known by the name
of “mac.”</p>

<p>The scavengers call mud all that is <i>swept</i> from
the granite or wood pavements, in contradistinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to “mac,” which is both <i>scraped</i> and swept on the
macadamized roads. The mud is usually carted
apart from the “mac,” but some contractors cause
their men to shovel every kind of dirt they meet
with into the same cart.</p>

<p>The introduction of Mac Adam’s system of road-making
into the streets of London called into
existence a new element in what is accounted street
refuse. Until of late years little attention was
paid to “Mac,” for it was considered in no way distinct
from other kinds of street-dirt, nor as being
likely to possess properties which might adapt it
for any other use than that of a component part
of agricultural manure.</p>

<p>“Mac” is found principally on the roads from
which it derives its name, and is, indeed, the
grinding and pounding of the imbedded pieces of
granite, which are the staple of those roads. It
is, perhaps, the most adhesive street-dirt known,
as respects the London specimen of it; for the
exceeding traffic works and kneads it into a paste
which it is difficult to remove from the texture of
any garment splashed or soiled with it.</p>

<p>“Mac” is carted away by the scavengers in great
quantities, being shovelled, in a state of more or
less fluidity or solidity, according to the weather,
from the road-side into their carts. Quantities
are also swept with the rain into the drains of
the streets, and not unfrequently quantities are
found deposited in the sewers.</p>

<p>The following passage from “Sanatory Progress,”
a work before alluded to, cites the opinion
of Lord Congleton as to the necessity of continually
removing the mud from roads. I may
add that Lord Congleton’s work on road-making is of
high authority, and has frequently been appealed
to in parliamentary discussions, inquiries, and
reports on the subject.</p>

<p>“The late Lord Congleton (Sir Henry Parnell)
stated before a Committee of the House of
Commons, in June, 1838, ‘a road should be
cleansed from time to time, so as <i>never</i> to have
half an inch of mud upon it; and this is particularly
necessary to be attended to where the materials
are <i>weak</i>; for, if the surface be not kept clean, so
as to admit of its becoming dry in the intervals
between showers of rain, it will be rapidly worn
away.’ How truly,” adds the Report, “is his
Lordship’s opinion verified every day on the macadamized
roads in and around London! * * *
* * * The horse-manure and other filth are
there allowed to accumulate, and to be carried
about by the horses and carriage-wheels; the
road is formed into cavities and mud-hollows,
which, being wetted by the rain and the constantly
plying <i>watering-carts</i>, retain the same.
Thus, not only are vast quantities of offensive
mud formed, but puddles and <i>pools of water</i> also;
which water, not being allowed to run off to the
side gutter, by declivity, owing to the <i>mud embankments</i>
which surround it, naturally <i>percolates
through the surface of the road, dissolving and
loosening the soft earthy matrix</i> by which the
broken granite is surrounded and fixed.”</p>

<p>The quantity of “mac” produced is the next
consideration, and in endeavouring to ascertain this
there are no specific data, though there are what,
under other circumstances, might be called circumstantial
or inferential evidence.</p>

<p>I have shown both the length of the streets
and roads and the proportion which might be
pronounced macadamized ways in the Metropolis
Proper. But as in the macadamized proportion
many thoroughfares cannot be strictly considered
as yielding “mac,” I will assume that the roads
and streets producing this kind of dirt, more or less
fully, are 1200 miles in length.</p>

<p>On the busier macadamized roads in the vicinity
of what may be called the interior of London, it is
common, I was told by experienced men, in average
weather, to collect daily two cart-loads of what is
called mac, from every mile of road. The mass of
such road-produce, however, is mixed, though the
“mac” unquestionably predominates. It was
described to me as mac, general dirt, and droppings,
more than the half being “mac.” In wet
weather there is at least twenty times more “mac”
than dung scavenged; but in dry weather the
dung and other street-refuse constitute, perhaps,
somewhat less than three-fourths of each cart-load.
The “mac” in dry weather is derived
chiefly from the fluid from the watering carts
mixing with the dust, and so forming a paste
capable of being removed by the scraper of the
scavenger.</p>

<p>It may be fair to assume that every mile of the
roads in question, some of them being of considerable
width, yields at least one cart-load of “mac,”
as a daily average, Sunday of course excepted. An
intelligent man, who had the management of the
“mac” and other street collections in a contractor’s
wharf, told me that in a load of “mac” carted from
the road to any place of deposit, there was (I now
use his own words) “a good deal of water; for
there’s great difference,” he added, “in the <i>stiffness</i>
of the “mac” on different roads, that seem very
much the same to look at. But that don’t signify
a halfpenny-piece,” he said, “for if the ‘mac’ is
wanted for any purpose, and let be for a little
time, you see, sir, the water will dry up, and leave
the proper stuff. I haven’t any doubt whatever that
two loads a mile are collected in the way you’ve
been told, and that a load and a quarter of the
two is ‘mac,’ though after the water is dried up out
of it there mightn’t be much more than a load.
So if you want to calculate what the quantity of
‘mac’ is by itself, I think you had best say one
load a mile.”</p>

<p>But it is only in the more frequented approaches
to the City or the West-end, such as the
Knightsbridge-road, the New-road, the Old Kent-road,
and thoroughfares of similar character as regards
the extent of traffic, that two loads of refuse
are daily collected. On the more distant roads,
beyond the bounds traversed by the omnibuses
for instance, or beyond the roads resorted to by
the market gardeners on their way to the metropolitan
“green” markets, the supply of street-refuse
is hardly a quarter as great; one man thought
it was a third, and another only a sixth of a load
a day in quiet places.</p>

<p>Calculating then, in order to be within the mark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that the macadamized roads afford daily two
loads of dirt per mile, and reckoning the great
macadamized streets at 100 miles in length, we
have the following <span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>To this amount must be added the quantity
supplied by the more distant and less frequented
roads situate within the precincts of the Metropolis

less than that of the roads of greater traffic.
Some of the more quiet thoroughfares, I should
add, are not scavenged more than once a week,
and some less frequently; but on some there is
considerable traffic.</p>

<p>Thus upwards of 74,000 cart-loads of “mac”
are, at a low computation, annually scraped and

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far as to the <i>quantity</i> of “mac” collected,
and now as to its <i>uses</i>.</p>

<p>“‘Mac,’ or <i>Macadam</i>,” says one of Mr.
Cochrane’s Reports, “is a grand prize to the
scavenging contractor, who finds ready vend and
a high price for it among the builders and brick-makers.
Those who <i>paid</i> for the road&mdash;and
their surveyors, <i>possibly</i>&mdash;know nothing of its
value, or of their own loss by its removal from
the road; they consider it in the light of <i>dirt</i>&mdash;<i>offensive</i>
dirt&mdash;and are glad to <i>pay</i> the scavenger
for carrying it away! When the <i>broom</i> comes,
the scavenger’s men take care to go <i>deep</i> enough;
and many of them are, moreover, instructed to
keep the ‘<i>mac</i>’ as free from admixture with
foreign substances as possible; for, though cattle-dung
be valuable enough in itself, the ‘<i>mac</i>’ loses
<i>its</i> value to the builder and brickmaker by being
<i>mixed with it</i>. Indeed, both are valuable for
their respective uses if kept separate, not otherwise.”</p>

<p>On my first making inquiries as to the uses and
value of “mac,” I was frequently told that it was
utterly valueless, and that great trouble and expense
were incurred in merely getting rid of it.
That this is the case with many contractors is,
doubtlessly, the fact; for now, unless the “mac,”
or, rather, the general road-dirt, be ordered, or a
market for it be assured, it must be got rid of
without a remuneration. Even when the contractor
can shoot the “mac” in his own yard, and
keep it there for a customer, there is the cost of
re-loading and re-carting; a cost which a customer
requiring to use it at any distance may not choose
to incur. Great quantities of “mac,” therefore, are
wasted; and more would be wasted, were there
places to waste it in.</p>

<p>Let me, therefore, before speaking of the uses
and sale of it, point out some of the reasons for
this wasting of the “mac” with other street-dirt. In
the first place, the weight of a cart-load of street-refuse
of any kind is usually estimated at a ton;
but I am assured that the weight of a cart-load
of “stiff mac” is a ton and a quarter at the least;
and this weight becomes so trying to a scavenger’s
horse, as the day’s work advances, that the contractor,
to spare the animal, is often glad to get
rid of the “mac” in any manner and without any
remuneration. Thousands of loads of “mac,” or
rather of mixed street-dirt, have for this, and
other reasons, been thrown away; and no small
quantity has been thrown down the gulley-holes,
to find its way into that main metropolitan sewer,
the Thames. Of this matter, however, I shall
have to speak hereafter.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that it is common for contractors
to represent the “mac” they collect as
being utterly valueless, and indeed an incumbrance.
The “mixed mac,” as I have said, may
be so. Some contractors urge, especially in their
bargains with the parish board, that all kinds of
street dirt are not only worthless, but expensive
to be got rid of. Five or six years ago, this was
urged very strenuously, for then there was what
was accounted a combination among the contractors.
The south-west district of St. Pancras,
until within the last six years, <i>received</i> from the
contractor for the public scavengery, 100<i>l.</i> for the
year’s aggregation of street and house dirt. Since
then, however, they have had to pay him 500<i>l.</i>
for removing it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the reluctance of some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
contractors to give information on this, or indeed
any subject connected with their trade, I have
ascertained from indubitable authority, that “mac”
is disposed of in the following manner. Some,
but this is mostly the mixed kind, is got rid of
in <i>any</i> manner; it has even been diluted with
water so as to be driven down the drains. Some
is mixed with the general street ordure&mdash;about a
quarter of “mac,” I was told, to three-quarters of
dung and street mud&mdash;and shipped off in barges
as manure. Some is given to builders, when they
require it for the foundations of any edifices that
are “handy,” or rather it is carted thither for a
nominal price, such as a trifle as beer-money for
the men. Some, however, is <i>sold</i> for the same
purpose, the contractors alleging that the charge
is merely for cartage. Some, again, is given away
or sold (with the like allegation) for purposes of
levelling, of filling up cavities, or repairing unevennesses
in any ground where improvements are
being carried on; and, finally, some is sold to
masons, plasterers, and brickmakers, for the purposes
of their trade.</p>

<p>Even for such purposes as “filling up,” there
must be in the “mixed mac” supplied, at least a
considerable preponderance of the pure material,
or there would not be, as I heard it expressed, a
sufficient “setting” for what was required.</p>

<p>As a set-off to what is sold, however, I may
here state that 30<i>s.</i> has been paid for the privilege
of depositing a barge-load of mixed street dirt in
Battersea-fields, merely to get rid of it.</p>

<p>The principal use of the unmixed “mac” is as a
component part of the mortar, or lime, of the
mason in the exterior, and of the plasterer in the
interior, construction of buildings, and as an ingredient
of the mill in brick-grounds.</p>

<p>The accounts I received of the properties of
“mac” from the vendors of it, were very contradictory.
One man, until lately connected with
its sale, informed me that as far as his own experience
extended, “mac” was most in demand
among scamping builders, and slop brickmakers,
who looked only to what was cheap. To a
notorious “scamper,” he one morning sent three
cart-loads of “mac” at 1<i>s.</i> a load, all to be used in
the erection of the skeleton of one not very large
house; and he believed that when it was used
instead of sand with lime, it was for inferior work
only, and was mixed, either for masons’ or plasterers’
work, with bad, low-priced mortar. Another
man, with equal knowledge of the trade, however,
represented “mac” as a most valuable article for
the builder’s purposes, it was “so <i>binding</i>,” and this
he repeated emphatically. A working builder
told me that “mac” was as good as the best sand;
it made the mortar “hang,” and without either
that or sand, the lime would “brittle” away.</p>

<p>“Mac” may be said to be composed of pulverised
granite and rain water. Granite is composed of
quartz, felspar, and mica, each in granular crystals.
Hence, alumina being clay, and silex a substance
which has a strong tendency to enter into combination
with the lime of the mortar, the pulverizing
of granite tends to produce a substance which has
necessarily great binding and indurating properties.</p>

<p>From this reduction of “mac” to its elements,
it is manifest that it possesses qualities highly
valuable in promoting the cohesive property of
mortar, so that, were greater attention paid to its
collection by the scavenger, there would, in all
probability, be an improved demand for the article,
for I find that it is already used in the prosecution
of some of the best masons’ work. On this head
I can cite the authority of a gentleman, at once a
scientific and practical architect, who said to
me,&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Mac’ is used by many respectable builders for
making mortar. The objection to it is, that it
usually contains much extraneous decaying matter.”</p>

<p>Increased care in the collection of the material
would, perhaps, remove this cause of complaint.</p>

<p>I heard of one West-end builder, employing
many hands, however, who had totally or partially
discontinued the use of “mac,” as he had met with
some which he considered showed itself <i>brittle</i> in
the plastering of walls.</p>

<p>“Mac,” is pounded, and sometimes sifted, when
required for use, and is then mixed and “worked
up” with the lime for mortar, in the same way as
sand. By the brickmakers it is mixed with the
clay, ground, and formed into bricks in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>Of the proportion sold to builders, plasterers,
and brickmakers, severally, I could learn no precise
particulars. The general opinion appears to
be, that “mac” is sold most to brickmakers, and that
it would find even a greater sale with them, were
not brick-fields becoming more and more remote.
I moreover found it universally admitted, that
“mac” was in less demand&mdash;some said by one-half&mdash;than
it was five or six years back.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are the <i>uses</i> of “mac,” and we now come to
the question of its <i>value</i>.</p>

<p>The price of the purer “mac” seems, from the
best information I can procure, to have varied considerably.
It is now generally cheap. I did not
hear any very sufficing reason advanced to account
for the depreciation, but one of the contractors expressed
an opinion that this was owing to the
“disturbed” state of the trade. Since the passing
of the Sanitary Bill, the contractors for the public
scavengery have been prevented “shooting” any
valueless street-dirt, or dirt “not worth carriage”
in convenient waste-places, as they were once in
the habit of doing. Their yards and wharfs are
generally full, so that, to avoid committing a
nuisance, the contractor will not unfrequently
sell his “mac” at reduced rates, and be glad thus to
get rid of it. To this cause especially Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
attributed the deterioration in the price of “mac,”
but if he had convenience, he told me, and any
change was made in the present arrangements, he
would not scruple to store 1000 loads for the demands
of next summer, as a speculation. I am of
opinion, moreover, notwithstanding what seemed
something very like unanimity of opinion on the
part of the sellers of “mac,” that what is given
or thrown away is usually, if not always, <i>mixed</i>
or inferior “mac,” and that what is sold at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
lowest rate is only a degree or two better; unless,
indeed, it be under the immediate pressure of some
of the circumstances I have pointed out, as want
of room, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On inquiring the price of “mac,” I believe the
answer of a vendor will almost invariably be
found to be “a shilling a load;” a little further inquiry,
however, shows that an extra sum may have
to be paid. A builder, who gave me the information,
asked a parish contractor the price of “mac.”
The contractor at once offered to supply him with
500 loads at 1<i>s.</i> a load, if the “mac” were ordered
beforehand, and could be shot at once; but it
would be 6<i>d.</i> a mile extra if delivered a mile out
of the mac-seller’s parish circuit, or more than a
mile from his yard; while, if extra care were to
be taken in the collection of the “mac,” it would be
2<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>, 4<i>d.</i>, or 6<i>d.</i> a load higher. This, it must
be understood, was the price of “<i>wet</i> mac.”</p>

<p>Good “<i>dry</i> mac,” that is to say, “mac” ready
for use, is sold to the builder or the brickmaker
at from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> the load; 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or
something very near it, being now about an
average price. It is dried in the contractor’s yard
by being exposed to the sun, or it is sometimes
protected from the weather by a shed, while being
dried. More wet “mac” would be shot for the
trade, and kept until dry, but for want of room in
the contractors’ yards and wharfs; for “mac” must
give way to the more valuable dung, and the dust
and ashes from the bins. The best “mac” is sometimes
described as “country mac,” that is to say,
it is collected from those suburban roads where it
is likely to be little mixed with dung, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A contractor told me that during the last
twelve months he had sold 300 loads of “mac;”
he had no account of what he had given away,
to be rid of it, or of what he had sold at nominal
prices. Another contractor, I was told by his
managing man, sold last year about 400 loads.
But both these parties are “in a large way,”
and do not supply the data upon which to found
a calculation as to an average yearly sale; for
though in the metropolis there are, according to
the list I have given in p. <a href="#Page_167">167</a> of the present
volume, 63 contracts, for cleansing the metropolis,
without including the more remote suburbs,
such as Greenwich, Lewisham, Tooting, Streatham,
Ealing, Brentford, and others&mdash;still some of the
districts contracted for yield no “mac” at all.</p>

<p>From what I consider good authority, I may
venture upon the following moderate computation
as to the quantity of “mac” sold last year.</p>

<p>Estimating the number of contracts for cleansing
the more central parishes at 35, and adding 20
for all the outlying parishes of the metropolis&mdash;in
some of which the supply of road “mac” is very
fine, and by no means scarce&mdash;it may be accurate
enough to state that, out of the 55 individual contracts,
300 loads of “mac” were sold by each in
the course of last year. This gives 16,500 loads
of “mac” disposed of per annum. It may, moreover,
be a reasonable estimate to consider this “mac,” wet
and dry together, as fetching 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a load, so that
we have for the sum realized the following
<span class="lock">result:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>16,500 loads of “mac,” at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per load</td><td>£1237</td><td>10</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It may probably be considered by the contractors
that 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is too high an average of price
per load: if the price be minimized the result
will <span class="lock">be&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>16,500 loads of “mac,” at 1<i>s.</i> per load</td><td>£825</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Then if we divide the first estimate among the
55 contractors, we find that they receive upwards
of 22<i>l.</i> each; the second estimate gives nearly
15<i>l.</i> each.</p>

<p>I repeat, that in this inquiry I can but approximate.
One gentleman told me he thought the
quantity of “mac” thus sold in the year was twice
1600 loads; another asserted that it was not 1000.
I am assured, however, that my calculation does
not exceed the truth.</p>

<p>I have given the full quantity of “mac,” as nearly,
I believe, as it can be computed, to be yielded by the
metropolitan thoroughfares; the surplusage, after
deducting the 1600 loads sold, must be regarded as
consisting of mixed, and therefore useless, “mac;”
that is to say, “mac” rendered so <i>thin</i> by continuous
wet weather, that it is little worth; “mac” wasted
because it is not storeable in the contractor’s
yard; and “mac” used as a component part of a
barge-load of manure.</p>

<p>In the course of my inquiries I heard it very
generally stated that until five or six years ago
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> might be considered a regular price for a
load of “mac,” while 4<i>s.</i>, 5<i>s.</i>, or even 6<i>s.</i> have been
paid to one contractor, according to his own account,
for the better kind of this commodity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Mud of the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>The dirt yielded by a macadamized road, no
matter what the composition, is always termed
by the scavengers “<i>mac</i>;” what is yielded by a
granite-paved way is always “<i>mud</i>.” Mixed mud
and “mac” are generally looked upon as useless.</p>

<p>I inquired of one man, connected with a contractor’s
wharf, if he could readily distinguish the
difference between “mac” and other street or
mixed dirts, and he told me that he could do so,
more especially when the stuff was sufficiently
dried or set, at a glance. “If mac was darker,”
he said, “it always looked brighter than other
street-dirts, as if all the colour was not ground
out of the stone.” He pointed out the different
kinds, and his definition seemed to me not a bad
one, although it may require a practised eye to
make the distinction readily.</p>

<p>Street-mud is only partially mud, for mud is
earthy particles saturated with water, and in the
composition of the scavenger’s street-mud are
dung, general refuse (such as straw and vegetable
remains), and the many things which in poor
neighbourhoods are still thrown upon the pavement.</p>

<p>In the busier thoroughfares of the metropolis&mdash;apart
from the City, where there is no macadamization
requiring notice&mdash;it is almost impossible to
keep street “mac” and mud distinct, even if the
scavengers cared more to do so than is the case at
present; for a waggon, or any other vehicle, en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>tering
a street paved with blocks of wrought granite
from a macadamized road must convey “mac”
amongst mud; both “mac” and mud, however, as
I have stated, are the most valuable separately.</p>

<p>In a Report on the Supply of Water, Appendix
No. III., Mr. Holland, Upper Stamford-street,
Waterloo-road, is stated to have said, in reply to
a question on the subject:&mdash;“Suppose the inhabitants
of one parish are desirous of having
their streets in good order and clean: unless the
adjoining districts concur, a great and unjust expense
is imposed upon the cleaner parish; because
every vehicle which passes from a dirty on to a
clean street carries dirt from the former to the
latter, and renders cleanliness more difficult and
expensive. The inhabitants of London have an
interest in the condition of other streets besides
those of their own parish. Besides the inhabitants
of Regent-street, for instance, all the riders
in the 5000 vehicles that daily pass through that
great thoroughfare are affected by its condition;
and the inhabitants of Regent-street, who have to
bear the cost of keeping that street in good repair
and well cleansed, <i>for others’ benefit as well as for
their own</i>, may fairly feel aggrieved if they do
not experience the benefits of good and clean
streets when they go into other districts.”</p>

<p>In the admixture of street-dirt there is this
material difference&mdash;the dung, which spoils good
“mac,” makes good mud more valuable.</p>

<p>After having treated so fully of the road-produce
of “mac,” there seems no necessity to say more
about mud than to consider its quantity, its value,
and its uses.</p>

<p>In the Haymarket, which is about an eighth of
a mile in length, and 18 yards in width, a load
and a half of street-mud is collected daily (Sundays
excepted), take the year through. As a
farmer or market-gardener will give 3<i>s.</i> a load for
common street-mud, and cart it away at his own
cost, we find that were all this mud sold separately,
at the ordinary rate, the yearly receipt
for one street alone would be 70<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> This
public way, however, furnishes no criterion of the
general mud-produce of the metropolis. We must,
therefore, adopt some other basis for a calculation;
and I have mentioned the Haymarket merely to
show the great extent of street-dirt accruing in a
largely-frequented locality.</p>

<p>But to obtain other data is a matter of no small
difficulty where returns are not published nor even
kept. I have, however, been fortunate enough to
obtain the assistance of gentlemen whose public
employment has given them the best means of
forming an accurate opinion.</p>

<p>The street mud from the Haymarket, it has
been positively ascertained, is 1&frac14; load each wet day
the year through. Fleet-street, Ludgate-hill, Cheapside,
Newgate-street, the “off” parts of St. Paul’s
Church-yard, Cornhill, Leadenhall-street, Bishopsgate-street,
the free bridges, with many other
places where locomotion never ceases, are, in proportion
to their width, as productive of street mud
as the Haymarket.</p>

<p>Were the Haymarket a mile in length, it would
supply, at its present rate of traffic, to the scavenger
6 loads of street mud daily, or 36 loads for the
scavenger’s working week. In this yield, however,
I am assured by practical men, the Haymarket
is six times in excess of the average streets;
and when compared with even “great business”
thoroughfares, of a narrow character, such as
Watling-street, Bow-lane, Old-change, and other
thoroughfares off Cheapside and Cornhill, the
produce of the Haymarket is from 10 to 40 per
cent. in excess.</p>

<p>I am assured, however, and especially by a
gentleman who had looked closely into the matter&mdash;as
he at one time had been engaged in preparing
estimates for a projected company purposing to
deal with street-manures&mdash;that the 50 miles of
the City may be safely calculated as yielding
daily 1&frac12; load of street mud per mile. Narrow
streets&mdash;Thames-street for instance, which is
about three-quarters of a mile long&mdash;yield from 2&frac12;
to 3&frac12; loads daily, according to the season; but a
number of off-streets and open places, such as Long-alley,
Alderman’s-walk, America-square, Monument-yard,
Bridgewater-square, Austin-friars, and
the like, are either streets without horse-thoroughfares,
or are seldom traversed by vehicles. If, then,
we calculate that there are 100 miles of paved streets
adjoining the City, and yielding the same quantity
of street mud daily as the above estimate, and
200 more miles in the less central parts of the
metropolis, yielding only half that quantity, we
find the following daily sum during the wet <span class="lock">season:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The great sale for this mud, perhaps nineteen-twentieths,
is from the barges. A barge
of street-manure, about one-fourth (more or
less) “mac,” or rather “mac” mixed with its street
proportion of dung, &amp;c., and three-fourths mud,
dung, &amp;c., contains from 30 to 40 tons, or as
many loads. These manure barges are often to
be seen on the Thames, but nearly three-fourths
of them are found on the canals, especially the
Paddington, the Regent’s, and the Surrey, these
being the most immediately connected with the
interior part of the metropolis. A barge-load of
this manure is usually sold at from 5<i>l.</i> to 6<i>l.</i>
Calculating its average weight at 35 tons, and its
average sale at 5<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, the price is rather more
than 3<i>s.</i> a load. “Common street mud,” I have
been informed on good authority, “fetches 3<i>s.</i> per
load from the farmer, when he himself carts it
away.”</p>

<p>The price of the barge-load of manure is tolerably
uniform, for the quality is generally the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Some of the best, because the cleanest, street mud&mdash;as
it is mixed only with horse-dung&mdash;is obtained
from the wood streets, but this mode of
pavement is so circumscribed that the contractors
pay no regard to its manure produce, as a general
rule, and mix it carelessly with the rest. Such,
at least, is the account they themselves give, and
they generally represent that the street manure
is, owing to the outlay for cartage and boatage,
little remunerative to them at the prices they
obtain; notwithstanding, they are paid to remove
it from the streets. Indeed, I heard of one contractor
who was said to be so dissatisfied with the
demand for, and the prices fetched by, his street-manure,
that he has rented a few acres not far
from the Regent’s Canal, to test the efficacy of
street dirt as a fertilizer, and to ascertain if to cultivate
might not be more profitable than to sell.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Surface-Water of the Streets
of London.</span></h3>

<p>The consideration of what Professor Way has
called the “street waters” of the metropolis, is
one of as great moment as any of those I have
previously treated in my details concerning street
refuse, whether “mac,” mud, or dung. Indeed,
water enters largely into the composition of the
two former substances, while even the street
dung is greatly affected by the rain.</p>

<p>The <i>feeders</i> of the street, as regards the street
surface-water, are principally the rains. I will
first consider the amount of surface-water supplied
by the rain descending upon the area of the
metropolis: upon the roofs of the houses, and
the pavement of the streets and roads.</p>

<p>The depth of rain falling in London in the

and calculations of the most eminent meteorologists,

<p>The rainfall in London, according to a ten
years’ average of the Royal Society’s observations,
amounts to 23 inches; in 1848 it was as high as
28 inches, and in 1847 as low as 15 inches. The
depth of rain annually falling near London is
stated by Mr. Luke Howard to be, on an average
of 23 years (1797-1819), as much as 25·179
inches. Mr. Daniell says that the average annual
fall is 23⅒ inches. The mean of the observations
made at Greenwich between the years 1838
and 1849 was 24·84 inches.</p>

<p>The following extract from an account of the
“Soft Water Springs of the Surrey Sands,” by
the Hon. Wm. Napier, is interesting.</p>

<p>“The amount of rainfall,” says the Author,
“is taken from a register kept at the Royal
Military College, Sandhurst, from the year 1818
to 1846.</p>

<p>“The average fall of the last 15 years, during
which time the register appears to have been
correctly kept, is 22·64 inches. I consider this
to be a very low estimate, however, of the
average rainfall over the whole district. The fall
on the ranges of the Hindhead must considerably
exceed this amount, for I find in White’s ‘Selborne,’
a register for ten years at that place;
the greatest fall being in 1782, 50·26 inches, the
lowest, in 1788, 22·50 inches, and the average of
all 37·58 inches. The elevation of the Hindhead
is about 800 feet above mean tide.</p>

<p>“With reference to the measurement of rainfall,
it is difficult indeed to obtain more than a
very approximate idea for a given district of not
very great extent; the method of measurement is
so uncertain, as liable to be affected by currents
of air and evaporation. It is well known that
elevated regions attract by condensation more
rain than low lands, and yet a rain-gauge placed
on the ground will register a greater fall than
one placed immediately, and even at a small
height, above it.</p>

<p>“M. Arago has shown from 12 years’ observations
at Paris, that the average depth of rain on
the terrace of the Observatory was 19·88 inches,
while 30 yards lower it was 22·21 inches. Dr.
Heberden has shown the rainfall on the top of
Westminster Cathedral, during a certain period to
be only 12·09 inches, and at a lower level on the
top of a house in the neighbourhood to be 22·608
inches. This fact has been observed all over the
world, and I can only account for it as arising
partly from the greater amount of condensation the
nearer the earth’s surface, but probably also from
currents of air depriving a rain-gauge at a high
elevation of its fair share.”</p>

<p>The results of the above observations, as to the
yearly quantity of rain falling in the metropolis,
may be summed up as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The “mean mean,” or average of all the
averages here given is within a fraction the
average of the Royal Society’s Observations for
10 years, and this is the quantity that I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
adopt in my calculations as to the gross volume
of rain falling over the entire area of London.</p>

<p>I have shown, by a detail of the respective
districts in the Registrar General’s department,
that the metropolis contains 74,070 statute acres.
Every square inch of this extent, as garden,
arable, or pasture ground, or as road or street,
or waste place, or house, or inclosed yard or lawn,
of course receives its modicum of rain. Each
acre comprises 6,272,640 square inches, and we
thus find the whole metropolitan area to contain
a number of square inches, almost beyond the
terms of popular arithmetic, and best expressible
in figures.</p>

<p>Area of metropolis in square inches,
464,614,444,800. Now, multiplying these four
hundred and sixty four thousand, six hundred and
fourteen millions, four hundred and forty-four
thousand, eight hundred square inches, by 23,
the number of inches of rain falling every year
in London, we have the following <span class="lock">result:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Total quantity of rain falling yearly in the metropolis,
10,686,132,230,400 cubic inches.</p>

<p>Then, as a fraction more than 277&frac14; cubic
inches of water represent a weight of 10 lbs.,
and an admeasurement of a gallon, we have the
following further <span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Hence it would appear that the rain falling in
London in the course of the year is <i>rather more
than double that of the entire quantity of water annually
supplied to the metropolis by mechanical
means</i>, the rain-water being to the other as 2·005
to 1·000.</p>

<p>Now, in order to ascertain what proportion of
the entire volume of rain comes under the denomination
of street surface-water, we must first
deduct from the gross quantity falling the amount
said to be caught, and which, in contradistinction
to that mechanically <i>supplied</i> to the houses of the
metropolis is termed, “catch.” This is estimated
at 1,000,000 gallons per diem, or 365,000,000
gallons yearly.</p>

<p>But we must also subtract from the gross quantity
of rain-water that which falls on the roofs as
well as on the “back premises” and yards of
houses, and is carried off directly to the drains
without appearing in the streets. This must be a
considerable proportion of the whole, since the
streets themselves, allowing them to be ten yards
wide on an average, would seem to occupy only
about one-tenth part of the entire metropolitan
area, so that the rain falling <i>directly</i> upon the public
thoroughfares will be but a tithe of the aggregate
quantity. But the surface-water of the
streets is increased largely by tributary shoots
from courts and drainless houses, and hence we
may fairly assume the <i>natural</i> supply to be
doubled by such means. At this rate the volume
of rain-water annually poured into and upon the
metropolitan thoroughfares by natural means, will
be between five and six thousand millions of
gallons, or one hundred times the quantity that is
daily supplied to the houses of the metropolis by
mechanical agency.</p>

<p>Still only a part of this quantity appears in the
form of surface-water, for a considerable portion of
it is absorbed by the ground on which it falls&mdash;especially
in dry weather&mdash;serving either to “lay
the dust,” or to convert it into mud. Due regard,
therefore, being had to all these considerations,
we cannot, consistently with that caution which is
necessary in all statistical inquiries, estimate the surface-water
of the London streets at more than one
thousand millions of gallons per annum, or twenty
times the daily mechanical supply to the houses
of the entire metropolis, and which it has been
asserted is sufficient to exhaust a lake covering the
area of St. James’s-park, 30 inches in depth.</p>

<p>The quantity of water annually poured upon the
streets in the process of what is termed “watering”
amounts, according to the returns of the Board of
Health, to 275,000,000 gallons per annum! But
as this seldom or never assumes the form of street
surface-water, it need form no part of the present
estimate.</p>

<p>What proportion of the thousand million gallons
of “slop dirt” produced annually in the London
streets is carried off down the drains, and what
proportion is ladled up by the scavengers, I have
no means of ascertaining, but that vast quantities
run away into the sewers and there form large
deposits of mud, everything tends to prove.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovick, on being asked, “How many loads
of deposit have been removed in any one week in
the Surrey and Kent district? What is the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
quantity of deposit removed in any one week in
the whole of the metropolitan district?” replied:</p>

<p>“It is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain
correctly the quantity removed, owing to the
variety of forms of sewers and the ever-varying
forms assumed by the deposit from the action of
varying volumes of water; but I have had observations
made on the rate of accumulation, from
which I have been enabled roughly to approximate
it. In one week, in the Surrey and Kent district,
about 1000 yards were removed. In one week,
in the whole of the metropolitan districts, including
the Surrey and Kent district, between 4000
and 5000 yards were removed; but in portions of
the districts these operations were not in progress.”</p>

<p>It is not here stated of what the deposit consisted,
but there is no doubt that “mac” from the
streets formed a great portion of it. Neither
is it stated what period of time had sufficed for
the accumulation; but it is evident enough that
such deposits in the course of a year must be very
great.</p>

<p>The street surface-water has been analyzed by
Professor Way, and found to yield different constituents
according to the different pavements from
which it has been discharged. The results are as

<p>“The influence of the quality of the paving on
the composition of the drainage water,” says Professor
Way, “is well seen in the specimens Nos.
10, 6, and 11, all of them from Oxford-street, the
traffic being described as ‘Great.’</p>

<p>“The quantity of soluble salts is here found to
be greatest from the granite matter from the macadamized
road, and very inconsiderable from the
wood pavement.</p>

<p>“The same relation between the granite and
macadam pavement seems to hold good in the
other instances; the granite for any quality of
traffic affording more soluble salts to the water
than the macadam.</p>

<p>“The ballasted pavement holds a position intermediate
between the macadam and the wood,
giving more soluble salts than the wood, but less
than the macadam.</p>

<p>“The quantity of solid (insoluble) matter in the
different samples of water, <i>which is a measure of
the mechanical waste of the different kinds of
pavement</i>, appears also to follow the same relation
as that of the soluble salts; that is to say, granite
greatest, next macadam, then ballasted, and,
lastly, wood pavement, which affords a quantity
of solid deposit almost too small to deserve
notice.</p>

<p>“The influence of the quality of traffic on the
composition of the different specimens of drainage
is well marked in nearly all cases; the greatest
amount of matter both insoluble and soluble being
found in the water obtained from the streets of
great traffic.</p>

<p>“The following table shows the composition
of the soluble salts of four specimens, two of them
being from the granite, and two from the macadam
pavement.</p>

<p>“It appears from the table that the granite
furnishes little or no magnesia to the water, whilst
the quantity from the macadam is considerable.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the quantity of potash
is far greatest in the water derived from the
granite.</p>

<p>“The traffic, as was before seen, has a very
great influence on the quantity of the soluble
salts. It seems also to influence their composition,
for we find no carbonates either in the water
from the granite, or that from the macadam, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the traffic is little; whereas, when it is great,
carbonates of lime and potash are found in the
water in large quantity, a circumstance which is
no doubt attributable to the action of decaying
organic matter on the mineral substances of the
pavement.</p>

<p>“The insoluble matter in the waters consists of
the comminuted material of the road itself, with
small fragments of straw and broken dung.</p>

<p>“The quantity of soluble salts (especially of
salts of potash) in many of these samples of water
is quite as great, and in some cases greater, than
that found in the samples of sewer-water that
have been examined; and it is open to question
and further inquiry, whether the water obtained
from the street-drainage of a crowded city might
not often be of nearly equal value as liquid manure
with the sewer-water with which it is at
present allowed to mix.”</p></div>

<p>With regard to the “ballasted pavement” mentioned
by Professor Way, I may observe that it
cannot be considered a <i>street</i>-pavement, unless
exceptionally. It is formed principally of Thames
ballast mixed with gravel, and is used in the
construction of what are usually private or pleasure
walks, such as the “gravel walks” in the
inclosures of some of the parks, and upon Primrose-hill,
&amp;c.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Master Scavengers in former Times.</span></h3>

<p>Degraded as the occupation of the scavenger
may be in public estimation; though “I’d rather
sweep the streets” may be a common remark
expressive of the lowest deep of humiliation among
those who never handled a besom in their lives;
yet the very existence of a large body who are
public cleansers betokens civilization. Their
occupation, indeed, was defined, or rather was
established or confirmed, in the early periods of
our history, when municipal regulations were a
sort of charter of civic protection, of civic liberties,
and of general progress.</p>

<p>The noun <i>Scavenger</i> is said by lexicographers
to be derived from the German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schaben</i>, to shave
or scrape, “applied to those who scrape and clear
away the filth from public streets or other places.”
The more direct derivation, however, is from the
Danish verb <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">skaver</i>, the Saxon equivalent of
which is <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sceafan</i>, whence the English <i>shave</i>.
Formerly the word was written <i>Scavager</i>, and
meant simply one who was engaged in removing
the <i>Scrapeage</i> or <i>Rakeage</i> (the working men, it
will be seen, were termed also “rakers”) from the
surface of the streets. Hence it would appear
that there is no authority for the verb to scavenge,
which has lately come into use. The term from
which the personal substantive is directly made,
is <i>scavage</i>, a word formed from the verb in the same
manner as <i>sewage</i> and <i>rubbage</i> (now fashionably
corrupted into rubbish), and meaning the refuse
which is or should be scraped away from the
roads. The Latin equivalent from the Danish
verb <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">skave</i>, is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scabere</i>.</p>

<p>I believe that the first mention of a scavenger
in our earlier classical literature, is by Bishop
Hall, one of the lights of the Reformation, in one
of his “Satires.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“To see the Pope’s blacke knight, a cloaked frere,</div>
      <div class="verse">Sweating in the channel <i>like a scavengere</i>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many similar passages from the old poets and
dramatists might be adduced, but I will content
myself with one from the “Martial Maid”
of Beaumont and Fletcher, as bearing immediately
on the topic I have to <span class="lock">discuss:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Do I not know thee for the alguazier,</div>
      <div class="verse">Whose dunghil <i>all the parish scavengers</i></div>
      <div class="verse">Could never rid.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Johnson defines a scavenger to be “a petty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
magistrate, whose province is to keep the streets
clean;” and in the earlier times, certainly the
scavenger was an officer to whom a certain
authority was deputed, as to beadles and others.</p>

<p>One or two of these officials were appointed,
according to the municipal or by-laws of the City
of London, not to each parish, but to each ward.
Of course, in the good old days, nothing could be
done unless under “the sanction of an oath,” and
the scavengers were sworn accordingly on the
Gospel, the following being the form as given in
the black letter of the laws relating to the city in
the time of Henry VIII.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>The Oath of Scavagers, or Scavengers, of the
Ward.</i></p>

<p>“Ye shal swear, That ye shal wel and diligently
oversee that the pavements in every Ward be wel
and rightfully repaired, and not haunsed to the
noyaunce of the neighbours; and that the Ways,
Streets, and Lanes, be kept clean from Donge and
other Filth, for the Honesty of the City. And
that all the Chimneys, Redosses, and Furnaces, be
made of Stone for Defence of Fire. And if ye
know any such ye shall shew it to the Alderman,
that he may make due Redress therefore. And
this ye shall not lene. So help you God.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>To aid the scavengers in their execution of the
duties of the office, the following among others
were the injunctions of the civic law. They indicate
the former state of the streets of London
better than any description. A “Goung (or dung)
fermour” appears to be a nightman, a dung-carrier
or bearer, the servant of the master or ward
scavenger.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No Goungfermour shall spill any ordure in the
Street, under pain of Thirteen Shillings and Four
Pence.</p>

<p>“No Goungfermour shall carry any ordure till
after nine of the clock in the Night, under pain of
Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence. No man
shall cast any urine boles, or ordure boles, into
the Streets by Day or Night, <i>afore the Hour of
nine in the Night</i>. And also he shall not cast it
out, but bring it down and lay it in the Canel,
under Pain of Three Shillings and Four Pence.
And if he do so cast it upon any Person’s Head,
the Person to have a lawful Recompense, <i>if he
have hurt thereby</i>.</p>

<p>“No man shall bury any Dung, or Goung,
within the Liberties of this City, under Pain of
Forty Shillings.”</p></div>

<p>I will not dwell on the state of things which
caused such enactments to be necessary, or on the
barbarism of the law which ordered a lawful recompense
to any person assailed in the manner
intimated, only when he had “hurt thereby.”</p>

<p>These laws were for the government of the city,
where a body of scavengers was sometimes called
a “street-ward.” Until about the reign of Charles
II., however, to legislate concerning such matters
for the city was to legislate for the metropolis, as
Southwark was then more or less under the city
jurisdiction, and the houses of the nobility on the
north bank of the Thames (the Strand), would
hardly require the services of a public scavenger.</p>

<p>As new parishes or districts became populous,
and established outside the city boundaries, the
authorities seem to have regulated the public
scavengery after the fashion of the city; but the
whole, in every respect of cleanliness, propriety,
regularity, or celerity, was most grievously defective.</p>

<p>Some time about the middle of the last century,
the scavengers were considered and pronounced by
the administrators or explainers of municipal law,
to be “two officers chosen yearly in each parish
in London and the suburbs, by the constables,
churchwardens, and other inhabitants,” and their
business was declared to be, that they should
“hire persons called ‘rakers,’ with carts to clean
the streets, and carry away the dirt and filth
thereof, under a penalty of 40<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>The scavengers thus appointed we should now
term surveyors. There is little reason to doubt
that in the old times the duly-appointed scavagers
or scavengers, laboured in their vocation themselves,
and employed such a number of additional
hands as they accounted necessary; but how or
when the master scavenger ceased to be a labourer,
and how or when the office became merely nominal,
I can find no information. So little attention appears
to have been paid to this really important matter,
that there are hardly any records concerning it.
The law was satisfied to lay down provisions for
street-cleansing, but to enforce these provisions
was left to chance, or to some idle, corrupt, or inefficient
officer or body.</p>

<p>Neither can I find any precise account of what
was formerly done with the dirt swept and
scraped from the streets, which seems always to
have been left to the discretion of the scavenger
to deal with as he pleased, and such is still the
case in a great measure. Some of this dirt I find,
however, promoted “the goodly nutriment of the
land” about London, and some was “delivered in
waste places apart from habitations.” These waste
places seem to have been the nuclei of the present
dust-yards, and were sometimes “presented,”
that is, they were reported by a jury of nuisances
(or under other titles), as “places of obscene resort,”
for lewd and disorderly persons, the lewd
and disorderly persons consisting chiefly of the
very poor, who came to search among the rubbish
for anything that might be valuable or saleable;
for there were frequent rumours of treasure or
plate being temporarily hidden in such places by
thieves. Some outcast wretches, moreover, slept
within the shelter of these scavengers’ places, and
occasionally a vigilant officer&mdash;even down to our
own times, or within these few years&mdash;apprehended
such wretches, charged them with destitution,
and had them punished accordingly. Much
of the street refuse thus “delivered,” especially the
“dry rubbish,” was thrown into the streets from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
houses under repair, &amp;c., (I now speak of the
past century,) and no use seems to have been made
of any part of it unless any one requiring a load
or two of rubbish chose to cart it away.</p>

<p>I have given this sketch to show what master
scavengers were in the olden times, and I now
proceed to point out what is the present condition
of the trade.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Several Modes and Characteristics
of Street-Cleansing.</span></h3>

<p>We here come to the practical part of this complex
subject. We have ascertained the length of
the streets of London&mdash;we have estimated the
amount of daily, weekly, and yearly traffic&mdash;calculated
the quantity of mud, dung, “mac,” dust,
and surface-water formed and collected annually
throughout the metropolis&mdash;we have endeavoured
to arrive at some notion as to the injury done by
all this vast amount of filth owing to what the
Board of Health has termed “imperfect scavenging,”&mdash;and
we now come to treat of the means by
which the loads of street refuse&mdash;the loads of
dust&mdash;loads of “mac” and mud, and the tons of
dung, are severally and collectively removed
throughout the year.</p>

<p>There are two distinct, and, in a measure,
diametrically opposed, methods of street-cleansing
at present in operation.</p>

<p>1. That which consists in cleaning the streets
when dirtied.</p>

<p>2. That which consists in cleaning them and
<i>keeping</i> them clean.</p>

<p>These modes of scavenging may not appear, to
those who have paid but little attention to the
matter, to be <i>very</i> widely different means of
effecting the same object. The one, however, removes
the refuse from the streets (sooner or later)
<i>after it has been formed</i>, whereas the other removes
it <i>as fast as it is formed</i>. By the latter
method the streets are never allowed to get dirty&mdash;by
the former they must be dirty before they
are cleansed.</p>

<p>The plan of street-cleansing <i>before</i> dirtied, or the
pre-scavenging system, is of recent introduction,
being the mode adopted by the “street-orderlies;”
that of cleansing after having dirtied, or the post-scavenging
system, is (so far as the more <i>general</i>
or common method is concerned) the same as
that pursued two centuries ago. I shall speak
of each of these modes in due course, beginning
with that last mentioned.</p>

<p>By the ordinary method of scavenging, the dirt
is still swept or scraped to one side of the
public way, then shovelled into a cart and conveyed
to the place of deposit. In wet weather
the dirt swept or scraped to one side is so
liquified that it is known as “slop,” and is
“lifted” into the cart in shovels hollowed like
sugar-spoons. The only change of which I have
heard in this mode of scavenging was in one of
the tools. Until about nine years ago birch, or
occasionally heather, brooms or besoms were used
by the street-sweepers, but they soon became
clogged in dirty weather, and then, as one working
scavenger explained it to me, “they scattered and
drove the dirt to the sides ’stead of making it go
right a-head as you wants it.” The material now
used for the street-sweeper’s broom is known as
“bass,” and consists of the stems or branches of
a New Zealand plant, a substance which has considerable
strength and elasticity of fibre, and both
“sweeps” and “scrapes” in the process of scavenging.
The broom itself, too, is differently constructed,
having divisions between the several insertions of
bass in the wooden block of the head, so that clogging
is less frequent, and cleaning easier, whereas
the birch broom consisted of a close mass of twigs,
and thus scattered while it swept the dirt. There
was, of course, some outcry on the part of the
“established-order-of-things” gentry among scavengers,
against the innovation, but it is now
general. As all the scavengers, no matter how
they vary in other respects, work with the brooms
described, this one mention of the change will
suffice. No doubt the cleansing of the streets is
accomplished with greater efficiency and with
greater celerity than it was, but the mere process
of manual toil is little altered.</p>

<p>In a work like the present, however, we have
more particularly to deal with the labourers engaged;
and, viewing the subject in this light, we
may arrange the several modes of street-cleansing
into the four following <span class="lock">divisions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. By paid manual-labourers, or men employed
by the contractors, and paid in the ordinary ways
of wages.</p>

<p>2. By paid “Machine”-labourers, differing from
the first only or mainly in the means by which
they attain their end.</p>

<p>3. By pauper labourers, or men employed by
the parishes in which they are set to work, and
either paid in money or in food, or maintained in
the workhouses.</p>

<p>4. By street-orderlies, or men employed by
philanthropists&mdash;a body of workmen with particular
regulations and more organized than other
scavengers.</p>

<p>By one or other of these modes of scavengery
all the public ways of the metropolis are cleansed;
and the subject is most peculiar, as including within
itself all the several varieties of labour, if we except
that of women and children&mdash;viz., manual
labour, mechanical labour, pauper labour, and philanthropic
labour.</p>

<p>By these several varieties of labour the highways
and by-ways of the entire metropolis are
cleansed, with one exception&mdash;the Mews, concerning
which a few words here may not be out of
place. <i>All</i> these localities, whether they be what
are styled Private or Gentlemen’s Mews, or Public
Mews, where stables, coach-houses, and dwelling-rooms
above them, may be taken by any
one (a good many of such places being, moreover,
public or partial thoroughfares); or whether they be
job-masters’ or cab-proprietors’ mews; are scavenged
by the occupants, for the manure is valuable. The
mews of London, indeed, constitute a world of
their own. They are tenanted by one class&mdash;coachmen
and grooms, with their wives and
families&mdash;men who are devoted to one pursuit, the
care of horses and carriages; who live and asso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>ciate
one among another; whose talk is of horses
(with something about masters and mistresses) as
if to ride or to drive were the great ends of human
existence, and who thus live as much together as
the Jews in their compulsory quarters in Rome.
The mews are also the “chambers” of unemployed
coachmen and grooms, and I am told that the very
sicknesses known in such places have their own
peculiarities. These, however, form matter for
<i>future</i> inquiry.</p>

<p>Concerning the private scavenging of the metropolitan
mews, the <i>Medical Times</i>, of July 26,
1851, contains a letter from Mr. C. Cochrane, in
which that gentleman <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It will be found, that in all the mews throughout
the metropolis, the manure produced from each
stable is packed up in a separate stack, until there
is sufficient for a load for some market-gardener or
farmer to remove. The groom or stable-man makes
an arrangement, or agreement as it is called, with
the market-gardener, to remove it at his convenience,
and a gratuity of 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per load is
usually presented to the stable-man. In some
places there are dung-pits containing the collectings
of a fortnight’s dung, which, when disturbed
for removal, casts out an offensive effluvium, as
sickening as it is disgusting to the whole neighbourhood.
In consequence of the arrangement in
question, if a third party wished to buy some of
this manure, he could not get it; and if he wished
to get rid of any by giving it away, the stable-man
would not receive it, as it would not be removed
sufficiently quick by the farmer. The result
is, that whilst the air is rendered offensive and
insalubrious, manure becomes difficult to be removed
or disposed of, and frequently is washed
away into the sewer.</p>

<p>“Of this manure there are always (at a moderate
computation) remaining daily, in the mews
and stable-yards of the metropolis, at least 2000
cart-loads.</p>

<p>“To remedy these evils, I would suggest that
a brief Act of Parliament should be passed, giving
municipal and parochial authorities the same complete
control over the manure as they have over
the ‘ashes,’ with the provision, that owners
should have the right of removing it themselves
for their own use; but if they did not do so
daily, then the control to return to the above
authorities, who should have the right of selling
it, and placing the proceeds in the parish funds.
By this simple means immense quantities of
valuable manure would be saved for the purposes
of agriculture&mdash;food would be rendered cheaper
and more abundant&mdash;more people would be employed&mdash;whilst
the metropolis would be rendered
clean, sweet, and healthy.”</p>

<p>I may dismiss this part of the subject with the
remark, that I was informed that the mews’ manure
was in regular demand and of ready sale,
being removed by the market-gardeners with
greater facility than can street-dirt, which the
contractors with the parishes prefer to vend by the
barge-load.</p>

<p>Having enumerated the four several modes of
street-cleansing, I will now proceed to point out
briefly the characteristics of each class of cleansing.
This will also denote the quality of the employers
and the nature of the employment.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Paid Manual Labourers</i> constitute the
bulk of those engaged in scavenging, and the
chief pay-masters are the contractors. Many of
these labourers consider themselves the only
“regular hands,” having been “brought up to the
business;” but unemployed or destitute labourers
or mechanics, or reduced tradesmen, will often
endeavour to obtain employment in street-sweeping;
this is the necessary evil of all <i>unskilled</i>
labour, for since every one can do it (without previous
apprenticeship), it follows that the beaten-out
artisans or discarded trade assistants, beggared
tradesmen, or reduced gentlemen, must
necessarily resort to it as their only means of independent
support; and hence the reason why
dock labour and street labour, and indeed all the
several forms of unskilled work, have a tendency to
be overstocked with hands&mdash;the <i>unskilled</i> occupations
being, as it were, the sink for all the refuse
<i>skilled</i> labour and beggared industry of the country.</p>

<p>The “contractors,” like other employers, are
separated by their men into two classes&mdash;such as,
in more refined callings, are often designated the
“honourable” and “dishonourable” traders&mdash;according
as they pay or do not pay what is reputed
“fair wages.”</p>

<p>I cannot say that I heard any especial appellation
given by the working scavengers to the
better-paying class of employers, unless it were
the expressive style of “good-’uns.” The inferior
paying class, however, are very generally known
among their work-people as “scurfs.”</p>

<p>2. <i>The Street-sweeping Machine Labourers.</i>&mdash;Of
the men employed as “attendant” scavengers,
for so they may be termed, in connection with
these mechanical and vehicular street-sweepers,
little need here be said, for they are generally of
the class of ordinary scavengers. It may, however,
be necessary to explain that each of those
machines must have the street refuse, for the
“lick-in” of the machine, swept into a straight
line wherever there is the slightest slope at the
sides of a street towards the foot-path; the same,
too, must sometimes be done, if the pavement be
at all broken, even when the progress of the
machine is, what I heard, not very appropriately,
termed “plain sailing.” Sometimes, also, men
follow the course of the street-sweeping machine,
to “sweep up” any dirt missed or scattered, as
the vehicle proceeds on a straightforward course,
for at all to diverge would be to make the labour,
where the machine alone is used, almost double.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Pauper, or Parish-employed Scavengers</i>
present characteristics peculiarly their own, as regards
open-air labour in London. They are employed
less to cleanse the streets, than to prevent
their being chargeable to the poor’s rate as out-door
recipients, or as inmates of the workhouses.
When paid, they receive a lower amount of wages
than any other scavengers, and they are sometimes
paid in food as well as in money, while a
difference may be made between the wages of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
married and of the unmarried men, and even between
the married men who have and have not
children; some, again, are employed in scavenging
without any money receipt, their maintenance in
the workhouse being considered a sufficient return
for the fruits of their toil.</p>

<p>Some of these men are feeble, some are unskilful
(even in tasks in which skill is but little
of an element), and most of them are dissatisfied
workmen. Their ranks comprise, or may comprise,
men who have filled very different situations
in life. It is mentioned in the second
edition of one of the publications of the National
Philanthropic Association, “Sanatory Progress”
(1850), “that the once high-salaried cashier of a
West-end bank died lately in St. Pancras-workhouse;&mdash;that
the architect of several of the
most fashionable West-end club-houses is now
an inmate of St. James’s-workhouse;&mdash;and that
the architect of St. Pancras’ New Church lately
died in a back garret in Somers-town.” “These
recent instances (a few out of many)” says the
writer, “prove that ‘wealth has wings,’ and that
Genius and Industry have but leaden feet, when
overtaken by Adversity. A late number of the
<i>Globe</i> newspaper states that, ‘among the police
constables on the Great Western Railway, there
are at present eight members of the Royal College
of Surgeons, and three solicitors;’&mdash;and the
<i>Limerick Examiner</i>, a few weeks ago, announced
the fact, that ‘a gentlewoman is now an inmate
of the workhouse of that city, whose husband, a
few years ago, filled the office of High Sheriff of
the county.’”</p>

<p>I do not know that either the cashier or the
architect in the two workhouses in question was
employed as a street-sweeper.</p>

<p>This second class, then, are situated differently
to the paid street-sweepers (or No. 1 of the present
division), who may be considered, more or less,
independent or self-supporting labourers, while the
paupers are, of course, dependent.</p>

<p>4. <i>The “Street Orderlies.”</i>&mdash;These men present
another distinct body. They are not merely in the
employment, but many of them are under the care,
of the National Philanthropic Association, which
was founded by, and is now under the presidency
of, Mr. Cochrane. The objects of this society, as
far as regards the street orderlies’ existence as a
class of scavengers, are sufficiently indicated in its
title, which declares it to be “For the Promotion
of Street Cleanliness and the Employment of the
Poor; so that able-bodied men may be prevented
from burthening the parish rates, and preserved
independent of workhouse alms and degradation.
Supported by the contributions of the benevolent.”</p>

<p>The street orderlies, men and boys, are paid a
fixed weekly wage, a certain sum being stopped
from those single men who reside in houses
rented for them by the association, where their
meals, washing, &amp;c., are provided. Among them
are men of many callings, and some educated and
accomplished persons.</p>

<p>The system of street orderlyism is, moreover,
distinguished by one attribute unknown to any
other mode; it is an effort, persevered in, despite
of many hindrances and difficulties, to amend our
street scavengery, indeed to reform it altogether;
so that dust and dirt may be checked in their very
origination.</p>

<p>The corporation, if I may so describe it, of
the street orderlies, presents characteristics, again,
varying from the other orders of what can only
be looked upon either as the self-supporting or
pauper workers.</p>

<p>These, then, are the several modes or methods of
street-scavengery, and they show the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>


<h3><i><span class="smcap">Classes of Street-Sweeping Employers.</span></i></h3>

<p>(1.) <i>Traders</i>, who undertake contracts for
scavengery as a speculation. Under this denomination
may be classed the contractors with
parishes, districts, boards, liberties, divisions and
subdivisions of parishes, markets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Parishes</i>, who employ the men as a matter
of parochial policy, with a view to the reduction
of the rates, and with little regard to the men.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>Philanthropists</i>, who seek, more particularly,
to benefit the men whom they employ,
while they strive to promote the public good by
increasing public cleanliness and order.</p>

<p>Under the head of “Traders” are the contractors
with the parishes, &amp;c., and the proprietors
of the sweeping-machines, who are in the same
capacity as the “regular contractors” respecting
their dealings with labourers, but who substitute
mechanical for manual operations.</p>

<p>Of these several classes of masters engaged in
the scavengery of the metropolis I have much to
say, and, for the clearer saying of it, I shall treat
each of the several varieties of labour separately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Contractors for Scavengery.</span></h3>

<p>The scavenging of the streets of the metropolis is
performed <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i> by the authorities
of the several parishes “without the City,” who
have the power to levy rates for the cleansing of
the various districts; within the City, however,
the office is executed under the direction of the
Court of Sewers.</p>

<p>When the cleansing of the streets is performed
indirectly by either the parochial or civic authorities,
it is effected by contractors, that is to say, by
traders who undertake for a certain sum to remove
the street-refuse at stated intervals and
under express conditions, and who employ paid
servants to execute the work for them. When it
is performed <i>directly</i>, the authorities employ labourers,
generally from the workhouse, and usually
enter into an agreement with some contractor for
the use of his carts and appliances, together with
the right to deposit in his wharf or yard the refuse
removed from the streets.</p>

<p>I shall treat first of the <i>indirect</i> mode of
scavenging&mdash;that is to say, of cleansing the streets
by contract&mdash;beginning with the contractors,
setting forth, as near as possible, the receipts and
expenditure in connection with the trade, and
then proceeding in due order to treat of the
labourers employed by them in the performance
of the task.</p>

<p>Some of the contractors agree with the parochial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
or district authorities to remove the dust from the
house-bins as well as the dirt from the streets
under one and the same contract; some undertake
to execute these two offices under separate contracts;
and some to perform only one of them.
It is most customary, however, for the same contractor
to serve the parish, especially the larger
parishes, in both capacities.</p>

<p>There is no established or legally required
<i>form</i> of agreement between a contractor and his
principals; it is a bargain in which each side
strives to get the best of it, but in which the
parish representatives have often to contend
against something looking like a monopoly; a
very common occurrence in our day when capitalists
choose to combine, which <i>is</i> legal, or unnoticed,
but very heinous on the part of the
working men, whose capital is only in their
strength or skill. One contractor, on being questioned
by a gentleman officially connected with a
large district, as to the existence of combination,
laughed at such a notion, but said there might be
“a sort of understanding one among another,” as
among people who “must look to their own interests,
and see which way the cat jumped;”
concluding with the undeniable assertion that
“no man ought reasonably to be expected to ruin
himself for a parish.”</p>

<p>There does not appear, however, to have been
any countervailing qualities on the part of the
parishes to this understanding among the contractors;
for some of the authorities have found
themselves, when a new or a renewed contract
was in question, suddenly “on the other side of
the hedge.” Thus, in the south-west district of
St. Pancras, the contractor, five or six years ago,
paid 100<i>l.</i> per annum for the removal and possession
of the street-dirt, &amp;c.; but the following year the
district authorities had to pay him 500<i>l.</i> for the
same labour and with the same privileges! Other
changes took place, and in 1848-9 a contractor
again paid the district 95<i>l.</i> I have shown, too,
that in Shadwell the dust-contractor now <i>receives</i>
450<i>l.</i> per annum, whereas he formerly <i>paid</i> 240<i>l.</i>
To prove, however, that a spirit of combination
does <i>occasionally</i> exist among these contractors, I
may cite the following minute from one of the
parish books.</p>

<p>“Your Committee, anxious to prevent any increase
in the watering-rate from being levied, and
considering the amount required by the contractors
for this service as excessive and exorbitant,
and even evincing a spirit of combination, resolved
to make an inroad upon this system, and after
much trouble and attention adopted other measures
for watering the district, the results of
which they have great pleasure in presenting to
the Board, by which it will be seen that a saving
over the very lowest of the above tenders of
102<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> has been effected; the sum of 18<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i>
has been paid for pauper labour at the same time.
Your Committee regret that, notwithstanding the
efforts of themselves and their officers, the state of
insubordination and insult of most of the paupers
(in spite of all encouragement to industry) was
such, that the Committee, on the 12th of July
last, were reluctantly compelled to discontinue
their services. The Committee cannot but congratulate
the Board upon the result of their
experiment, which will have the effect of breaking
up a spirit of combination highly dangerous to the
community at large, at the same time that their
labours have caused a very considerable saving to
the ratepayers; and they trust the work, considering
all the numerous disadvantages under
which they have laboured, has been performed in
a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The other conditions relate to the removal of
the dust from the houses (a subject I have already
treated), and specify the fines, varying from 1<i>l.</i> to
5<i>l.</i>, to be paid by the contractors, for the violation
or neglect of any of the provisions of the contract.
It is further required that “Each Foreman,
Sweeper, and Dustman, in the employ of either of
the Contractors,” (of whom there are four, Messrs.
Sinnott, Rooke, Reddin, and Gould), “will be required
to wear a Badge on the arm with these
words thereon,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
“‘London Sewers,<br />
N<sup>o</sup>. &mdash;<br />
Guildhall,’
</p>

<p>by which means any one having cause of complaint
against any of the men in the performance of their
several duties, may, by taking down the number
of the man and applying at the Sewers’ Office,
Guildhall, have reference to his name and employer.</p>

<p>“Any man working without his Badge, for
each day he offends, the Contractor is liable to
the penalty of Five Shillings.</p>

<p>“All the sweepings of the Streets, and all the
dust and ashes from the Houses, are to be entirely
carted away from the City of London, on a
Penalty of <i>Ten Pounds</i> for each cart-load.”</p>

<p>These terms sufficiently show the general nature
of the contracts in question; the principal difference
being that in some parts, the contractor is not
required to sweep the streets more than once, twice,
or thrice a week in ordinary weather.</p>

<p>The number of individuals in London styling
themselves Master Scavengers is 34. Of these,
10 are at present without a contract either for
dust or scavenging, and 5 have a contract for
removing the dust only; so that, deducting these
two numbers, the gross number 34 is reduced
to 19 scavenging contractors. Of the
latter number 16 are in a large way of business,
having large yards, possessing several carts
and some waggons, and employing a vast number
of men daily in sweeping the streets, carting
rubbish, &amp;c. The other 3 masters, however,
are only in a small way of business, being persons
of more limited means. A <i>large</i> master scavenger
employs from 3 to 18 carts, and from 18 to
upwards of 40 men at scavengery alone, while
a small master employs only from 1 to 3 carts
and from 3 to 6 men. By the table I have
given, p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, vol. ii., it is shown that there are
52 <i>contracts</i> between the several district authorities
and master scavengers, and nineteen <i>contractors</i>,
without counting members of the same family,
as distinct individuals; this gives an average of
nearly three distinct contracts per individual.
The contracts are usually for a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>Although the table above referred to shows
but 19 contractors for public scavenging, there
are, as I have said, more, or about 24, in London,
most of them in a “large way,” and next year
some of those who have no contracts at present
may enter into agreements with the parishes. The
smallness of this number, when we consider the
vast extent of the metropolis, confirms the notion
of the sort of monopoly and combination to which
I have alluded. In the Post-Office Directory for
1851 there are no names under the heads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Scavengers or Dustmen, but under the head of
“Rubbish Carters,” 28 are given, 9 names being
marked as “Dust Contractors” and 10 as “Nightmen.”</p>

<p>Of large contractors, however, there are, as I
have said, about 24, but they may not all obtain
contracts every year, and in this number are included
different members of the same family or
firm, who may undertake specific contracts, although
in the trade it is looked upon as “one
concern.” The smaller contractors were represented
to me as rather more numerous than the
others, and perhaps numbered 40, but it is not
easy to define what is to be accounted a contractor.
In the table given in pp. <a href="#Page_212">213, 214</a>, I cite only 7 as
being the better known. The others may be considered
as small rubbish-carters and flying-dustmen.</p>

<p>There are yet other transactions in which the
contractors are engaged with the parishes, independently
of their undertaking the whole labour
of street and house cleansing. In the parishes
where pauper, or “poor” labour is resorted to&mdash;for
it is not always that the men employed by
the parishes are positive “paupers,” but rather
the unemployed poor of the parish&mdash;in such
parishes, I say, an agreement is entered into with
a contractor for the deposit of the collected street
dirt at his yard or wharf. For such deposit the
contractor must of course be paid, as it is really
an occupation and renting of a portion of his
premises for a specific purpose. The street dirt,
however, is usually left to the disposal of the contractor,
for his own profit, and where he once
paid 50<i>l.</i> for the possession of the street-collected
dirt of a parish, collected by labour which was no
cost to him, he may now <i>receive</i> half of such 50<i>l.</i>,
or whatever the terms of the agreement may be.
I heard of one contractor who lately received 25<i>l.</i>
where he once paid 50<i>l.</i></p>

<p>In another way, too, contractors are employed
by parishes. Where pauper or poor labour in
street cleansing is the practice, a contractor’s horses,
carts, and cart-drivers are hired for the conveyance
of the dirt from the streets. This of course
is for a specific payment, and is in reality the work
of the tradesmen who in the Post Office Directory
are described as “Rubbish Carters,” and of whom
I shall have to speak afterwards. Some parishes
or paving boards have, however, their own horses
and vehicles, but in the other respects they have
dealings with the contractors.</p>

<p>To come to as correct a conclusion as possible
in this complicated and involved matter, I have
obtained the aid of some gentlemen long familiar
with such procedures. One of them said that to
procure the accounts of such transactions for a
series of years, with all their chops and changes,
or to obtain a perfectly precise return, for any
three years, affecting the whole metropolis, would
be the work of a parliamentary commission with
full powers “to send for papers,” &amp;c., &amp;c., and
that even <i>then</i> the result might not be satisfactory
as a clear exposition. However, with the aid of
the gentlemen alluded to, I venture upon the
following approximation.</p>

<p>As my present inquiry relates only to the
Scavenging Contractors in the metropolis, I will
take the number of districts, markets, &amp;c., which
are specified in the table, p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, vol. ii. These
are 83 in number, of which 29 are shown to be
scavenged by the “parish.” I will not involve in
this computation any of the more rural places
which may happen to be in the outskirts of the
metropolitan area, but I will take the contracts as
54, where the contractors do the entire work, and
as 29 where they are but the rubbish-carters and
dirt receivers of the parishes.</p>

<p>I am assured that it is a fair calculation that
the scavengery of the streets, apart from the removal
of the dust from the houses, costs in payments
to the contractors, 150<i>l.</i> as an average, to
each of the several 54 districts; and that in the
29 localities in which the streets are cleansed by
parish labour, the sum paid is at the rate of 50<i>l.</i>
per locality, some of them, as the five districts of
Marylebone for instance, being very large. This
is calculated regardless of the cases where parishes
may have their own horses and vehicles, for the
cost to the rate-payers may not be very materially
different, between paying for the hire of carts and
horses, and investing capital in their purchase and
incurring the expense of wear and tear. The account
then stands <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Parish payment on 54 contracts, 150<i>l.</i> each</td><td>£8100</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Parish payment on 29 contracts, 50<i>l.</i> each</td><td>1450</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Yearly total sum paid for Scavenging of the Metropolis</td><td class="total">£9550</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>or, apportioned among 19 <i>contractors</i>, upwards of
500<i>l.</i> each; and among 83 <i>contracts</i>, about 115<i>l.</i>
per <i>contract</i>. Even if other contractors are employed
where parish labour is pursued, the cost
to the rate-payers is the same. This calculation
is made, as far as possible, as regards scavengery
alone; and is independent of the value of the
refuse collected. It is about the scavengery that
the grand fight takes place between the parishes
and contractors; the house dust, being uninjured
by rain or street surface-water, is more available
for trade purposes.</p>

<p>From this it would appear that the cost of
cleansing the streets of London may be estimated
in round numbers at 10,000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>The next point in the inquiry is, What is the
value of the street dirt annually collected?</p>

<p>The price I have adduced for the dirt gained
from the streets is 3<i>s.</i> per load, which is a very
reasonable average. If the load be dung, or even
chiefly dung, it is worth 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> With the
proportion of dung and street refuse to be found
in such a thoroughfare as the Haymarket, in dry,
or comparatively dry weather, a load, weighing
about a ton, is worth about 3<i>s.</i> in the purchaser’s
own cart. On the other hand, as I have shown
that quantities of mixed or slop “mac” have to be
wasted, that some is sold at a nominal price, and
a good deal at 1<i>s.</i> the load, 3<i>s.</i> is certainly a fair
average.</p>

<p>Thus the annual sum of the street-dirt, as
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>regards
the quantity collected by the contracting
scavengers (as shown in the table given at page
<a href="#Page_186">186</a>), is, in round numbers, 89,000 cart-loads;
that collected by parish labour, with or without
the aid of the street-sweeping machines, at 52,000
cart-loads, or a total (I do not include what is
collected by the orderlies) of 141,000 loads.</p>

<p>This result shows, then, that the contractors
yearly collect by scavenging the streets with their
own paid labourers, and receive as the produce of
pauper labour, as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>or a value of rather more than 1113<i>l.</i> as the return
to each individual contractor in the table, or
about 255<i>l.</i> as the average on each contract.
As, however, the whole of the parish-collected
manure does not come into the hands of the
contractors, it will be fair, I am assured, to
compute the total at 19,000<i>l.</i>, a sum of 1000<i>l.</i> to
each contractor, or nearly 229<i>l.</i> on each contract.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that the total receipts of
the contractors for the scavenging of London
amount to very nearly 30,000<i>l.</i>; that is to say,
10,000<i>l.</i> as remuneration for the office, and
20,000<i>l.</i> as the value of the dirt collected. But
against this sum as received, we have to set the
gross expense of wages paid to men, wear and
tear of carts and appliances, rent of wharfs,
interest for money, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Concerning the amount paid in wages, it appears
by the table at pp. <a href="#Page_186">186, 187</a>, that the men
employed by the scavenging contractors in wet
weather, are 260 daily (being nearly half of
the whole force of 531 men, the orderlies
excepted). In dry weather, however, there are
only 194 men employed. I will therefore calculate
upon 194 men employed daily, and 66 employed
half the year, making the total of 260. By
the table here given, it will be seen that the total
number of scavengers employed by the large and
small contractors, is 275.</p>

<p>There remains now to show the amount of
capital which a large contractor must embark in
his business: I include the amount of rent, and the
expenditure on what must be provided for business
purposes, and which is subject to wear and
tear, to decay, and loss.</p>

<p>There are not now, I am told, more than twelve
scavengers’ wharfs and 20 yards (the wharf being
also a yard) in the possession of the contractors in
regular work. These are the larger contractors,
and their capital, I am assured, may be thus <span class="lock">estimated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I have endeavoured in this estimate to confine
myself, as much as possible, to the separate subject
of scavengery, but it must be borne in mind that
as the large contractors are dustmen as well as
scavengers, the great charges for rent and barges
cannot be considered as incurred solely on account
of the street-dirt trade. Including, then, the payments
from parishes, the account will stand
<span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Contractors’ (or Employers’)
Premises, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>At page <a href="#Page_171">171</a> of the present volume I have described
one of the yards devoted to the trade in
house-dust, and I have little to say in addition
regarding the premises of the contracting or employing
scavengers. They are the same places,
and the industrious pursuits carried on there, and
the division and subdivision of labour, relate far
more to the dustmen’s department than to the
scavengers’. When the produce of the sweeping
of the streets has been thrown into the cart, it is
so far ready for use that it has not to be sifted or
prepared, as has the house-dust, for the formation
of brieze, &amp;c., the “mac” being sifted by the
purchaser.</p>

<p>These yards or wharfs are far less numerous
and better conducted now than they were ten
years ago. They are at present fast disappearing
from the banks of the Thames (there is, however,
one still at Whitefriars and one at Milbank).
They are chiefly to be found on the banks of the
canals. Some of the principal wharfs near
Maiden-lane, St. Pancras, are to be found among
unpaven, or ill-paved, or imperfectly macadamized
roads, along which run rows of what were once
evidently pleasant suburban cottages, with their
green porches and their trained woodbine, clematis,
jasmine, or monthly roses; these tenements, however,
are now occupied chiefly by the labourers at
the adjacent stone, coal, lime, timber, dust, and
general wharfs. Some of the cottages still presented,
on my visits, a blooming display of dahlias
and other autumnal flowers; and in one corner of
a very large and very black-looking dust-yard, in
which rose a huge mound of dirt, was the cottage
residence of the man who remained in charge of
the wharf all night, and whose comfortable-looking
abode was embedded in flowers, blooming
luxuriantly. The gay-tinted holly-hocks and
dahlias are in striking contrast with the dinginess
of the dust-yards, while the canal flows along,
dark, sluggish, and muddy, as if to be in keeping
with the wharf it washes.</p>

<p>The dust-yards must not be confounded with
the “night-yards,” or the places where the contents
of the cess-pools are deposited, places which,
since the passing of the Sanatory Act, are rapidly
disappearing.</p>

<p>Upon entering a dust-yard there is generally
found a heavy oppressive sort of atmosphere,
more especially in wet or damp weather. This is
owing to the tendency of charcoal to absorb gases,
and to part with them on being saturated with
moisture. The cinder-heaps of the several dust-yards,
with their million pores, are so many huge
gasometers retaining all the offensive gases arising
from the putrefying organic matters which usually
accompany them, and parting with such gases immediately
on a fall of rain. It would be a curious
calculation to estimate the quantity of deleterious
gas thus poured into the atmosphere after a
slight shower.</p>

<p>The question has been raised as to the propriety
of devoting some special locality to the purposes
of dust-yards, and it is certainly a question deserving
public attention.</p>

<p>The chief disposal of the street manure is from
barges, sent by the Thames or along the canals,
and sold to farmers and gardeners. In the larger
wharfs, and in those considered removed from
the imputation of “scurfdom,” six men, and often
but four, are employed to load a barge which
contains from 30 to 40 tons. In such cases the
dust-yard and the wharf are one and the same
place. The contents of these barges are mixed,
about one-fourth being “mac,” the rest street-mud
and dung. This admixture, on board the vessel,
is called by the bargemen and the contractors’
servants at the wharfs Leicester (properly Læsta,
a load). We have the same term at the end of
our word bal-<i>last</i>.</p>

<p>I am assured by a wharfinger, who has every
means of forming a correct judgment, it may
be estimated that there are dispatched from the
contractors’ wharfs twelve barges daily, freighted
with street-manure. This is independent of the
house-dust barged to the country brick-fields.
The weight of the cargo of a barge of manure
is about 40 tons; 36 tons being a low average.
This gives 3744 barge-loads, or 132,784 tons,
or loads, yearly; for it must be recollected
that the dirt gathered by pauper labour is dispatched
from the contractors’ yards or wharfs,
as well as that collected by the immediate servants
of the contractors. The price per barge-load at
the canal, basin, or wharf, in the country parts
where agriculture flourishes, is from 5<i>l.</i> to 6<i>l.</i>,
making a total of 20,594<i>l.</i> The difference of that
sum, and the total given in the table (21,147<i>l.</i>)
may be accounted for on the supposition that the
remainder is sold in the yards and carted away
thence. The slop and valueless dirt is not included
in this calculation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Working Scavengers under the
Contractors.</span></h3>

<p>I have now to deal with what throughout the
whole course of my inquiry into the state of
London Labour and the London Poor I have considered
the great object of investigation&mdash;the
condition and characteristics of the working men;
and what is more immediately the “labour question,”
the relation of the labourer to his employer,
as to rates of payment, modes of payment, hiring
of labourers, constancy or inconstancy of work,
supply of hands, the many points concerning
wages, perquisites, family work, and parochial or
club relief.</p>

<p>First, I shall give an account of the class employment,
together with the labour season and
earnings of the labourers, or “economical” part of
the subject. I shall then pass to the social points,
concerning their homes, general expenditure,
&amp;c., and then to the more moral and intellectual
questions of education, literature, politics, religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
marriage, and concubinage of the men and of their
families. All this will refer, it should be remembered,
only to the working scavagers in the
honourable or better-paid trade; the cheaper
labourers I shall treat separately as a distinct
class; the details in both cases I shall illustrate
with the statement of men of the class described.</p>

<p>The first part of this multifarious subject appertains
to the division of labour. This in the
scavaging trade consists rather of that kind of
“gang-work” which Mr. Wakefield styles “simple
co-operation,” or the working together of a number
of people at the same thing, as opposed to “complex
co-operation,” or the working together of a number
at <i>different branches</i> of the same thing. Simple
co-operation is of course the ruder kind; but even
this, rude as it appears, is far from being barbaric.
“The savages of New Holland,” we are
told, “never help each other even in the most
simple operations; and their condition is hardly
superior&mdash;in some respects it is inferior&mdash;to that
of the wild animals which they now and then
catch.”</p>

<p>As an instance of the advantages of “simple
co-operation,” Mr. Wakefield tells us that “in a
vast number of simple operations performed by
human exertion, it is quite obvious that two men
working together will do more than four, or four
times four men, each of whom should work alone.
In the lifting of heavy weights, for example, in
the felling of trees, in the gathering of much hay
and corn during a short period of fine weather,
in draining a large extent of land during the
short season when such a work may be properly
conducted, in the pulling of ropes on board ship,
in the rowing of large boats, in some mining
operations, in the erection of a scaffolding for a
building, and in the breaking of stones for the
repair of a road, so that the whole road shall
always be kept in good repair&mdash;in all these
simple operations, and thousands more, it is
absolutely necessary that many persons should
work together at the same time, in the same place,
and in the same way.”</p>

<p>To the above instances of simple co-operation,
or gang-working, as it may be briefly styled in
Saxon English, Mr. Wakefield might have added
dock labour and scavaging.</p>

<p>The principle of complex co-operation, however,
is not entirely unknown in the public cleansing
trade. This business consists of as many branches
as there are distinct kinds of refuse, and these
appear to be four. There are (1) the wet and (2)
the dry <i>house</i>-refuse (or dust and night-soil),
and (3) the wet and (4) the dry <i>street</i>-refuse (or
mud and rubbish); and in these four different
branches of the one general trade the principle
of complex co-operation is found commonly,
though not invariably, to prevail.</p>

<p>The difference as to the class employments of
the general body of public cleansers&mdash;the dustmen,
street-sweepers, nightmen, and rubbish-carters&mdash;seems
to be this:&mdash;any nightman will
work as a dustman or scavager; but it is not all
the dustmen and scavagers who will work as
nightmen. The reason is almost obvious. The
avocations of the dustman and the nightman are
in some degree hereditary. A rude man provides
for the future maintenance of his sons in the way
which is most patent to his notice; he makes the
boy share in his own labour, and grow up unfit
for anything else.</p>

<p>The regular working scavagers are then generally
a distinct class from the working dustmen,
and are all paid by the week, while the dustmen
are paid by the load. In very wet weather, when
there is a great quantity of “slop” in the streets,
a dustman is often called upon to lend a helping
hand, and sometimes when a working scavager
is out of employ, in order to keep himself from
want, he goes to a “job of dust work,” but seldom
from any other cause.</p>

<p>In a parish where there is a crowded population,
the dustman’s labours consume, on an
average, from six to eight hours a day. In
scavagery, the average hours of daily work are
twelve (Sundays of course excepted), but they sometimes
extended to fifteen, and even sixteen hours,
in places of great business traffic; while in very
fine dry weather, the twelve hours may be
abridged by two, three, four, or even more. Thus
it is manifest that the consumption of time alone
prevents the same working men being simultaneously
dustmen and scavagers. In the more
remote and quiet parishes, however, and under the
management of the smaller contractors, the opposite
arrangement frequently exists; the operative is
a scavager one day, and a dustman the next. This
is not the case in the busier districts, and with the
large contractors, unless exceptionally, or on an
emergency.</p>

<p>If the scavagers or dustmen have completed
their street and house labours in a shorter time
than usual, there is generally some sort of employment
for them in the yards or wharfs of the
contractors, or they may sometimes avail themselves
of their leisure to enjoy themselves in their
own way. In many parts, indeed, as I have
shown, the street-sweeping must be finished by
noon, or earlier.</p>

<p>Concerning the <i>division of labour</i>, it may be
said, that the principle of complex co-operation in
the scavaging trade exists only in its rudest form,
for the characteristics distinguishing the labour of
the working scavagers are far from being of that
complicated nature common to many other callings.</p>

<p>As regards the act of sweeping or scraping the
streets, the labour is performed by the <i>gangsman</i>
and his <i>gang</i>. The gangsman usually loads the
cart, and occasionally, when a number are employed
in a district, acts as a foreman by superintending
them, and giving directions; he is a
working scavager, but has the office of overlooker
confided to him, and receives a higher
amount of wage than the others.</p>

<p>For the completion of the street-work there are
the <i>one-horse carmen</i> and the <i>two-horse carmen</i>,
who are also working scavagers, and so called
from their having to load the carts drawn by one
or two horses. These are the men who shovel
into the cart the dirt swept or scraped to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
side of the public way by the gang (some of it
mere slop), and then drive the cart to its destination,
which is generally their master’s yard.
Thus far only does the street-labour extend. The
carmen have the care of the vehicles in cleaning
them, greasing the wheels, and such like, but the
horses are usually groomed by stablemen, who are
not employed in the streets.</p>

<p>The division of labour, then, among the working
scavagers, may be said to be as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1st. The <i>ganger</i>, whose office it is to superintend
the gang, and shovel the dirt into the cart.</p>

<p>2nd. The gang, which consists of from three to
ten or twelve men, who sweep in a row and collect
the dirt in heaps ready for the ganger to shovel
into the cart.</p>

<p>3rd. The carman (one-horse or two-horse, as
the case may be), who attends to the horse and
cart, brushes the dirt into the ganger’s shovel, and
assists the ganger in wet sloppy weather in carting
the dirt, and then takes the mud to the place
where it is deposited.</p>

<p>There is only one <i>mode of payment</i> for the above
labours pursued among the master scavagers, and
that is by the week.</p>

<p>1st. The ganger receives a weekly salary of
18<i>s.</i> when working for an “honourable” master;
with a “scurf,” however, the ganger’s pay is but
16<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>2nd. The gang receive in a large establishment
each 16<i>s.</i> per week, but in a small one they usually
get from 14<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a week. When working
for a small master they have often, by working
over hours, to “make eight days to the week
instead of six.”</p>

<p>3rd. The one-horse carman receives 16<i>s.</i> a week
in a large, and 15<i>s.</i> in a small establishment.</p>

<p>4th. The two-horse carman receives 18<i>s.</i> weekly,
but is employed only by the larger masters.</p>

<p>On the <a href="#Page_220">opposite page</a> I give a table on this
point.</p>

<p>Some of these men are paid by the day, some
by the week, and some on Wednesdays and
Saturdays, perhaps in about equal proportions,
the “casuals” being mostly paid by the day, and
the regular hands (with some exceptions among
the scurfs) once or twice a week. The chance
hands are sometimes engaged for a half day,
and, as I was told, “jump at a bob and a joey
(1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>), or at a bob.” I heard of one contractor
who not unfrequently said to any foreman or
gangsman who mentioned to him the applications
for work, “O, give the poor devils a turn, if it’s
only for a day now and then.”</p>

<p><i>Piece-work</i>, or, as the scavagers call it, “by the
load,” <i>did</i> at one time prevail, but not to any great
extent. The prices varied, according to the nature
and the state of the road, from 2<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
load. The system of piece-work was never liked
by the men; it seems to have been resorted to
less as a system, or mode of labour, than to insure
assiduity on the part of the working scavagers,
when a rapid street-cleansing was desirable. It
was rather in the favour of the working man’s
<i>individual</i> emoluments than otherwise, as may be
shown in the following way. In Battle-bridge,
four men collect five loads in dry, and six men
seven loads in wet weather. If the average
piece hire be 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a load, it is 2<i>s.</i> 9&frac34;<i>d.</i> for each
of the five men’s day’s work; if 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a load, it
is 2<i>s.</i> 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> (the regular wage, and an extra halfpenny);
if 2<i>s.</i>, it is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and if less (which
has been paid), the day’s wage is not lower than
2<i>s.</i> At the lowest rates, however, the men, I
was informed, could not be induced to take the
necessary pains, as they <i>would</i> struggle to “make
up half-a-crown;” while, if the streets were
scavaged in a slovenly manner, the contractor
was sure to hear from his friends of the parish
that he was not acting up to his contract. I
could not hear of any men now set to piece-work
within the precincts of the places specified in the
table. This extra work and scamping work are
the two great evils of the piece system.</p>

<p>In their payments to their men the contractors
show a superiority to the practices of some traders,
and even of some dock-companies&mdash;the men are
never paid at public-houses; the payment, moreover,
is always in money. One contractor told
me that he would like all his men to be teetotallers,
if he could get them, though he was not
one himself.</p>

<p>But these remarks refer only to the <i>nominal</i>
wages of the scavagers; and I find the nominal
wages of operatives in many cases are widely different
(either from some additions by way of
perquisites, &amp;c., or deductions by way of fines,
&amp;c., but oftener the latter) from the <i>actual</i>
wages received by them. Again, the average
wages, or gross yearly income of the casually-employed
men, are very different from those of
the constant hands; so are the gains of a particular
individual often no criterion of the general
or average earnings of the trade. Indeed I find
that the several varieties of wages may be classified
as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Nominal Wages.</i>&mdash;Those said to be paid in
a trade.</p>

<p>2. <i>Actual Wages.</i>&mdash;Those <i>really</i> received, and
which are equal to the nominal wages, <i>plus</i>
the additions to, or <i>minus</i> the deductions from,
them.</p>

<p>3. <i>Casual Wages.</i>&mdash;The earnings of the men
who are only occasionally employed.</p>

<p>4. <i>Average Casual or Constant Wages.</i>&mdash;Those
obtained throughout the year by such as are
either occasionally or regularly employed.</p>

<p>5. <i>Individual Wages.</i>&mdash;Those of particular
hands, whether belonging to the scurf or honourable
trade, whether working long or short hours,
whether partially or fully employed, and the like.</p>

<p>6. <i>General Wages.</i>&mdash;Or the <i>average</i> wages of
the whole trade, constant or casual, fully or partially
employed, honourable or scurf, long and
short hour men, &amp;c., &amp;c., all lumped together and
the mean taken of the whole.</p>

<p>Now in the preceding account of the working
scavagers’ mode and rate of payment I have
spoken only of the nominal wages; and in order
to arrive at their actual wages we must, as we
have seen, ascertain what additions and what
deductions are generally made to and from this
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
amount. The deductions in the honourable trade
are, as usual, inconsiderable.</p>

<p>All the <i>tools</i> used by operative scavagers are
supplied to them by their employers&mdash;the tools
being only brooms and shovels; and for this
supply there are <i>no stoppages</i> to cover the expense.</p>

<p>Neither by <i>fines</i> nor by way of <i>security</i> are
the men’s wages reduced.</p>

<p>The <i>truck system</i>, moreover, is unknown, and
has never prevailed in the trade. I heard of only
one instance of an approach to it. A yard foreman,
some years ago, who had a great deal of
influence with his employer, had a chandler’s-shop,
managed by his wife, and it was broadly
intimated to the men that they must make their
purchases there. Complaints, however, were
made to the contractor, and the foreman dismissed.
One man of whom I inquired did not
even know what the “truck system” meant; and
when informed, thought they were “pretty safe”
from it, as the contractor had nothing which he
<i>could</i> truck with the men, and if “he polls us
hisself,” the man said, “he’s not likely to let
anybody else do it.”</p>

<p>There are, moreover, no trade-payments to which
the men are subjected; there are no trade-societies
among the working men, no benefit nor sick clubs;
neither do parochial relief and family labour
characterize the regular hands in the honourable
trade, although in sickness they may have no other
resource.</p>

<p>Indeed, the working scavagers employed by
the more honourable portion of the trade, instead
of having any deductions made from their nominal
wages, have rather additions to them in the form of
perquisites coming from the public. These perquisites
consist of allowances of beer-money, obtained
in the same manner as the dustmen&mdash;not through
the medium of their employers (though, to say
the least, through their sufferance), but from the
householders of the parish in which their labours
are prosecuted.</p>

<p>The scavagers, it seems, are not required to
sweep any places considered “private,” nor even
to sweep the public foot-paths; and when they <i>do</i>
sweep or carry away the refuse of a butcher’s
premises, for instance&mdash;for, by law, the butcher is
required to do so himself&mdash;they receive a gratuity.
In the contract entered into by the city scavagers,
it is expressly covenanted that no men
employed shall accept gratuities from the householders;
a condition little or not at all regarded,
though I am told that these gratuities become less
every year. I am informed also by an experienced
butcher, who had at one time a private
slaughter-house in the Borough, that, until within
these six or seven years, he thought the scavagers,
and even the dustmen, would carry away
entrails, &amp;c., in the carts, from the butcher’s and
the knacker’s premises, for an allowance.</p>

<p>I cannot learn that the contractors, whether of
the honourable or scurf trade, take any advantage
of these “allowances.” A working scavager receives
the same wage, when he enjoys what I
heard called in another trade “the height of
perquisites,” or is employed in a locality where
there are no such additions to his wages. I
believe, however, that the contracting scavagers
let their best and steadiest hands have the best
perquisited work.</p>

<p>These perquisites, I am assured, average from 1<i>s.</i>
to 2<i>s.</i> a week, but one butcher told me he thought
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> might be rather too high an average, for a
pint of beer (2<i>d.</i>) was the customary sum given,
and that was, or ought to be, divided among the
gang. “In my opinion,” he said, “there’ll be
no allowances in a year or two.” By the amount
of these perquisites, then, the scavagers’ gains are
so far enhanced.</p>

<p>The wages, therefore, of an operative scavager
in full employ, and working for the “honourable”
portion of the trade, may be thus <span class="lock">expressed:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Casual Hands” among the
Scavagers.</span></h3>

<p>Of the scavagers proper there are, as in all
classes of unskilled labour, that is to say, of
labour which requires no previous apprenticeship,
and to which any one can “turn his hand” on an
emergency, two distinct orders of workmen, “the
<i>regulars</i> and <i>casuals</i>” to adopt the trade terms;
that is to say, the labourers consist of those
who have been many years at the trade, constantly
employed at it, and those who have but
recently taken to it as a means of obtaining a
subsistence after their ordinary resources have
failed. This mixture of <i>constant</i> and <i>casual</i> hands
is, moreover, a necessary consequence of all trades
which depend upon the seasons, and in which an
additional number of labourers are required at
different periods. Such is necessarily the case
with dock labour, where an easterly wind prevailing
for several days deprives <i>thousands of
work</i>, and where the change from a foul to a fair
wind causes an equally inordinate demand for
workmen. The same temporary increase of employment
takes place in the agricultural districts at
harvesting time, and the same among the hop
growers in the picking season; and it will be
hereafter seen that there are the same labour
fluctuations in the scavaging trade, a greater or
lesser number of hands being required, of course,
according as the season is wet or dry.</p>

<p>This occasional increase of employment, though
a benefit in some few cases (as enabling a man
suddenly deprived of his ordinary means of living
to obtain “a job of work” until he can “turn
himself round”), is generally a most alarming
evil in a State. What are the casual hands to do
when the extra employment ceases? Those who
have paid attention to the subject of dock labour
and the subject of casual labour in general, may
form some notion of the vast mass of misery
that must be generally existing in London. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
subject of hop-picking again belongs to the same
question. Here are thousands of the very poorest
employed only for a few days in the year. What,
the mind naturally asks, do they after their
short term of honest independence has ceased?
With dock labour the poor man’s bread depends
upon the very winds; in scavaging and in
street life generally it depends upon the rain; and
in market-gardening, harvesting, hop-picking, and
the like, it depends upon the sunshine. How
many thousands in this huge metropolis have to
look immediately to the very elements for their
bread, it is overwhelming to contemplate; and
yet, with all this fitfulness of employment we
wonder that an extended knowledge of reading
and writing does not produce a decrease of crime!
We should, however, ask ourselves whether men
can stay their hunger with alphabets or grow fat
on spelling books; and wanting employment, and
consequently food, and objecting to the <i>incarceration</i>
of the workhouse, can we be astonished&mdash;indeed
is it not a natural law&mdash;that they should
help themselves to the property of others?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Concerning the “regular hands” of the contracting
scavagers, it may, perhaps, be reasonable
to compute that little short of one-half of them
have been “to the manner born.” The others
are, as I have said, what these regular hands
call “casuals,” or “casualties.” As an instance
of the peculiar mixture of the regular and casual
hands in the scavaging trade, I may state that
one of my informants told me he had, at one
period, under his immediate direction, fourteen
men, of whom the former occupations had been
as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>
<p>In my account of the street orderlies will be
given an interesting and elaborate statement of
the former avocations, the habits, expenditure,
&amp;c., of a body of street-sweepers, 67 in number.
This table will be found very curious, as showing
what classes of men have been <i>driven</i> to street-sweeping,
but it will not furnish a criterion of
the character of the “regular hands” employed
by the contractors.</p>

<p>The “casuals” or the “casualties” (always called
among the men “cazzelties”), may be more properly
described as men whose employment is accidental,
chanceful, or uncertain. The regular
hands of the scavagers are apt to designate any
new comer, even for a permanence, any sweeper
not reared to or versed in the business, a casual
(“cazzel”). I shall, however, here deal with the
“casual hands,” not only as hands newly introduced
into the trade, but as men of chanceful
and irregular employment.</p>

<p>These persons are now, I understand, numerous
in all branches of unskilled labour, willing to undertake
or attempt any kind of work, but perhaps
there is a greater tendency on the part of the
surplus unskilled to turn to scavaging, from the
fact that any broken-down man seems to account
himself competent to sweep the streets.</p>

<p>To ascertain the number of these casual or outside
labourers in the scavaging trade is difficult,
for, as I have said, they are willing in their need
to attempt any kind of work, and so may be
“casuals” in divers departments of unskilled
labour.</p>

<p>I do not think that I can better approximate
the number of casuals than by quoting the opinion
of a contracting scavager familiar with his workmen
and their ways. He considered that there
were always nearly as many hands on the look-out
for a job in the streets, as there were regularly
employed at the business by the large contractors;
this I have shown to be 262, let us estimate therefore
the number of casuals at 200.</p>

<p>According to the table I have given at pp. <a href="#Page_212">213,
214</a>, the number of men regularly or constantly
employed at the metropolitan trade is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Scavagers employed by large contractors</td><td>262</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Ditto small contractors</td><td>13</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Ditto machines</td><td>25</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Ditto parishes</td><td>218</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Ditto street-orderlies</td><td>60</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total working scavagers in London</td><td class="total">578</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>But the prior table given at pp. <a href="#Page_186">186, 187</a>,
shows the number of scavagers employed throughout
the metropolis in wet and dry weather (<i>exclusive
of the street-orderlies</i>) to be as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Scavagers employed in wet weather</td><td>531</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Ditto in dry weather</td><td>358</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Difference</td><td class="total">173</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence it would appear that about one-third less
hands are required in the dry than in the wet
season of the year. The 170 hands, then, discharged
in the dry season are the casually employed
men, but the whole of these 170 are not
turned adrift immediately they are no longer
wanted, some being kept on “odd jobs” in the
yard, &amp;c.; nor can that number be said to represent
the entire amount of the surplus labour in
the trade; but only that portion of it which <i>does</i>
obtain even casual employment. After much
trouble, and taking the average of various statements,
it would appear that the number of
casualty or quantity of occasional surplus labour
in the scavaging trade may be represented at
between 200 and 250 hands.</p>

<p>The scavaging trade, however, is not, I am informed,
so overstocked with labourers now as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
was formerly. Seven years ago, and from that to
ten, there were usually between 200 and 300
hands out of work; this was owing to there being
a less extent of paved streets, and comparatively
few contractors; the scavaging work, moreover,
was “scamped,” the men, to use their own
phrase, “licking the work over any how,” so that
fewer hands were required. Now, however,
the inhabitants are more particular, I am told,
“about the crooks and corners,” and require the
streets to be swept oftener. Formerly a gang of
operative scavagers would only collect six loads
of dirt a day, but now a gang will collect nine
loads daily. The causes to which the surplus of
labourers at present may be attributed are, I
find, as follows:&mdash;Each operative has to do nearly
double the work to what he formerly did, the extra
cleansing of the streets having tended not only to
employ more hands, but to make each of those
employed do more work. The result has, however
been followed by an increase in the wages of
the operatives; seven years ago the labourers received
but 2<i>s.</i> a day, and the ganger 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but
now the labourers receive 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a day, and the
ganger 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>In the city the men have to work very long
hours, sometimes as many as 18 hours a day without
any extra pay. This practice of overworking
is, I find, carried on to a great extent, even with
those master scavagers who pay the regular
wages. One man told me that when he worked
for a certain large master, whom he named, he has
many times been out at work 28 hours in the wet
(saturated to the skin) without having any rest.
This plan of overworking, again, is generally
adopted by the small masters, whose men, after
they have done a regular day’s labour, are set to
work in the yard, sometimes toiling 18 hours a
day, and usually not less than 16 hours daily.
Often so tired and weary are the men, that when
they rise in the morning to pursue their daily
labour, they feel as fatigued as when they went to
bed. “Frequently,” said one of my informants,
“have I gone to bed so worn out, that I haven’t been
able to sleep. However” (he added), “there is the
work to be done, and we must do it or be off.”</p>

<p>This system of overwork, especially in those
trades where the quantity of work to be done is
in a measure fixed, I find to be a far more influential
cause of surplus labour than “over
population.” The mere number of labourers in a
trade is, <i>per se</i>, no criterion as to the quantity of
labour employed in it; to arrive at this three
things are <span class="lock">required:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>(1) The number of hands;</li>
<li>(2) The hours of labour;</li>
<li>(3) The rate of labouring;</li>
</ul>


<p>for it is a mere point of arithmetic, that if the
hands in the scavaging trade work 18 hours a day,
there must be one-third less men employed than
there otherwise would, or in other words one-third
of the men who are in work must be thus
deprived of it. This is one of the crying evils of
the day, and which the economists, filled as they
are with their over-population theories, have entirely
overlooked.</p>

<p>There are 262 men employed in the Metropolitan
Scavaging Trade; one-half of these at the
least may be said to work 16 hours per diem instead
of 12, or one-third longer than they should;
so that if the hours of labour in this trade were
restricted to the usual day’s work, there would be
employment for one-sixth more hands, or nearly
50 individuals extra.</p>

<p>The other causes of the present amount of surplus
labour <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The many hands thrown out of employment by
the discontinuance of railway works.</p>

<p>A less demand for unskilled labour in agricultural
districts, or a smaller remuneration for it.</p>

<p>A less demand for some branches of labour (as
ostlers, &amp;c.), by the introduction of machinery
(applied to roads), or through the caprices of
fashion.</p>

<p>It should, however, be remembered, that men
often found their opinions of such causes on prejudices,
or express them according to their class
interests, and it is only a few employers of unskilled
labourers who care to inquire into the
antecedent circumstances of men who ask for
work.</p>

<p>As regards the population part of the question,
it cannot be said that the surplus labour of the
scavaging trade is referable to any inordinate increase
in the families of the men. Those who are
married appear to have, on the average, four children,
and about one-half of the men have no family
at all. Early marriages are by no means usual.
Of the casual hands, however, full three-fourths
are married, and one-half have families.</p>

<p>There are not more than ten or a dozen Irish
labourers who have taken to the scavaging, though
several have “tried it on;” the regular hands say
that the Irish are too lazy to continue at the trade;
but surely the labour of the hodman, in which
the Irish seem to delight, is sufficient to disprove
this assertion, be the cause what it may. About
one-fourth of the scavagers entering the scavaging
trade as casual hands have been agricultural
labourers, and have come up to London from
the several agricultural districts in quest of work;
about the same proportion appear to have been
connected with horses, such as ostlers, carmen,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>brisk and slack seasons</i> in the scavaging
trade depend upon the state of the weather. In
the depth of winter, owing to the shortness of
the days, more hands are usually required for
street cleansing; but a “clear frost” renders the
scavager’s labour in little demand. In the winter,
too, his work is generally the hardest, and
the hardest of all when there is snow, which soon
becomes mud in London streets; and though a
continued frost is a sort of lull to the scavagers’
labour, after “a great thaw” his strength is taxed
to the uttermost; and then, indeed, new hands
have had to be put on. At the West End, in the
height of the summer, which is usually the height
of the fashionable season, there is again a more
than usual requirement of scavaging industry in
wet weather; but perhaps the greatest exercise of
such industry is after a series of the fogs peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to the London atmosphere, when the men cannot
<i>see</i> to sweep. The table I have given shows the
influence of the weather, as on wet days 531 men
are employed, and on dry days only 358; this, however,
does not influence the Street-Orderly system,
as under it the men are employed every day, unless
the weather make it an actual impossibility.</p>

<p>According to the rain table given at p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>,
there would appear to be, on an average of 23
years, 178 wet days in London out of the 365,
that is to say, about 100 in every 205 days are
“rainy ones.” The months having the greatest
and least number of wet days are as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>No. of days in the month in which rain falls.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">December</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">July, August, October</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">February, May, November</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">January, April</td><td>14</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">March, September</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">June</td><td>11</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence it would appear that June is the least and
December the most showery month in the course
of the year; the greatest <i>quantity</i> of rain falling
in any month is, however, in October, and the
least quantity in March. The number of wet
days, and the quantity of rain falling in each half
of the year, may be expressed as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>Total in No. of wet days.</th><th>Total depth of rain falling in inches.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The first six months in the year ending June there are</td><td>84</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The second six months in the year ending December there are</td><td>93</td><td>14</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Hence we perceive that the quantity of work for
the scavagers would fluctuate in the first and
last half of the year in the proportion of 10 to 14,
which is very nearly in the ratio of 358 to 531, which
are the numbers of hands given in table pp. <a href="#Page_186">186,
187</a>, as those employed in wet and dry weather
throughout the metropolis.</p>

<p>If, then, the labour in the scavaging trade
varies in the proportion of 5 to 7, that is to say,
that 5 hands are required at one period and 7 at
another to execute the work, the question consequently
becomes, how do the 2 casuals who
are discharged out of every 7 obtain their living
when the wet season is over?</p>

<p>When a scavager is out of employ, he seldom
or never applies to the parish; this he does, I am
informed, only when he is fairly “beaten out”
through sickness or old age, for the men “hate
the thought of going to the big house” (the union
workhouse). An unemployed operative scavager
will go from yard to yard and offer his services
to do anything in the dust trade or any other
kind of employment in connection with dust or
scavaging.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an operative scavager who
is casually employed obtains work at that trade
for six or eight months during the year, and the remaining
portion of his time is occupied either at
rubbish-carting or brick-carting, or else he gets a
job for a month or two in a dust-yard.</p>

<p>Many of these men seem to form a body of
street-jobbers or operative labourers, ready to work
at the docks, to be navvies (when strong enough),
bricklayers’ labourers, street-sweepers, carriers of
trunks or parcels, window-cleaners, errand-goers,
porters, and (occasionally) nightmen. Few of
the class seem to apply themselves to trading, as
in the costermonger line. They are the loungers
about the boundaries of trading, but seldom take
any onward steps. The street-sweeper of this
week, a “casual” hand, may be a rubbish-carter
or a labourer about buildings the next, or he may
be a starving man for days together, and the more
he is starving with the less energy will he exert
himself to obtain work: “it’s not in” a starving
or ill-fed man to exert himself otherwise than
what may be called <i>passively</i>; this is well known
to all who have paid attention to the subject. The
want of energy and carelessness begotten by want
of food was well described by the tinman, at p.
355 in vol. i.</p>

<p>One casual hand told me that last year he was
out of work altogether three months, and the year
before not more than six weeks, and during the six
weeks he got a day’s work sometimes at rubbish
carting and sometimes at loading bricks. Their
wives are often employed in the yards as sifters,
and their boys, when big enough, work also at
the heap, either in carrying off, or else as fillers-in;
if there are any girls, one is generally left at
home to look after the rest and get the meals
ready for the other members of the family. If
any of the children go to school, they are usually
sent to a ragged school in the neighbourhood,
though they seldom attend the school more than
two or three times during the week.</p>

<p>The additional hands employed in wet weather
are either men who at other times work in the
yards, or such as have their “turns” in street-sweeping,
if not regularly employed. There appears,
however, to be little of system in the
arrangement. If more hands are wanted, the
gangsman, who receives his orders from the contractor
or the contractor’s managing man, is told
to put on so many new hands, and over-night he
has but to tell any of the men at work that Jack,
and Bob, and Bill will be wanted in the morning,
and they, if not employed in other work, appear
accordingly.</p>

<p>There is nothing, however, which can be designated
a <i>labour market</i> appertaining to the trade.
No “house of call,” no trade society. If men
seek such employment, they must apply at the
contractor’s premises, and I am assured that poor
men not unfrequently ask the scavagers whom
they see at work in the streets where to apply
“for a job,” and sometimes receive gruff or abusive
replies. But though there is nothing like a labour
market in the scavager’s trade, the employers have
not to “look out” for men, for I was told by one
of their foremen, that he would undertake, if
necessary, which it never was, by a mere “round
of the docks,” to select 200 new hale men, of all
classes, and strong ones, too, if properly fed, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in a few days would be tolerable street-sweepers.
It is a calling to which agricultural labourers are
glad to resort, and a calling to which <i>any</i>
labourer or any mechanic may resort, more especially
as regards sweeping or scraping, apart from
shovelling, which is regarded as something like
the high art of the business.</p>

<p>We now come to estimate the earnings of the
casual hands, whose yearly incomes must, of
course, be very different from those of the regulars.
The <i>constant</i> weekly wages of any workman
are of course the average of his casual&mdash;and
hence we shall find the wages of those who are
<i>regularly</i> employed far exceed those of the <i>occasionally</i>
employed <span class="lock">men:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>
<p>Hence the difference between the earnings of
the casual and the regular hand would appear to
be one-sixth. But the great evil of all casual
labour is the uncertainty of the income&mdash;for where
there is the greatest chance connected with an employment,
there is not only the greatest necessity
for providence, but unfortunately the greatest tendency
to improvidence. It is only when a man’s
income becomes regular and fixed that he grows
thrifty, and lays by for the future; but where all
is chance-work there is but little ground for reasoning,
and the accident which assisted the man
out of his difficulties at one period is continually
expected to do the same good turn for him at
another. Hence the casual hand, who passes
the half of the year on 18<i>s.</i>, and twenty weeks
on 12<i>s.</i>, and <i>six weeks on nothing</i>, lives a life of
excess both ways&mdash;of excess of “guzzling” when
in work, and excess of privation when out of it&mdash;oscillating,
as it were, between surfeit and starvation.</p>

<p>A man who had worked in an iron-foundry,
but who had “lost his work” (I believe through
some misconduct) and was glad to get employment
as a street-sweeper, as he had a good recommendation
to a contractor, told me that “the misery of
the thing” was the want of regular work. “I’ve
worked,” he said, “for a good master for four
months an end at 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a day, and they were prime
times. Then I hadn’t a stroke of work for a
fortnight, and very little for two months, and if
my wife hadn’t had middling work with a laundress
we might have starved, or I might have made a
hole in the Thames, for it’s no good living to be
miserable and feel you can’t help yourself any
how. We was sometimes half-starved, as it was.
I’d rather at this minute have regular work at
10<i>s.</i> a week all the year round, than have chance-work
that I could earn 20<i>s.</i> a week at. I once
had 15<i>s.</i> in relief from the parish, and a doctor to
attend us, when my wife and I was both laid up
sick. O, there’s no difference in the way of doing
the work, whatever wages you’re on for; the
streets must be swept clean, of course. The plan’s
the same, and there’s the same sort of management,
any how.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of a “Regular Scavager.”</span></h3>

<p>The following statement of his business, his
sentiments, and, indeed, of the subjects which
concerned him, or about which he was questioned,
was given to me by a street-sweeper, so he
called himself, for I have found some of these
men not to relish the appellation of “scavager.”
He was a short, sturdy, somewhat red-faced man,
without anything particular in his appearance to
distinguish him from the mass of mere labourers,
but with the sodden and sometimes dogged look of
a man contented in his ignorance, and&mdash;for it is
not a very uncommon case&mdash;rather proud of it.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how old I am,” he said&mdash;I have
observed, by the by, that there is not any excessive
vulgarity in these men’s tones or accent so
much as grossness in some of their expressions&mdash;“and
I can’t see what that consarns any one, as
I’s old enough to have a jolly rough beard, and so
can take care of myself. I should think so. My
father was a sweeper, and I wanted to be a waterman,
but father&mdash;he hasn’t been dead long&mdash;didn’t
like the thoughts on it, as he said they
was all drownded one time or ’nother; so I ran
away and tried my hand as a Jack-in-the-water,
but I was starved back in a week, and got a <span class="lock">h&mdash;&mdash;</span>
of a clouting. After that I sifted a bit in a
dust-yard, and helped in any way; and I was
sent to help at and larn honey-pot and other
pot making, at Deptford; but honey-pots was a
great thing in the business. Master’s foreman
married a relation of mine, some way or
other. I never tasted honey, but I’ve heered it’s
like sugar and butter mixed. The pots
was often wanted to look like foreign pots; I
don’t know nothing what was meant by it; some
<span class="lock">b&mdash;&mdash;</span> dodge or other. No, the trade didn’t suit
me at all, master, so I left. I don’t know why
it didn’t suit me; cause it didn’t. Just then,
father had hurt his hand and arm, in a jam again’
a cart, and so, as I was a big lad, I got to take his
place, and gave every satisfaction to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.
Yes, he was a contractor and a great man. I
can’t say as I knows how contracting’s done;
but it’s a bargain atween man and man. So I
got on. I’m now looked on as a stunning good
workman, I can tell you.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say as I thinks sweeping the
streets is hard work. I’d rather sweep two hours
than shovel one. It tires one’s arms and back so,
to go on shovelling. You can’t change, you see, sir,
and the same parts keeps getting gripped more and
more. Then you must mind your eye, if you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
shovelling slop into a cart, perticler so; or some
feller may run off with a complaint that he’s been
splashed o’ purpose. <i>Is</i> a man ever splashed o’
purpose? No, sir, not as I knows on, in coorse
not. [Laughing.] Why should he?</p>

<p>“The streets <i>must</i> be done as they’re done now.
It always was so, and will always be so. Did I ever
hear what London streets were like a thousand
years ago? It’s nothing to me, but they must
have been like what they is now. Yes, there
was always streets, or how was people that has
tin to get their coals taken to them, and how was
the public-houses to get their beer? It’s talking
nonsense, talking that way, a-asking sich questions.”
[As the scavager seemed likely to lose his temper,
I changed the subject of conversation.]</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued, “I have good health.
I never had a doctor but twice; once was for a
hurt, and the t’other I won’t tell on. Well, I
think nightwork’s healthful enough, but I’ll not
say so much for it as you may hear some on ’em
say. I don’t like it, but I do it when I’s obligated
under a necessity. It pays one as overwork;
and werry like more one’s in it, more one
may be suited. I reckon no men works harder
nor sich as me. O, as to poor journeymen tailors
and sich like, I knows they’re stunning badly off,
and many of their masters is the hardest of beggars.
I have a nephew as works for a Jew slop,
but I don’t reckon that <i>work</i>; anybody might do
it. You think not, sir? Werry well, it’s all
the same. No, I won’t say as I could make a
veskit, but I’ve sowed my own buttons on to
one afore now.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heered on the Board of Health.
They’ve put down some night-yards, and if they
goes on putting down more, what’s to become of
the night-soil? I can’t think what they’re up to;
but if they don’t touch wages, it may be all
right in the end on it. I don’t know that them
there consarns does touch wages, but one’s naterally
afeard on ’em. I could read a little when I
was a child, but I can’t now for want of practice,
or I might know more about it. I yarns my
money gallows hard, and requires support to do
hard work, and if wages goes down, one’s strength
goes down. I’m a man as understands what
things belongs. I was once out of work, through
a mistake, for a good many weeks, perhaps five
or six or more; I larned then what short grub
meant. I got a drop of beer and a crust sometimes
with men as I knowed, or I might have
dropped in the street. What did I do to pass my
time when I was out of work? Sartinly the days
seemed wery long; but I went about and called at
dust-yards, till I didn’t like to go too often; and
I met men I know’d at tap-rooms, and spent time
that way, and axed if there was any openings for
work. I’ve been out of collar odd weeks now
and then, but when this happened, I’d been
on slack work a goodish bit, and was bad for
rent three weeks and more. My rent was 2<i>s.</i> a
week then; its 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> now, and my own traps.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say I was sorry when I was
forced to be idle that way, that I hadn’t kept up
my reading, nor tried to keep it up, because I
couldn’t then have settled down my mind to
read; I know I couldn’t. I likes to hear the
paper read well enough, if I’s resting; but old
Bill, as often wolunteers to read, has to spell the
hard words so, that one can’t tell what the
devil he’s reading about. I never heers anything
about books; I never heered of Robinson Crusoe,
if it wasn’t once at the Wic. [Victoria Theatre];
I think there was some sich a name there. He
lived on a deserted island, did he, sir, all by hisself?
Well, I think, now you mentions it, I have
heered on him. But one needn’t believe all one
hears, whether out of books or not. I don’t know
much good that ever anybody as I knows ever got
out of books; they’re fittest for idle people.
Sartinly I’ve seen working people reading in
coffee-shops; but they might as well be resting
theirselves to keep up their strength. Do I think
so? I’m sure on it, master. I sometimes spends
a few browns a-going to the play; mostly about
Christmas. It’s werry fine and grand at the
Wic., that’s the place I goes to most; both the
pantomimers and t’ other things is werry stunning.
I can’t say how much I spends a year in
plays; I keeps no account; perhaps 5<i>s.</i> or so in a
year, including expenses, sich as beer, when one
goes out after a stopper on the stage. I don’t
keep no accounts of what I gets, or what I
spends, it would be no use; money comes and it
goes, and it often goes a <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> sight faster than
it comes; so it seems to me, though I ain’t in
debt just at this time.</p>

<p>“I never goes to any church or chapel. Sometimes
I hasn’t clothes as is fit, and I s’pose I
couldn’t be admitted into sich fine places in my
working dress. I was once in a church, but felt
queer, as one does in them strange places, and
never went again. They’re fittest for rich people.
Yes, I’ve heered about religion and about God
Almighty. <i>What</i> religion have I heered on?
Why, the regular religion. I’m satisfied with
what I knows and feels about it, and that’s
enough about it. I came to tell you about trade
and work, because Mr. &mdash;&mdash; told me it might do
good; but religion hasn’t nothing to do with it.
Yes, Mr. <span class="lock">&mdash;&mdash;’s</span> a good master, and a religious
man; but I’ve known masters as didn’t care a
d&mdash;n for religion, as good as him; and so you
see it comes to much the same thing. I cares
nothing about politics neither; but I’m a chartist.</p>

<p>“I’m not a married man. I was a-going to be
married to a young woman as lived with me a
goodish bit as my housekeeper” [this he said very
demurely]; “but she went to the hopping to
yarn a few shillings for herself, and never came
back. I heered that she’d taken up with an
Irish hawker, but I can’t say as to the rights on
it. Did I fret about her? Perhaps not; but I
was wexed.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can’t say what I spends my wages
in. I sometimes makes 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, and
sometimes better than 21<i>s.</i> with night-work. I
suppose grub costs 1<i>s.</i> a day, and beer 6<i>d.</i>; but I
keeps no accounts. I buy ready-cooked meat;
often cold b’iled beef, and eats it at any tap-room.
I have meat every day; mostly more than once a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
day. Wegetables I don’t care about, only ingans
and cabbage, if you can get it smoking hot, with
plenty of pepper. The rest of my tin goes for
rent and baccy and togs, and a little drop of gin
now and then.”</p>

<p>The statement I have given is sufficiently explicit
of the general opinions of the “regular
scavagers” concerning literature, politics, and
religion. On these subjects the great majority of
the regular scavagers have no opinions at all, or
opinions distorted, even when the facts seem clear
and obvious, by ignorance, often united with its
nearest of kin, prejudice and suspiciousness. I
am inclined to think, however, that the man
whose narrative I noted down was more dogged
in his ignorance than the body of his fellows.
All the intelligent men with whom I conversed,
and whose avocations had made them familiar for
years with this class, concurred in representing
them as grossly ignorant.</p>

<p>This description of the scavagers’ ignorance,
&amp;c., it must be remembered, applies only to the
“regular hands.” Those who have joined the
ranks of the street-sweepers from other callings are
more intelligent, and sometimes more temperate.</p>

<p>The system of concubinage, with a great degree
of fidelity in the couple living together without
the sanction of the law&mdash;such as I have
described as prevalent among the costermongers
and dustmen&mdash;is also prevalent among the regular
scavagers.</p>

<p>I did not hear of habitual unkindness from the
parents to the children born out of wedlock,
but there is habitual neglect of all or much which
a child should be taught&mdash;a neglect growing out of
ignorance. I heard of two scavagers with large
families, of whom the treatment was sometimes
very harsh, and at others mere petting.</p>

<p>Education, or rather the ability to read and
write, is not common among the adults in this
calling, so that it cannot be expected to be found
among their children. Some labouring men,
ignorant themselves, but not perhaps constituting
a class or a clique like the regular scavagers, try
hard to procure for their children the knowledge,
the want of which they usually think has barred
their own progress in life. Other ignorant men,
mixing only with “their own sort,” as is generally
the case with the regular scavagers, and in the
several branches of the business, often think and
say that what <i>they</i> did without their children
could do without also. I even heard it said by
one scavager that it wasn’t right a child should
ever think himself wiser than his father. A man
who knew, in the way of his business as a private
contractor for night-work, &amp;c., a great many
regular scavagers, “ran them over,” and came to
the conclusion that about four or five out of
twenty could read, ill or tolerably well, and about
three out of forty could write. He told me, moreover,
that one of the most intelligent fellows generally
whom he knew among them, a man whom
he had heard read well enough, and always understood
to be a tolerable writer, the other day
brought a letter from his son, a soldier abroad with
his regiment in Lower Canada, and requested my
informant to read it to him, as “that kind of
writing,” although plain enough, was “beyond
him.” The son, in writing, had availed himself
of the superior skill of a corporal in his company,
so that the letter, on family matters and feelings,
was written by deputy and read by deputy. The
costermongers, I have shown, when themselves unable
to read, have evinced a fondness for listening
to exciting stories of courts and aristocracies, and
have even bought penny periodicals to have their
contents read to them. The scavagers appear to
have no taste for this mode of enjoying themselves;
but then their leisure is far more circumscribed
than that of the costermongers.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that I have all along
spoken of the regular (many of them hereditary)
scavagers employed by the more liberal contractors.</p>

<p>There are yet accounts of habitations, statements
of wages, &amp;c., &amp;c., to be given, in connection
with men working for the honourable masters,
before proceeding to the scurf-traders.</p>

<p>The working scavagers usually reside in the
neighbourhood of the dust-yards, occupying “second-floor
backs,” kitchens (where the entire house is
sublet, a system often fraught with great extortion),
or garrets; they usually, and perhaps always,
when married, or what they consider “as good,”
have their own furniture. The rent runs from
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> weekly, an average being 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
or 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> One room which I was in was but
barely furnished,&mdash;a sort of dresser, serving also
for a table; a chest; three chairs (one almost
bottomless); an old turn-up bedstead, a Dutch
clock, with the minute-hand broken, or as the
scavager very well called it when he saw me
looking at it, “a stump;” an old “corner cupboard,”
and some pots and domestic utensils in a
closet without a door, but retaining a portion of
the hinges on which a door had swung. The rent
was 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, with a frequent intimation that it
ought to be 2<i>s.</i> The place was clean enough, and
the scavager seemed proud of it, assuring me that
his old woman (wife or concubine) was “a good
sort,” and kept things as nice as ever she could,
washing everything herself, where “other old
women lushed.” The only ornaments in the
room were three profiles of children, cut in black
paper and pasted upon white card, tacked to the
wall over the fire-place, for mantel-shelf there was
none, while one of the three profiles, that of the
eldest child (then dead), was “framed,” with a
glass, and a sort of bronze or “cast” frame, costing,
I was told, 15<i>d.</i> This was the apartment of
a man in regular employ (with but a few exceptions).</p>

<p>Another scavager with whom I had some
conversation about his labours as a nightman, for
he was both, gave me a full account of his own
diet, which I find to be sufficiently specific as to
that of his class generally, but only of the regular
hands.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE LONDON SCAVENGER.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The diet of the regular working scavager (or
nightman) seems generally to differ from that of
mechanics, and perhaps of other working men,
in the respect of his being fonder of salt and
<i>strong-flavoured</i> food. I have before made the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
remark concerning the diet of the poor generally.
I do not mean, however, that the scavagers are
fond of such animal food as is called “high,” for
I did not hear that nightmen or scavagers were
more tolerant of what approached putridity than
other labouring men, and, despite their calling,
might sicken at the rankness of some haunches
of venison; but they have a great relish for
highly-salted cold boiled beef, bacon, or pork, with
a saucer-full of red pickled cabbage, or dingy-looking
pickled onions, or one or two big, strong,
raw onions, of which most of them seem as fond
as Spaniards of garlic. This sort of meat, sometimes
profusely mustarded, is often eaten in the
beer-shops with thick “shives” of bread, cut into
big mouthfuls with a clasp pocket-knife, while
vegetables, unless indeed the beer-shop can supply
a plate of smoking hot potatoes, are uncared for.
The drink is usually beer. The same style of
eating and the same kind of food characterize the
scavager and nightman, when taking his meal at
home with his wife or family; but so irregular,
and often of necessity, are these men’s hours, that
they may be said to have no homes, merely places
to sleep or dose in.</p>

<p>A working scavager and nightman calculated
for me his expenses in eating and drinking, and
other necessaries, for the previous week. He
had earned 15<i>s.</i>, but 1<i>s.</i> of this went to pay off
an advance of 5<i>s.</i> made to him by the keeper of a
beer-shop, or, as he called it, a “jerry.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this informant was excessive in his
drink. I believe he was so; the others not
drinking so much regularly. The odd 9<i>d.</i>, he told
me, he paid to “a snob,” because he said he was
going to send his half-boots to be mended.</p>

<p>This man informed me he was a “widdur,” having
lost his old ’oman, and he got all his meals at a
beer or coffee-shop. Sometimes, when he was a
street-sweeper by day and a nightman by night,
he had earned 20<i>s.</i> to 22<i>s.</i>; and then he could
have his pound of salt meat a day, for <i>three</i> meals,
with a “baked tatur or so, when they was in.”
I inquired as to the apparently low charge of 6<i>d.</i>
per pound for cooked meat, but I found that the
man had stated what was correct. In many parts
good boiled “brisket,” fresh cut, is 7<i>d.</i> and 8<i>d.</i>
per lb., with mustard into the bargain; and the
cook-shop keepers (not the eating-house people)
who sell boiled hams, beef, &amp;c., in retail, but not
to be eaten on the premises, vend the hard remains
of a brisket, and sometimes of a round, for
6<i>d.</i>, or even less (also with mustard), and the
scavagers like this better than any other food. In
the brisk times my informant sometimes had “a
hot cut” from a shop on a Sunday, and a more
liberal allowance of beer and gin. If he had any
piece of clothing to buy he always bought it at
once, before his money went for other things.
These were his proceedings when business was
brisk.</p>

<p>In slacker times his diet was on another
footing. He then made his supper, or second
meal, for tea he seldom touched, on “fagots.”
This preparation of baked meats costs 1<i>d.</i> hot&mdash;but
it is seldom sold hot except in the evening&mdash;and
&frac34;<i>d.</i>, or more frequently two for 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>, cold.
It is a sort of cake, roll, or ball, a number being
baked at a time, and is made of chopped liver
and lights, mixed with gravy, and wrapped in
pieces of pig’s caul. It weighs six ounces, so
that it is unquestionably a cheap, and, to the
scavager, a savoury meal; but to other nostrils
its odour is not seductive. My informant regretted
the capital fagots he used to get at a shop
when he worked in Lambeth; superior to anything
he had been able to meet with on the Middlesex
side of the water. Or he dined off a saveloy,
costing 1<i>d.</i>, and bread; or bought a pennyworth
of strong cheese, and a farthing’s worth of onions.
He would further reduce his daily expenditure on
cocoa (or coffee sometimes) to 1<i>d.</i>, and his bread
to three-quarters of a loaf. He ate, however, in
average times, a quarter of a quartern loaf to his
breakfast (sometimes buying a halfpennyworth of
butter), a quarter or more to his dinner, the same
to his supper, and the other, with an onion for a
relish, to his beer. He was a great bread eater,
he said; but sometimes, if he slept in the daytime,
half a loaf would “stand over to next day.”
He was always hungriest when at work among
the street-mud, or night-soil, or when he had
finished work.</p>

<p>On my asking him if he meant that he partook
of the meals he had described daily, he
answered “no,” but that was <i>mostly</i> what he
had; and if he bought a bit of cold boiled, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
even roast pork, “what offered cheap,” the expense
was about the same. When he was drinking,
and he did “make a break sometimes,” he
ate nothing, and “wasn’t inclined to,” and he
seemed rather to plume himself on this, as a point
of economy. He had tasted fruit pies, but cared
nothing for them; but liked four penn’orth of a
hot meat or giblet pie on a Sunday. Batter-pudding
he only liked if smoking hot; and it was
“uncommon improved,” he said, “with an ingan!”
Rum he preferred to gin, only it was dearer, but
most of the scavagers, he thought, liked Old Tom
(gin) best; but “they was both good.”</p>

<p>Of the drinking of these men I heard a good
deal, and there is no doubt that some of them
tope hard, and by their conduct evince a sort of
belief that the great end of labour is beer. But
it must be borne in mind that if inquiries are
made as to the man best adapted to give information
concerning any rude calling (especially), some
talkative member of the body of these working
men, some pot-house hero who has persuaded
himself and his ignorant mates that he is an
oracle, is put forward. As these men are sometimes,
from being trained to, and long known in
their callings, more prosperous than their fellows,
their opinions seem ratified by their circumstances.
But in such cases, or in the appearance of such
cases, it has been my custom to make subsequent
inquiries, or there might be frequent misleadings,
were the statements of these men taken as typical
of the feelings and habits of the <i>whole</i> body. The
statement of the working scavager given under
this head is unquestionably typical of the character
of a portion of his co-workers, and more
especially of what was, and in the sort of hereditary
scavagers I have spoken of <i>is</i>, the character
of the regular hands. There are now,
however, many checks to prolonged indulgence
in “lush,” as every man of the ruder street-sweeping
class <i>will</i> call it. The contractors must be
served regularly; the most indulgent will not
tolerate any unreasonable absence from work, so
that the working scavagers, at the jeopardy of
their means of living, must leave their carouse at
an hour which will permit them to rise soon
enough in the morning.</p>

<p>The beer which these men imbibe, it should be
also remembered, they regard as a proper part of
their diet, in the same light, indeed, as they regard
so much bread, and that among them the opinion
is almost universal, that beer is necessary to
“keep up their strength;” there are a few teetotallers
belonging to the class; one man thought he
<i>knew</i> five, and had <i>heard</i> of five others.</p>

<p>I inquired of the landlord of a beer-shop, frequented
by these men, as to their potations, but he
wanted to make it appear that they took a half-pint,
<i>now and then</i>, when thirsty! He was evidently
tender of the character of his customers. The landlord
of a public house also frequented by them informed
me that he really could not say what they
expended in beer, for labourers of all kinds “used
his tap,” and as all tap-room liquor was paid for
on delivery in his and all similar establishments,
he did not know the quantity supplied to any
particular class. He was satisfied these men, as
a whole, drank less than they did at one time;
though he had no doubt some (he seemed to know
no distinctions between scavagers, dustmen, and
nightmen) spent 1<i>s.</i> a day in drink. He knew
one scavager who was dozing about not long
since for nearly a week, “sleepy drunk,” and the
belief was that he had “found something.” The
absence of all accounts prevents my coming to
anything definite on this head, but it seems positive
that these men drink less than they did. The
landlord in question thought the statement I have
given as to diet and drink perfectly correct for a
regular hand in good earnings. I am assured,
however, and it is my own opinion, after long inquiry,
that one-third of their earnings is spent
in drink.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Influence of Free Trade on the
Earnings of the Scavagers.</span></h3>

<p>As regards the influence of Free Trade upon
the scavaging business, I could gain little or no
information from the body of street-sweepers,
because they have never noticed its operation, and
the men, with the exception of such as have sunk
into street-sweeping from better-informed conditions
of life, know nothing about it. Among <i>all</i>,
however, I have heard statements of the blessing
of cheap bread; always cheap <i>bread</i>. “There’s
nothing like bread,” say the men, “it’s not all
poor people can get meat; but they <i>must</i> get
bread.” Cheap food all labouring men pronounce
a blessing, as it unquestionably is, but “somehow,”
as a scavager’s carman said to me, “the
thing ain’t working as it should.”</p>

<p>In the course of the present and former inquiries
among unskilled labourers, street-sellers,
and costermongers, I have found the great
majority of the more intelligent declare that
Free Trade had not worked well for them,
because there were more labourers and more
street-sellers than were required, for each man to
live by his toil and traffic, and because the numbers
increased yearly, and the demand for their
commodities did not increase in proportion. Among
the ignorant, I heard the continual answers of, “I
can’t say, sir, what it’s owing to, that I’m so
bad off;” or, “Well, I can’t tell anything about
that.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to state, however, without positive
inquiry, whether this extra number of hands be
due to diminished employment in the agricultural
districts, since the repeal of the Corn Laws, or
whether it be due to the insufficiency of occupation
generally for the increasing population.
One thing at least is evident, that the increase of
the trades alluded to cannot be said to arise
directly from diminished agricultural employment,
for but few farm labourers have entered these
businesses since the change from Protection to Free
Trade. If, therefore, Free-Trade principles <i>have</i>
operated injuriously in reducing the work of the
unskilled labourers, street-sellers, and the poorer
classes generally, it can have done so only <i>indirectly</i>;
that is to say, by throwing a mass of
displaced country labour into the towns, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
displacing other labourers from their ordinary
occupations, as well as by decreasing the wages
of working-men generally. Hence it becomes
almost impossible, I repeat, to tell whether the
increasing difficulty that the poor experience in
living by their labour, is a consequence or merely
a concomitant of the repeal of the Corn Laws; if
it be a consequence, of course the poor are no
better for the alteration; if, however, it be a
coincidence rather than a necessary result of the
measure, the circumstances of the poor are, of
course, as much improved as they would have been
impoverished provided that measure had never
become law. I candidly confess I am as yet
without the means of coming to any conclusion on
this part of the subject.</p>

<p>Nor can it be said that in the scavagers’ trade
wages have in any way declined since the repeal
of the Corn Laws; so that were it not for the
difficulty of obtaining employment among the
<i>casual</i> hands, this class must be allowed to have
been considerable gainers by the reduction in the
price of food, and even as it is, the <i>constant</i> hands
must be acknowledged to be so.</p>

<p>I will now endeavour to reduce to a tabular
form such information as I could obtain as to the
expenditure of the labourer in scavaging before
and after the establishment of Free Trade. I
inquired, the better to be assured of the accuracy
of the representations and accounts I received
from labourers, the price of meat then and now.
A butcher who for many years has conducted a
business in a populous part of Westminster and in a
populous suburb, supplying both private families
with the best joints, and the poor with their
“little bits” their “block ornaments” (meat in
small pieces exposed on the chopping-block), their
purchases of liver, and of beasts’ heads. In 1845,
the year I take as sufficiently prior to the Free-Trade
era, my informant from his recollection of
the state of his business and from consulting his
books, which of course were a correct guide, found
that for a portion of the year in question, mutton
was as much as 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> per lb. (Smithfield prices),
now the same quality of meat is but 5<i>d.</i> This,
however, was but a temporary matter, and from
causes which sometimes are not very ostensible or
explicable. Taking the butcher’s trade that year
as a whole, it was found sufficiently conclusive,
that meat was generally 1<i>d.</i> per lb. higher then
than at present. My informant, however, was
perfectly satisfied that, although situated in the
same way, and with the same class of customers,
he did <i>not</i> sell so much meat to the poor and
labouring classes as he did five or six years ago,
<i>he believed not by one-eighth</i>, although perhaps
“pricers of his meat” among the poor were more
numerous. For this my informant accounted
by expressing his conviction that the labouring
men spent their money in drink more than ever,
and were a longer time in recovering from the
effects of tippling. This supposition, from what I
have observed in the course of the present inquiry,
is negatived by facts.</p>

<p>Another butcher, also supplying the poor, said
they bought less of him; but he could not say
exactly to what extent, perhaps an eighth, and he
attributed it to less work, there being no railways
about London, fewer buildings, and less general
employment. About the wages of the labourers
he could not speak as influencing the matter.
From this tradesmen also I received an account
that meat generally was 1<i>d.</i> per lb. higher at the
time specified. Pickled Australian beef was four or
five years ago very low&mdash;3<i>d.</i> per lb.&mdash;salted and
prepared, and “swelling” in hot water, but the
poor “couldn’t eat the stringy stuff, for it was like
pickled ropes.” “It’s better now,” he added,
“but it don’t sell, and there’s no nourishment in
such beef.”</p>

<p>But these tradesmen agreed in the information
that poor labourers bought less meat, while one
pronounced Free Trade a blessing, the other declared
it a curse. I suggested to each that cheaper
fish might have something to do with a smaller
consumption of butcher’s meat, but both said that
cheap fish was the great thing for the Irish and
the poor needle-women and the like, who were
never at any time meat eaters.</p>

<p>From respectable bakers I ascertained that
bread might be considered 1<i>d.</i> a quartern loaf
dearer in 1845 than at present. Perhaps the following
table may throw a fuller light on the matter.
I give it from what I learned from several men,
who were without accounts to refer to, but speaking
positively from memory; I give the statement
per week, as for a single man, without charge
for the support of a wife and family, and without
any help from other resources.</p>

<p>In butter, bacon, potatoes, &amp;c., and beer, I
could hear of no changes, except that bacon might
be a trifle cheaper, but instead of a good quality
selling better, although cheaper, there was a demand
for an inferior sort.</p>

<p>In the foregoing table the weekly consumption
of several necessaries is given, but it is not to be
understood that one man consumes them all in a
week; they are what may generally be consumed
when such things are in demand by the poor, one
week after another, or one day after another,
forming an aggregate of weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, Free Trade and cheap provisions are an
unquestionable benefit, if unaffected by drawbacks,
to the labouring poor.</p>

<p>The above statement refers only to a fully employed
hand.</p>

<p>The following table gives the change since
Free Trade in the earnings of casual hands, and
relates to the past and the present expenditure of a

<p>Here, then, we find a positive saving in the expenditure

<p>Thus we perceive that the beneficial effects of
cheapness are defeated by the dearth of employment
among labourers.</p>

<p>It is impossible to come to <i>precise</i> statistics in
this matter, but all concurrent evidence, as regards
the unskilled work of which I now treat, shows
that labour is attainable at almost any rate.</p>

<p>Another drawback to the benefits of cheap food
I heard of first in my inquiries (for the Letters on
Labour and the Poor, in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>)
among the boot and shoemakers&mdash;their rents had
been raised in consequence of their landlords’
property having been subjected to the income
tax. Numbers of large houses are now let out
in single rooms, in the streets off Tottenham-court-road,
and near Golden-square, as well as
in many other quarters&mdash;to men, who, working
for West-end tradesmen, must live, for economy of
time, near the shops from which they derive their
work. Near and in Cunningham-street and other
streets, two men, father and son, rent upwards of
30 houses, the whole of which they let out in one
or two rooms, it is believed at a very great
profit; in fact they live by it.</p>

<p>The rent of these houses, among many others,
was raised when the income tax was imposed, the
sub-lettors declaring, with what truth no one
knew, that the rents were raised to them. It is
common enough for capitalists to fling such imposts
on the shoulders of the poor, and I heard
scavagers complain, that every time they had to
change their rooms, they had either to pay more
rent by 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> a week, or put up with a
worse place. One man who lived at the time of
the passing of the Income Tax Bill in Shoe-lane,
found his rent raised suddenly 3<i>d.</i> a week, a non-resident
landlord or agent calling for it weekly.
He was told that the advance was to meet the income
tax. “I know nothing about what income tax
means,” he said, “but it’s some &mdash;&mdash; roguery as is
put on the poor.” I heard complaints to the same
purport from several working scavagers, and the
lettors of rooms are the most exacting in places
crowded with the poor, and where the poor think
or feel they must reside “to be handy for work.”
What connection there may be between the questions
of Free Trade and the necessity of the income
tax, it is not my business now to dilate
upon, but it is evident that the circumstances of
the country are not sufficiently prosperous to
enable parliament to repeal this “temporary”
impost.</p>

<p>From a better informed class than the scavagers,
I might have derived data on which to form
a calculation from account books, &amp;c., but I
could hear of none being kept. I remember
that a lady’s shoemaker told me that the weekly
rents of the ten rooms in the house in which he
lived were 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> higher than before the income
tax, which “came to the same thing as an extra
penny on over 50 loaves a week.” It is certain
that the great tax-payers of London are the
labouring classes.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to ascertain the facts in
connection with this complex subject in as calm
and just a manner as possible, leaning neither to
the Protectionist nor the Free-Trade side of the
question, and I must again in honesty acknowledge,
that to the <i>constant</i> hands among the
scavagers and dustmen of the metropolis, the
repeal of the Corn Laws appears to have been an
unquestionable benefit.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this exposition of the condition
and earnings of the working scavagers employed
by the more honourable masters, with an account
of the average income and expenditure of the
better-paid hands (regular and casual, as well as
single and married), and first, of the unmarried
regular hand.</p>

<p>The expenditure of this man when in work was
nearly the same as that of the regular hand; the
main exceptions being that his rent was 1<i>s.</i> instead
of 2<i>s.</i>, and no dogs were kept. When in work he
saved nothing, and when out of work lived as he
could.</p>

<p>The <i>married</i> scavagers are differently circumstanced
from the <i>unmarried</i>; their earnings are
generally increased by those of their family.</p>

<p>The labour of the wives and children of the
scavagers is not unfrequently in the capacity of
sifters in the dust-yards, where the wives of the
men employed by the contractors have the preference,
and in other but somewhat rude capacities.
One of their wives I heard of as a dresser of
sheep’s trotters; two as being among the most
skilful dressers of tripe for a large shop; one as
“a cat’s-meat seller” (her father’s calling); but I
still speak of the regular scavagers&mdash;I could not
meet with one woman “working a slop-needle.”
One, indeed, I saw who was described to me as a
“feather dresser to an out-and-out negur,” but the
woman assured me she was neither badly paid nor
badly off. Perhaps by such labour, as an average
on the part of the wives, 9<i>d.</i> a day is cleared,
and 1<i>s.</i> “on tripe and such like.” Among the
“casual’s” wives there are frequent instances of
the working for slop shirt-makers, &amp;c., upon the
coarser sorts of work, and at “starvation wages,”
but on such matters I have often dwelt. I
heard from some of these men that it was looked
upon as a great thing if the wife’s labour could
clear the week’s rent of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The following may be taken as an estimate of
the income and outlay of a <i>better paid and fully</i>
employed operative scavager, with his wife and two
<span class="lock">children:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Worse Paid Scavagers, or those
working for Scurf<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Employers.</span></h3>

<p>There are in the scavagers’ trade the same distinct
classes of employers as appertain to all other
trades; these consist <span class="lock">of:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. The large capitalists.</li>
<li>2. The small capitalists.</li>
</ul>


<p>As a rule (with some few honourable and dishonourable
exceptions, it is true) I find that the
large capitalists in the several trades are generally
the employers who pay the higher wages, and the
small men those who pay the lower. The reasons
for this conduct are almost obvious. The power
of the capital of the “large master” must be
contended against by the small one; and the
usual mode of contention in all trades is by reducing
the wages of the working men. The
wealthy master has, of course, many advantages
over the poor one. (1) He can pay ready money,
and obtain discounts for immediate payment.
(2) He can buy in large quantities, and so get
his stock cheaper. (3) He can purchase what he
wants in the best markets, and that <i>directly</i> of
the producer, without the intervention and profit
of the middleman. (4) He can buy at the best
times and seasons; and “lay in” what he requires
for the purposes of his trade long before
it is needed, provided he can obtain it “a bargain.”
(5) He can avail himself of the best
tools and mechanical contrivances for increasing
the productiveness or “economizing the labour”
of his workmen. (6) He can build and arrange
his places of work upon the most approved plan
and in the best situations for the manufacture and
distribution of the commodities. (7) He can
employ the highest talent for the management or
design of the work on which he is engaged. (8)
He can institute a more effective system for
the surveillance and checking of his workmen.
(9) He can employ a large number of hands, and
so reduce the secondary expenses (of firing, lighting,
&amp;c.) attendant upon the work, as well as the
number of superintendents and others engaged to
“look after” the operatives. (10) He can resort
to extensive means of making his trade known.
(11) He can sell cheaper (even if his cost of production
be the same), from employing a larger
capital, and being able to “do with” a less rate
of profit. (12) He can afford to give credit, and
so obtain customers that he might otherwise
lose.</p>

<p>The small capitalist, therefore, enters the field
of competition by no means equally matched
against his more wealthy rival. What the little
master wants in “substance,” however, he generally
endeavours to make up in cunning. If he
cannot buy his materials as cheap as a trader of
larger means, he uses an inferior or cheaper
article, and seeks by some trick or other to palm
it off as equal to the superior and dearer kind.
If the tools and appliances of the trade are expensive,
he either transfers the cost of providing them
to the workmen, or else he charges them a rent
for their use; and so with the places of work, he
mulcts their wages of a certain sum per week for
the gas by which they labour, or he makes them
do their work at home, and thus saves the expense
of a workshop; and, lastly, he pays his men
either a less sum than usual for the same quantity
of labour, or exacts a greater quantity from them
for the same sum of money. By one or other of
these means does the man of limited capital seek
to counterbalance the advantages which his more
wealthy rival obtains by the possession of extensive
“resources.” The large employer is enabled
to work cheaper by the sheer force of his larger
capital. He reduces the cost of production, not
by employing a cheaper labour, but by “economizing
the labour” that he does employ. The
small employer, on the other hand, seeks to keep
pace with his larger rival, and strives to work
cheap, not by “the economy of labour” (for this
is hardly possible in the small way of production),
but by reducing the wages of his labourers.
Hence the <i>rule</i> in almost every trade is that the
smaller capitalists pay a lower rate of wages.
To this, however, there are many honourable exceptions
among the small masters, and many as
dishonourable among the larger ones in different
trades. Messrs. Moses, Nicoll, and Hyams, for
instance, are men who certainly cannot plead
deficiency of means as an excuse for reducing the
ordinary rate of wages among the tailors.</p>

<p>Those employers who seek to reduce the prices
of a trade are known technologically as “<i>cutting
employers</i>,” in contradistinction to the standard
employers, or those who pay their workpeople and
sell their goods at the ordinary rates.</p>

<p>Of “cutting employers” there are several kinds,
differently designated, according to the different
means by which they gain their ends. These
<span class="lock">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>1. “<i>Drivers</i>,” or those who compel the men in
their employ to do more work for the same wages;
of this kind there are two distinct <span class="lock">varieties:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a.</i> <i>The long-hour masters</i>, or those who make
the men work longer than the usual hours
of labour.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>The strapping masters</i>, or those who make
the men (by extra supervision) “strap” to
their work, so as to do a greater quantity
of labour in the usual time.</p></div>

<p>2. <i>Grinders</i>, or those who compel the workmen
(through their necessities) to do the same
amount of work for less than the ordinary
wages.</p>

<p>The reduction of wages thus brought about
may or may not be attended with a corresponding
reduction in the price of the goods
to the public; if the price of the goods
be reduced in proportion to the reduction of
wages, the consumer, of course, is benefited at
the expense of the producer. When it is not
followed by a like diminution in the selling price
of the article, and the wages of which the men
are mulct go to increase the profits of the capitalist,
the employer alone is benefited, and is then
known as a “<i>grasper</i>.”</p>

<p>Some cutting tradesmen, however, endeavour to
undersell their more wealthy rivals, by reducing
the ordinary rate of profit, and extending their
business on the principle of small profits and
quick returns, the “nimble ninepence” being considered
“better than the slow shilling.” Such
traders, of course, cannot be said to reduce wages
directly&mdash;indirectly, however, they have the same
effect, for in reducing prices, other traders, ever
ready to compete with them, but, unwilling, or
perhaps unable, to accept less than the ordinary
rate of profit, seek to attain the same cheapness
by diminishing the cost of production, and for
this end the labourers’ wages are almost invariably
reduced.</p>

<p>Such are the characteristics of the cheap employers
in all trades. Let me now proceed to
point out the peculiarities of what are called the
scurf employers in the scavaging trade.</p>

<p>The insidious practices of capitalists in other
callings, in reducing the hire of labour, are not
unknown to the scavagers. The evils of which
these workmen have to complain under scurf or
slop masters <span class="lock">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Driving</i>, or being compelled to do more
work for the <i>same pay</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Grinding</i>, or being compelled to do the
same or a greater amount of work for <i>less pay</i>.</p>

<p>1. Under the first head, if the employment be
at all regular, I heard few complaints, for the men
seemed to have learned to look upon it as an inevitable
thing, that one way or other they <i>must</i>
submit, by the receipt of a reduced wage, or the
exercise of a greater toil, to a deterioration in
their means.</p>

<p>The system of driving, or, in other words, the
means by which extra work is got out of the men
for the same remuneration, in the scavagers’ trade
is as follows:&mdash;some employers cause their scavagers
after their day’s work in the streets, to
load the barges with the street and house-collected
manure, without any additional payment;
whereas, among the more liberal employers, there
are bargemen who are employed to attend to this
department of the trade, and if their street scavagers
<i>are</i> so employed, which is not very often,
it is computed as extra work or “over hours,”
and paid for accordingly. This same indirect
mode of reducing wages (by getting more work done
for the same pay) is seen in many piece-work
callings. The slop boot and shoe makers pay the
same price as they did six or seven years ago, but
they have “knocked off the extras,” as the additional
allowance for greater than the ordinary
height of heel, and the like. So the slop Mayor
of Manchester, Sir Elkanah Armitage, within the
last year or two, sought to obtain from his men a
greater length of “cut” to each piece of woven
for the same wages.</p>

<p>Some master scavagers or contractors, moreover,
reduce wages by making their men do what is considered
the work of “a man and a half” in a week,
without the recompense due for the labour of the
“half” man’s work; in other words, they require
the men to condense eight or nine days’ labour
into six, and to be paid for the six days only;
this again is usual in the strapping shops of the
carpenters’ trade.</p>

<p>Thus the class of street-sweepers do not differ
materially in the circumstances of their position
from other bodies of workers skilled and unskilled.</p>

<p>Let me, however, give a practical illustration of
the loss accruing to the working scavagers by the
<i>driving</i> method of reducing wages.</p>

<p>A is a large contractor and a driver. He employs
16 men, and pays them the “regular wages”
of the honourable trade; but, instead of limiting
the hours of labour to 12, as is usual among the
better class of employers, he compels each of his
men to work at the least 16 hours per diem,
which is one-third more, and for which the men
should receive one-third more wages. Let us see,
therefore, how much the men in his employ lose
annually by these means.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th colspan="2">Sum received per Annum.</th><th colspan="2">Sum they should receive.</th><th colspan="2">Difference.</th></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>£</td><td><i>s.</i></td><td>£</td><td><i>s.</i></td><td>£</td><td><i>s.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">4 Gangers, at 18<i>s.</i> a week, for 9 months in the year</td><td>140</td><td>8</td><td>210</td><td>12</td><td>70</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">12 Sweepers, at 16<i>s.</i> a week, for 9 months in the year</td><td>374</td><td>8</td><td>499</td><td>4</td><td>124</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total wages per Ann.</td><td class="total">514</td><td class="total">16</td><td class="total">709</td><td class="total">16</td><td class="total">195</td><td class="total">0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here, then, we find the annual loss to these
men through the system of “driving” to be 195<i>l.</i>
per annum.</p>

<p>But A is not the only driver in the scavagers’
trade; out of the 19 masters having contracts
for scavaging, as cited in the table given at pp.
<a href="#Page_212">213, 214</a>, there are 4 who are regular drivers;
and, making the same calculation as above, we
have the following <span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th colspan="2">Sum received per Annum.</th><th colspan="2">Sum they should receive.</th><th colspan="2">Difference.</th></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>£</td><td><i>s.</i></td><td>£</td><td><i>s.</i></td><td>£</td><td><i>s.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">26 Gangers, at 18<i>s.</i> a week, for 9 months in the year</td><td>912</td><td>12</td><td>1216</td><td>16</td><td>304</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">80 Sweepers, at 16<i>s.</i> a week, for 9 months in the year</td><td>2496</td><td>0</td><td>3328</td><td>0</td><td>832</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td  class="total">3308</td><td class="total">12</td><td class="total">4544</td><td class="total">16</td><td class="total">1136</td><td class="total">4</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus we find that the gross sum of which the
men employed by these drivers are deprived, is
no less than 1136<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>2. The second or indirect mode of reducing
the wages of the men in the scavaging trade is by
<i>Grinding</i>; that is to say, by making the men do
the same amount of work for less pay. It requires
nothing but a practical illustration to render
the injury of this particular mode of reduction
apparent to the public.</p>

<p>B is a master scavager (a small contractor,
though the instances are not confined to this class),
and a “<i>Grinder</i>.” He pays 1<i>s.</i> a week less than
the “regular wages” of the honourable trade. He
employs six men; hence the amount that the
workmen in his pay are mulct of every year is as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Here the loss to the men is 11<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> per annum,
and there is but one such grinder among the 19
master scavagers who have contracts at present.</p>

<p>3. The third and last method of reducing the
earnings of the men as above enumerated, is by
a combination of both the systems before explained,
viz., by <i>grinding</i> and <i>driving</i> united, that is to
say, by not only paying the men a smaller wage
than the more honourable masters, but by compelling
them to work longer hours as well. Let me
cite another illustration from the trade.</p>

<p>C is a large contractor, and both a grinder and
driver. He employs 28 men, and not only pays them
less wages, but makes them work longer hours than
the better class of employers. The men in his
pay, therefore, are annually mulct of the following
sums.</p>

7 employers who are both grinders and

111 hands; hence, the gross amount of which their

<p>Now this is a large sum of money to be wrested
annually out of the workmen&mdash;that it is so
wrested is demonstrated by the fact cited at
p. <a href="#Page_174">174</a> in connection with the dust trade.</p>

<p>The wages of the dustmen employed by the
large contractors, it is there stated, have been
increased within the last seven years from 6<i>d.</i>
to 8<i>d.</i> per load. This increase in the rate of remuneration
was owing to complaints made by the
men to the Commissioners of Sewers, that they
were not able to live on their earnings; an inquiry
took place, and the result was that the
Commissioners decided upon letting the contracts
only to such parties as would undertake to pay
a fair price to their workmen. The contractors
accordingly increased the remuneration of the
labourers as mentioned.</p>

<p>Now political economy would tell us that the
Commissioners <i>interfered</i> with wages in a most
reprehensible manner&mdash;preventing the natural
operation of the law of Supply and Demand; but
both justice and benevolence assure us that the
Commissioners did perfectly right. The masters
in the dust trade were forced to make good to the
men what they had previously taken from them,
and the same should be done in the scavaging
trade&mdash;the contracts should be let only to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
masters who will undertake to pay the regular
rate of wages, and employ their men only the regular
hours; for by such means, and by such means
alone, can <i>justice</i> be done to the operatives.</p>

<p>This brings me to the <i>cause of the reduction of
wages in the scavaging trade</i>. The scurf trade,
I am informed, has been carried on among the
master scavagers upwards of 20 years, and arose
partly from the contractors having <i>to pay</i> the
parishes for the house-dust and street-sweepings,
brieze and street manure at that period often selling
for 30<i>s.</i> the chaldron or load. The demand
for this kind of manure 20 years ago was so
great, that there was a competition carried on
among the contractors themselves, each out-bidding
the other, so as to obtain the right of collecting it;
and in order not to lose anything by the large
sums which they were induced to bid for the contracts,
the employers began gradually to “grind
down” their men from 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (the sum paid 20
years back) to 17<i>s.</i> a week, and eventually to 15<i>s.</i>,
and even 12<i>s.</i> weekly. This is a curious and instructive
fact, as showing that even an increase of
prices will, <i>under the contract system</i>, induce a reduction
of wages. The greed of traders becomes,
it appears, from the very height of the prices, proportionally
intensified, and from the desire of each
to reap the benefit, they are led to outbid one
another to such an extent, and to offer such large
premiums for the right of appropriation, as to
necessitate a reduction of every possible expense
in order to make any profit at all upon the transaction.
Owing, moreover, to the surplus labour in
the trade, the contractors were enabled to offer
any premiums and reduce wages as they pleased;
for the casually-employed men, when the wet
season was over, and their services no longer required,
were continually calling upon the contractors,
and offering their services at 2<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i>
less per week than the regular hands were receiving.
The consequence was, that five or six
of the master scavagers began to reduce the wages
of their labourers, and since that time the number
has been gradually increasing, until now there
are no less than 21 scurf masters (8 of whom have
no contracts) out of the 34 contractors; so that
nearly three-fifths of the entire trade belong to
the <i>grinding</i> class. Within the last seven or eight
years, however, there has been an increase of
wages in connection with the city operative scavagers.
This was owing mainly to the operatives
complaining to the Commissioners that they could
not live upon the wages they were then receiving&mdash;12<i>s.</i>
and 14<i>s.</i> a week. The circumstances inducing
the change, I am informed, were as follows:&mdash;one
of the gangers asked a tradesman in the city
to give the street-sweepers “something for beer,”
whereupon the tradesman inquired if the men
could not find beer out of their wages, and on
being assured that they were receiving only 12<i>s.</i> a
week, he had the matter brought before the Board.
The result was, that the wages of the operatives
were increased from 12<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> and 16<i>s.</i> weekly,
since which time there has been neither an increase
nor a decrease in their pay. The cheapness of provisions
seems to have caused no reduction with them.</p>

<p>Now there are but two “efficient causes” to
account for the reduction of wages among the
scurf employers in the scavagers’ trade:&mdash;(1)
The employers may diminish the pay of their
men from a disposition to “<i>grind</i>” out of them
an inordinate rate of profit. (2) The price
paid for the work may be so reduced that, consistent
with the ordinary rate of profit on
capital, and remuneration for superintendence,
greater wages cannot be paid. If the first be the
fact, then the employers are to blame, and the
parishes should follow the example of the Commissioners
of Sewers, and let the work to those
contractors only who will undertake to pay the
“regular wages” of the honourable trade; but if
the latter be the case, as I strongly suspect it is,
though some of the masters seem to be more
“grasping” than the rest&mdash;but in the paucity of
returns on this matter, it is difficult to state
positively whether the price paid for the labour of
the working scavager is in all the parishes proportional
to the price paid to the employers for the
work (a most important fact to be solved)&mdash;if,
however, I repeat, the decrease of the wages be
mainly due to the decrease in the sums given for
the performance of the contract, then the parishes
are to blame for seeking to get their work done
<i>at the expense of the working men</i>.</p>

<p>The contract system of work, I find, necessarily
tends to this diminution of the men’s earnings in a
trade. Offer a certain quantity of work to the
lowest bidder, and the competition will assuredly
be maintained at <i>the operative’s expense</i>. It is
idle to expect that, as a general rule, traders will
take less than the ordinary rate of profit. Hence,
he who underbids will usually be found to underpay.
This, indeed, is almost a necessity of the
system, and one which the parochial functionaries
more than all others should be guarded against&mdash;seeing
that a decrease of the operative’s wages can
but be attended with an increase of the very
paupers, and consequently of the parochial expenses,
which they are striving to reduce.</p>

<p>A labourer, in order to be self-supporting and
avoid becoming a “burden” on the parish, requires
something more than bare subsistence-money
in remuneration for his labour, and yet
this is generally the mode by which we test the
<i>sufficiency of wages</i>. “A man can live very comfortably
upon that!” is the exclamation of those
who have seldom thought upon what constitutes
the <i>minimum</i> of self-support in this country. A
man’s wages, to prevent pauperism, should include,
besides present subsistence, what Dr. Chalmers
has called “his secondaries;” viz., a sufficiency to
pay for his maintenance: 1st, during the slack
season; 2nd, when out of employment; 3rd,
when ill; 4th, when old<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. If insufficient to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
this, it is evident that the man at such times must
seek parochial relief; and it is by the reduction of
wages down to bare subsistence, that the cheap
employers of the present day shift the burden of
supporting their labourers when unemployed on
to the parish; thus virtually perpetuating the
allowance system or relief in aid of wages under
the old Poor Law. Formerly the mode of hiring
labourers was by the year, so that the employer
was bound to maintain the men when unemployed.
But now journey-work, or hiring by the day, prevails,
and the labourers being paid&mdash;and that mere
subsistence-money&mdash;only when wanted, are necessitated
to become either paupers or thieves
when their services are no longer required. It is,
moreover, this change from yearly to daily hirings,
and the consequent discarding of men when no
longer required, that has partly caused the immense
mass of surplus labourers, who are continually
vagabondizing through the country begging or
stealing as they go&mdash;men for whom there is but
some two or three weeks’ work (harvesting, hop-picking,
and the like) throughout the year.</p>

<p>That there is, however, a large system of <i>jobbing
pursued by the contractors</i> for the house-dust
and cleansing of the streets, there cannot be the
least doubt. The minute I have cited at page <a href="#Page_210">210</a>
gives us a slight insight into the system of combination
existing among the employers, and the extraordinary
fluctuations in the prices obtained by
the contractors would lead to the notion that the
business was more a system of gambling than
trade. The following returns have been procured
by Mr. Cochrane within the last few <span class="lock">days:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A more specific and later return is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>“From the above return,” says Mr. Cochrane,
“it may be <i>inferred</i> that the annual sums paid
for cleansing in each year of 1844 and 1843 did
not exceed 2281<i>l.</i>, as this would make up the
eight years’ average calculation of 4643<i>l.</i>”</p>

<p>Since the streets have been cleansed daily, it
will be seen that the average has been 7188<i>l.</i>
The smallest amount, in 1846, was 6034<i>l.</i>; and
the largest, in 1847, 8014<i>l.</i>; which was a sudden
increase of 1980<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Here, then, we perceive an immediate increase in
the price paid for scavaging between 1846 and
1847 of nearly 33 per cent., and since the wages
of the workmen were not proportionately increased
in the latter year by the employers, it follows that
the profits of the contractors must have been
augmented to that enormous extent. The only
effectual mode of preventing this system of jobbing
being persevered in, <i>at the expense of the workmen</i>,
is by the insertion of a clause in each parish
contract similar to that introduced by the Commissioners
of Sewers&mdash;that at least a fair living
rate of wages shall be paid by each contractor to
the men employed by him. This may be an interference
with the freedom of labour, according
to the economists’ “cant” language, but at least
it is a restriction of the tyranny of capital, for free
labour means, when literally translated, <i>the unrestricted
use of capital</i>, which is (especially when
the moral standard of trade is not of the highest
character) perhaps the greatest evil with which a
State can be afflicted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let me now speak of the <i>Scurf labourers</i>. The
moral and social characteristics of the working
scavagers who labour for a lower rate of hire do
not materially differ from those of the better paid
and more regularly employed body, unless, perhaps,
in this respect, that there are among them a greater
proportion of the “casuals,” or of men reared to
the pursuit of other callings, and driven by want,
misfortune, or misconduct, to “sweep the streets;”
and not only that, but to regard the “leave to
toil” in such a capacity a boon. These constitute,
as it were, the cheap labourers of this trade.</p>

<p>Among the parties concerned in the lower-priced
scavaging, are the usual criminations. The
parish authorities will not put up any longer with
the extortions of the contractors. The contractors
cannot put up any longer with the stinginess of
the parishes. The <i>working</i> scavagers, upon whose
shoulders the burthen falls the heaviest&mdash;as it does
in all depreciated tradings&mdash;grumble at both. I
cannot aver, however, that I found among the men
that bitter hatred of their masters which I found
actuating the mass of operative tailors, shoemakers,
dressmakers, &amp;c., toward the slop capitalists who
employed them.</p>

<p>I have pointed out in what the “scurf” treatment
of the labourers was chiefly manifested&mdash;in
extra work for inferior pay; in doing eight or
nine days’ work in six; and in being paid for only
six days’ labour, and not always at the ordinary rate
even for the lighter toil&mdash;not 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, but 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or
even 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a day. To the wealthy, this 2<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i>
a day may seem but a trifling matter, but I heard a
working scavager (formerly a house-painter) put it
in a strong light: “that 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> a day, sir, is
a poor family’s rent.” The rent, I may observe,
as a result of my inquiries among the more decent
classes of labourers, is often the primary consideration:
“You see, sir, we must have a roof
over our heads.”</p>

<p>A scavager, working for a scurf master, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
me the following account. He was a middle-aged
man, decently dressed, for when I saw him, he
was in his “Sunday clothes,” and was quiet in his
tones, even when he spoke bitterly.</p>

<p>“My father,” he said, “was once in business
as a butcher, but he failed, and was afterwards
a journeyman butcher, but very much respected,
I know, and I used to job and help him. O dear,
yes! I can read and write, but I have very seldom
to write, only I think one never forgets it, it’s
like learning to swim, that way; and I read
sometimes at coffee-shops. My father died rather
sudden, and me and a brother had to look out.
My brother was older than me, he was 20 or 21
then, and he went for a soldier, I believe to some
of the Ingees, but I’ve never heard of him since.
I got a place in a knacker’s yard, but I didn’t
like it at all, <i>it was so confining</i>, and should have
hooked it, only I left it honourable. I can’t call
to mind how long that’s back, perhaps 16 or 18
years, but I know there was some stir at the time
about having the streets and yards cleaner. A
man called and had some talk with the governor,
and says he, says the governor, says he, ‘if
you want a handy lad with his besom, and
he’s good for nothing else’&mdash;but that was his
gammon&mdash;‘here’s your man;’ so I was engaged
as a young sweeper at 10<i>s.</i> a week. I worked
in Hackney, but I heard so much about railways,
that I saved my money up to 10<i>s.</i>, and popped
[pledged] a suit of mourning I’d got after my
father’s death for 22<i>s.</i>, and got to York, both on
foot and with lifts. I soon got work on a rail;
there was great call for rails then, but I don’t
know how long it’s since, and I was a navvy for
six or seven years, or better. Then I came back
to London. I don’t know just what made me
come back, <i>but I was restless</i>, and I thought I
could get work as easy in London as in the
country, but I couldn’t. I brought 21 gold
sovereigns with me to London, twisted in my fob
for safeness, in a wash-leather bag. They didn’t
last so long as they ought to. I didn’t care for
drinking, only when I was in company, but I was
a little too gay. One night I spent over 12<i>s.</i> in
the St. Helena Gardens at Rotherhithe, and that
sort of thing soon makes money show taper. I
got some work with a rubbish carter, a regular
scurf. I made only about 8<i>s.</i> a week under him,
for he didn’t want me this half day or that whole
day, and if I said anything, he told me I might
go and be <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span>, he could get plenty such, and I
knew he could. I got on then with a gangsman
I knew, at street-sweeping. I had 15<i>s.</i> a week,
but not regular work, but when the work wer’n’t
regular, I had 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a day. I then worked
under another master for 14<i>s.</i> a week, and was
often abused that I wasn’t better dressed, for
though that there master paid low wages, he was
vexed if his men didn’t look decent in the streets.
I’ve heard that he said he paid the best of wages
when asked about it. I had another job after
that, at 15<i>s.</i>, and then 16<i>s.</i> a week, with a contractor
as had a wharf; but a black nigger slave
was never slaved as I was. I’ve worked all night,
when it’s been very moonlight, in loading a barge,
and I’ve worked until three and four in the
morning that way, and then me and another man
slept an hour or two in a shed as joined his
stables, and then must go at it again. Some of
these masters is ignorant, and treats men like dirt,
but this one was always civil, and made his
people be civil. But, Lord, I hadn’t a rag left to
my back. Everything was worn to bits in such
hard work, and then I got the sack. I was on
for Mr. &mdash;&mdash; next. He’s a jolly good ’un. I
was only on for him temp’ry, but I was told it
was for temp’ry when I went, so I can’t complain.
I’m out of work this week, but I’ve had some
jobs from a butcher, and I’m going to work again
on Monday. I don’t know at what wages. The
gangsmen said they’d see what I could do. It’ll
be 15<i>s.</i>, I expect, and over-work if it’s 16<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“Yes, I like a pint of beer now and then, and
one requires it, but I don’t get drunk. I dusted
for a fortnight once while a man was ill, and got
more beer and twopences give me than I do in a
year now; aye, twice as much. My mate and me
was always very civil, and people has said,
‘there’s a good fellow, just sweep together this
bit of rubbish in the yard here, and off with it.’
That was beyond our duty, but we did it. I
have very little night-work, only for one master;
he’s a sweep as well. I get 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a job for it.
Yes, there’s mostly something to drink, but you
can’t demand nothing. Night-work’s nothing, sir;
no more ain’t a knacker’s yard.</p>

<p>“I pay 2<i>s.</i> a week rent, but I’m washed for
and found soap as well. My landlady takes in
washing, and when her husband, for they’re an
old couple, has the rheumatics, I make a trifle by
carrying out the clothes on a barrow, and Mrs.
Smith goes with them and sees to the delivery.

<p>“Well, I don’t know what I spend in my living
in a week. I have a bit of meat, or a saveloy or
two, or a slice of bacon every day, mostly when
I’m at work. I sometimes make my own meals
ready in my room. No, I keep no accounts.
There’d be very little use or pleasure in doing it
when one has so little to count. When I’m past
work, I suppose I must go to the workhouse. I
sometimes wish I’d gone for a soldier when I was
young enough. I shouldn’t have minded going
abroad. I’d have liked it better than not, for <i>I
like to be about; yes, I like a change</i>.</p>

<p>“Things would be well enough with me if I’d
constant work and fair pay. I don’t know what

nothing for poor men’s rights, and poor men’s
sometimes forced to undersell one another, ’cause
half a loaf you know, sir, is better than no bread
at all” (a proverb, by the way, which has wrought
no little mischief).</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may remark, that although I was
told, in the first instance, there was sub-letting in
street sweeping, I could not hear of any facts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
prove it. I was told, indeed, by a gentleman who
took great interest in parochial matters, with a
view to “reforms” in them, that such a thing was
most improbable, for if a contractor sub-let any of
his work it would soon become known, and as it
would be evident that the work could be accomplished
at a lower rate, the contractor would be in
a worse position for his next contract.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Sweeping Machine, and the
Street-Sweepers employed with it.</span></h3>

<p>Until the introduction of the machines now
seen in London, I believe that no mechanical
contrivances for sweeping the streets had been
attempted, all such work being executed by manual
labour, and employing throughout the United
Kingdom a great number of the poor. The street-sweeping
machine, therefore, assumes an importance
as another instance of the displacement, or
attempted displacement, of the labour of man by
the mechanism of an engine.</p>

<p>The street-sweeping machines were introduced
into London about five years ago, after having
been previously used, under the management of a
company, in Manchester, the inventor and maker
being Mr. Whitworth, of that place. The novelty
and ingenuity of the apparatus soon attracted
public attention, and for the first week or two the
vehicular street-sweeper was accompanied in its
progress by a crowd of admiring and inquisitive
pedestrians, so easily attracted together in
the metropolis. In the first instance the machines
were driven through the streets merely to display
their mode and power of work, and the drivers
and attendants not unfrequently came into contact
with the regular scavagers, when a brisk interchange
of street wit took place, the populace
often enough encouraging both sides. At present
the street-sweeping machine proceeds on its line of
operation as little noticed, except by visitors, and
foreigners especially, as any other vehicle. The
body of the sweeping machine, although the sizes
may not all be uniform, is about 5 feet in length,
and 2 feet 8 inches or 3 feet in width; the height is
about 5 feet 6 inches or 6 feet, and the form that of
a covered cart, with a rounded top. The sides of
the exterior are of cast iron, the top being of
wood. At the hinder part of the cart is fixed the
sweeping-machine itself, covered by sloping boards
which descend from the top of the cart, projecting
slightly behind the vehicle to the ground; under
the sloping boards is an endless chain of brushes as
wide as the cart, 16 in number, placed at equal
distances, and so arranged, that when made to
revolve, each brush in turn passes over the ground,
sweeping the mud along with it to the bottom
sloping board, and so carrying it up to the interior
of the cart. The chain of brushes is set in motion,
over the surface of the pavement, by the
agency of three cog wheels of cast iron; these are
worked by the rotation of the wheels of the cart,
the cogs acting upon the spindles to which the
brooms are attached. The spindles, brushes, and
the sloped boards can be raised or lowered by the
winding of an instrument called the broom winder;
or the whole can be locked. The brooms are
raised when any acclivity is to be swept, and
lowered at a declivity. The vehicle must be
water-tight, in order to contain the slop.</p>

<p>When full the machine holds about half a cart
load or half a ton of dirt; this is emptied by
letting down the back in the manner of a trap door.
If the contents be solid, they have to be forked
out; if more sloppy, they are “shot” out, as from
a cart, the interior generally being roughly scraped
to complete the emptying.</p>

<p>The districts which have as yet been cleansed by
the machines are what may be considered a government
domain, being the public thoroughfares under
the control of the Commissioners of the Woods
and Forests, running from Westminster Abbey to
the Regent-circus in Piccadilly, and including
Spring-gardens, Carlton-gardens, and a portion of
the West Strand, where they were first employed
in London; they have been used also in parts of
the City; and are at present employed by the
parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The company
by whom the mechanical street-sweeping business
is carried on employ 12 machines, 4 water carts,
19 horses, and 24 men. They have also the use,
but not the sole use, of two wharfs and barges
at Whitefriars and Millbank. The machines
altogether collect about 30 cart-loads of street-dirt
a day, which is equivalent to four or five barge-loads
in a week, if all were boated. Two barges
per week are usually sent to Rochester, the others
up the river to Fulham, &amp;c. The average price is
5<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to 6<i>l.</i> per barge load, but when the freight
has been chiefly dung, as much as 8<i>l.</i> has been
paid for it by a farmer.</p>

<p>The street-sweeping machine seems to have
commanded the approbation of the General Board
of Health, although the Board’s expression of approval
is not without qualification. “Even that efficient
and economical implement,” says one of the
Reports, “the street-sweeping machine, leaves
much filth between the interstices of the stones
and some on the surface.” One might have imagined,
however, that an efficient and economical
implement would not have left this “much filth”
in its course; but the Board, I presume, spoke
comparatively.</p>

<p>The reason of the circumscribed adoption of
the machine&mdash;I say it with some reluctance, but
from concurrent testimony&mdash;appears to be that it
does <i>not</i> sweep sufficiently clean. It sweeps the
surface, but only the surface; not cleansing what
the scavagers call the “nicks” and “holes,”
and the Board of Health the “interstices,” in
the pavement.</p>

<p>One man is obliged to go along with each machine,
to sweep the ridge of dirt invariably left at
the edge of the track of the vehicle into the line
of the next machine, so that it may be “licked up.”
In fine weather this work is often light enough. It
is also the occupation of the accompanying scavager
to sweep the dirt from the sloping edges of the public
ways into the direct course of the machine, for the
brushes are of no service along such slopes; he must
also sweep out the contents of any hole or hollow
there may be in the streets, as is frequently the
case when the pavement has been disturbed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
relaying or repairing of the gas or water pipes.
But for this arrangement, I was told, the brushes
would pass “clean over” such places, or only disturb
without clearing away the dirt. Indeed
irregularities of any kind in the pavement are
great obstructions to the efficiency of the street-sweeping
machine.</p>

<p>There are some places, moreover, wholly unsweepable
by the machine; in many parts of St.
Martin’s parish, for instance, there are localities
where the machine cannot be introduced; such
are&mdash;St. Martin’s-court; the flagged ways about
the National Gallery; and the approach, alongside
the church, to the Lowther Arcade; the pavement
surrounding the fountains which adorn the
“noblest site in Europe;” and a variety of
alleys, passages, yards, and minor streets, which
must be cleansed by manual labour.</p>

<p>In fair weather, again, water carts are indispensable
before machine sweeping, for if the ground
be merely dry and dusty, the set of brooms will
not “bite.”</p>

<p>We now come to estimate the <i>relative values of
the mechanical and manual labour applied to the
scavaging of the streets</i>. The average progress of
the street-sweeping machine, in the execution of
the scavagers’ work, is about two miles an hour. It
must not be supposed, however, that two streets
each a mile in length, could be swept in one hour;
for to do this the vehicle would have to travel up and
down those streets as many times as the streets
are wider than the machine. The machines,
sometimes two, sometimes three or four, follow
alongside each other’s tracks in sweeping a street,
so as to leave no part unswept. Thus, supposing
a street half a mile long and nine yards wide, and
that each machine swept a breadth of a yard,
then three such machines, driven once up, and
once again down, and once more up such a street,
would cleanse it in three quarters of an hour. To
do this by manual labour in the same or nearly
the same time, would require the exertions of five
men. Each machine has been computed to have
mechanical power equal to the industry of five
street-sweepers; and such, from the above computation,
would appear to be the fact. I do not include
the drivers in this enumeration, as of course the
horse in the scavagers’ cart, and in the machine
require alike the care of a man, and there is to
each vehicle (whether mechanical or not) one hand
(besides the carman) to sweep after the ordinary
work. Hence every two men with the machine do
the work of seven men by hand.</p>

<p>Having, then, ascertained the relative values
of the two forces employed in cleansing the
streets, let me now proceed to set forth what is
“the economy of labour” resulting from the use
of the sweeping machine. In the following table
are given the number of men at present engaged
by the machine company in the cleansing of those
districts where the machine is in operation, as well
as the annual amount of wages paid to the machine
labourers; these facts are then collocated
with the number of manual labourers that would
be required to do the same work under the
ordinary contract system (assuming every two
labourers with the machine to do the work of
seven labourers by hand), as well as the amount of
wages that would be paid to such manual labourers;
and finally, the number of men and amount of
wages under the one system of street-cleansing is
subtracted from the other, in order to arrive at
the number of street-sweepers at present displaced
by machine labour, and the annual loss in wages
to the men so displaced; or, to speak economically,
the last column represents the amount by which
the Wage Fund of the street-sweepers is diminished
by the employment of the machine.</p>

<p>Hence, we perceive that no less than 60 street-sweepers
are deprived of work by the street-sweeping
machine, and that the gross Wage Fund of the
men is diminished by the employment of mechanical
labour no less than 2277<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>But let us suppose the street-sweeping machine
to come into general use, and all the men who are
at present employed by the contractors, both large
and small, to sweep the street by hand to be superseded
by it, what would be the result? how much
money would the manual labourers be deprived of
per annum, and how many self-supporting labourers
would be pauperized thereby? The following

<p>Here we find that nearly 200 men would be
pauperized, losing upwards of 7000<i>l.</i> per annum,
if the street-sweeping machine came into general
use throughout London. But, before the introduction
of machines, the thoroughfares of St.
Martin’s parish were swept only once a week in
dry weather, and three times a week in sloppy
weather, and since the introduction of the machines
they have been swept daily; allowing, therefore,
the extra cleansing to have arisen from the extra
cheapness of the machine work&mdash;though it seems
to have been the result of improved sanatory regulations,
for in parts where the machine has not
been used the same alteration has taken place&mdash;making
such allowance, however, it may, perhaps,
be fair to say, that the same increase of
cleansing would take place throughout London;
that is to say, that the streets would be swept by
the machines, were they generally used, twice as
often as they are at present by hand. At this
rate 158 machine men, instead of 79 as above
calculated, would be required for the work; so
that, reckoning for the increased employment which
might arise from the increased cheapness of the
work, we see that, were the street-sweeping machines
used throughout the metropolis, nearly 120
of the 275 manual labourers now employed at
scavaging by the large and small contractors,
would be thrown out of work, and deprived of no
less a sum than 4680<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>This amount, of course, the parishes would pocket,
minus the sum that it would cost them to keep the
displaced scavagers as paupers, so that in this
instance, at least, we perceive that, however great a
benefit cheapness may be to the wealthy classes, to
the poorer classes it is far from being of the same
advantageous character; for, just as much as the
rate-payers are the gainers in the matter of street-cleansing
must the labourers be the losers&mdash;the
economy of labour in a trade where there are too
many labourers already, and where the quantity of
work does not admit of indefinite increase, meaning
simply the increase of pauperism<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The “<i>labour question</i>” as connected with the
sweeping-machine work, requires but a brief detail,
as it presents no new features. The majority
of the machine men may be described as having
been “general (unskilled) labourers” before they
embarked in their present pursuits: labourers for
builders, brick-makers, rubbish-carters, the docks,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Among them there is but one who was brought
up as a mechanic; the others have all been labourers,
brick-makers, and what I heard called
“barrow-workers” on railways, the latter being
the most numerous.</p>

<p>Employment is obtained by application at the
wharfs. There is nothing of the character of
a trade society among the machine-men; nothing
in the way of benefit or sick clubs, unless the men
choose to enrol themselves in a general benefit
society, of which I did not hear one instance.</p>

<p>The payment is by the week, and without
drawback in the guise or disguise of fines, or
similar inflictions for the use of tools, &amp;c.; the
payment, moreover, is always in money.</p>

<p>The only perquisite is in the case of anything
being found in the streets; but the rule as to
perquisites seems to be altogether an understanding
among the men. The disposal of what may
be picked up in the streets appears, moreover, to
be very much in the discretion of the picker up.
If anything be found in the contents of the
vehicle, when emptied, it is the perquisite of the
driver, who is also the unloader; he, however,
is expected to treat the men “on the same beat”
out of any such “treasure trove,” when the said
treasure is considerable enough to justify such
bounty. Odd sixpences, shillings, or copper coin,
I was informed, were found almost every week,
but I could ascertain no general average. One
man, some time ago, found a purse inside the vehicle
containing 20<i>s.</i>, and “spent it out and out all
on hisself,” in a carouse of three days. He lost his
situation in consequence.</p>

<p>The number of men employed by the company
in this trade is 24, and these perform all the work
required in the driving and attendance upon the
machines in the street, in loading the barges,
grooming the horses, &amp;c. There is, indeed, a
twenty-fifth man, but he is a blacksmith, and his
wages of 35<i>s.</i> weekly are included in the estimate
as to wear and tear given below, for he shoes the
horses and repairs the machines.</p>

<p>The rate of wages paid by the machine company
is 16<i>s.</i> a week, so that the full amount of
wages is paid to the men.</p>

<p>But though the company cannot be ranked
among the grinders of the scavaging trade, they
<i>must</i> be placed among “the drivers.”</p>

<p>I am assured, by those who are familiar with
such labour, that the 24 men employed by the machine
masters do the work of upwards of 30 in the
honourable trade, with a corresponding saving to
their employers, from an adherence to the main
point of the scurf system, the overworking of the
men without extra payment.</p>

<p>It has been before stated that, in dry weather,
the roads require to be watered before being
swept, so that the brushes may <i>bite</i>. In summer
the machine-men sometimes commence this part
of their business at three in the morning; and
at the other periods of the year, sometimes at early
morning, when moonlight. In summer the hours
of labour in the streets are from three, four, five,
or six in the morning, to half-past four in the afternoon;
in winter, from light to light, and after
street there may be yard and barge work.</p>

<p>The saving by this scurf system, then, <span class="lock">is:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It now but remains to sum up the capital,
income, and expenditure of the machine-scavaging
trade.</p>

<p>The cost of a street-sweeping machine is 50<i>l.</i>
to 60<i>l.</i>, with an additional 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for the set of
brooms. The wear and tear of these machines
are very considerable. A man who had the
care of one told me that when there was a
heavy stress on it he had known the iron
cogs of the inner wheels “go rattle, rattle,
snap, snap,” until it became difficult to proceed
with the work. The brooms, too, in hard
work and “cloggy” weather, are apt to snap
short, and in the regular course of wear
have to be renewed every four or five weeks.
The sets of brooms are of bass, worked strongly
with copper wire. The whole apparatus can be
unscrewed and taken to pieces, to be cleaned or
repaired. The repairs, independently of the
renewal of the brooms, have been calculated at
7<i>l.</i> yearly each machine. The capital invested,
then, in twelve street-sweeping machines, in the
horses, and what may be considered the appurtenances
of the trade, together with the yearly
expenditure, may be thus <span class="lock">calculated:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cleansing of the Streets by Pauper
Labour.</span></h3>

<p>Under the head of the several modes and characteristics
of street-cleansing, I stated at p. <a href="#Page_207">207</a>
of the present volume that there were no less
than four distinct kinds of labourers employed in
the scavaging of the public thoroughfares of the
metropolis. These <span class="lock">were:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
1. The self-supporting manual labourers.<br />
2. The self-supporting machine labourers.<br />
3. The pauper labourers.<br />
4. The “philanthropic” labourers.<br />
</p>

<p>I have already set forth the distinguishing
features of the first two of these different orders
of workmen in connection with the scavaging
trade, and now proceed in due order to treat of
the characteristics of the third.</p>

<p>The subject of pauper labour generally is one
of the most difficult topics that the social philosopher
can deal with. It is not possible, however,
to do more here than draw attention to the salient
points of the question. The more comprehensive
consideration of the matter must be reserved till
such time as I come to treat of the poor specially
under the head of those that cannot work.</p>

<p>By the 43 Eliz., which is generally regarded as
the basis of the existing poor laws in this country,
it was ordained that in every parish a fund should
be raised by local taxation, not merely for the
relief of the aged and infirm, but <i>for setting to
work all persons having no means to maintain
themselves, and using no ordinary or daily trade
of life to get their living by</i>.</p>

<p>It was, however, soon discovered that it was
one thing to pass an act for setting able-bodied
paupers to work, and another thing to do so.
“In every place,” as Mr. Thornton truly says in
his excellent treatise on “Over Population,” “there
is only a certain amount of work to be done,”
(limited by the extent of the market) “and only
a certain amount of capital to pay for it; and, if
the number of workmen be more than proportionate
to the work, employment can only be
given to those who want it by taking from those
who have.”</p>

<p>Let me illustrate this by the circumstances of
the scavaging trade. There are 1760 miles of
streets throughout London, and these would seem
to require about 600 scavagers to cleanse them. It
is self-evident, therefore, that if 400 paupers be
“set” to sweep particular districts, the same number
of self-supporting labourers must be deprived
of employment, and if these cannot obtain work
elsewhere, they of course must become paupers too,
and, seeking relief, be put upon the same kind
of work as they were originally deprived of, and
that only to displace and pauperize in their turn a
similar number of independent operatives.</p>

<p>The work of a country then being limited (by
the capital and market for the produce), there can
be but two modes of setting paupers to labour: (1)
by throwing the self-supporting operatives out of
employment altogether, and substituting pauper
labourers in their stead; (2) by giving a portion of
the work to the paupers, and so decreasing the
employment, and consequently the wages, of the
regular operatives. In either case, however, the
independent labourers must be reduced to a state
of comparative or positive dependence, for <i>it is
impossible to make labourers of the paupers of an
over-populated country without making paupers
of the labourers</i>.</p>

<p>Some economists argue that, as paupers are consumers,
they should, whenever they are able to
work, be made producers also, or otherwise they
exhaust the national wealth, to which they do not
contribute. This might be a sound axiom were
there work sufficient for all. But in an over-populated
country there is not work enough, as is
proven by the mere fact of the over-population;
and the able-bodied paupers <i>are</i> paupers simply
<i>because they cannot obtain work</i>, so that to employ
those who are out of work is to throw out those who
are in work, and thus to pauperize the self-supporting.</p>

<p>The whole matter seems to hinge upon this
one <span class="lock">question&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Who are to maintain the paupers? The ratepaying
traders or the non-ratepaying workmen?</p>

<p>If the paupers be set to work in a country like
Great Britain, they must necessarily be brought
into competition with the self-supporting workmen,
and so be made to share the wage fund with them,
decreasing the price of labour in proportion to the
extra number of such pauper labourers among whom
the capital of the trade has to be shared. Hence
the burden of maintaining the paupers will be
virtually shifted from the capitalist to the labourer,
the poor-rate being thus really paid out of the
wages of the operatives, instead of the profits of
the traders, as it should be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>And here lies the great wrong of pauper labour.
It saddles the poor with the maintenance of their
poorer brethren, while the rich not only contribute
nothing to their support, but are made still richer
by the increased cheapness resulting from the depreciation
of labour and their consequent ability
to obtain a greater quantity of commodities for
the same amount of money.</p>

<p>In illustration of this argument let us say the
wages of 600 independent scavagers amount, at
15<i>s.</i> a week each the year through, to 23,400<i>l.</i> per
annum; and let us say, moreover, that the keep
of 400 paupers amounts, at 5<i>s.</i> a week each, to,
altogether, 5200<i>l.</i>; hence the total annual expense
to the several metropolitan parishes for cleansing
the streets and maintaining 400 paupers would
be 23,400<i>l.</i> + 5200<i>l.</i> = 28,600<i>l.</i></p>

<p>If, however, the 400 paupers be set to scavaging
work, and made to do something for their
keep, one of two things <i>must</i> follow: (1) either
the 400 extra hands will receive their share
of the 23,400<i>l.</i> devoted to the payment of the
operative scavagers, in which case the wages of
each of the regular hands will be reduced from
15<i>s.</i> to 9<i>s.</i> a week; hence the maintenance
of the paupers will be saddled upon the 600
independent operatives, who will lose no less
than 9360<i>l.</i> per annum, while the ratepayers will
be saved the maintenance of the 400 paupers
and so gain 5200<i>l.</i> per annum by the change;
(2) or else 400 of the self-supporting operatives
must be thrown out of work, in which case the
displaced labourers will lose no less than 15,600<i>l.</i>,
while the ratepayers will gain upwards of 5000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The reader is now, I believe, in a position to
comprehend the wrong done to the self-supporting
scavagers by the employment of pauper labour in
the cleansing of the streets.</p>

<p>The preparation of the material of the roads of
a parish seems, as far as the metropolis is concerned,
at one time to have supplied the chief
“test,” to which parishes have resorted, as regards
the willingness to labour on the part of the able-bodied
applicants for relief. When the casual
wards of the workhouses were open for the reception
of all vagrants who sought a night’s
shelter, each tramper was required to break so
many stones in the morning before receiving a
certain allowance of bread, soup, or what not for
his breakfast; and he then might be received again
into the shelter of this casual asylum. In some
parishes the wards were open without the test of
stone-breaking, and there was a crowded resort to
them, especially during the prevalence of the
famine in Ireland and the immigration of the Irish
peasants to England. The favourite resort of the
vagrants was Marylebone workhouse, and Irish
immigrants very frequently presented slips of
paper on which some tramper whom they had
met with on their way had written “<i>Marylebone
workhouse</i>,” as the best place at which they could
apply, and these the simple Irish offered as passports
for admission!</p>

<p>Gradually, the asylum of these wards, with or
without labour tests, was discontinued, and in one
where the labour test used to be strongly insisted
upon&mdash;in St. Pancras&mdash;a school for pauper children
has been erected on the site of the stone-yard.</p>

<p>This labour test was unequal when applied to
all comers; for what was easy work to an agricultural
labourer, a railway excavator, a quarryman,
or to any one used to wield a hammer, was painful
and blistering to a starving tailor. Nor was the
test enforced by the overseers or regarded by the
paupers as a proof of willingness to work, but
simply as a punishment for poverty, and as a
means of deterring the needy from applying for
relief. To make labour a punishment, however, is
<i>not</i> to destroy, but really to confirm, idle habits;
it is to give a deeper root to the vagrant’s settled
aversion to work. “Well, I always thought it was
unpleasant,” the vagabond will say to himself
“<i>that</i> working for one’s bread, and now I’m <i>convinced</i>
of it!” Again, in many of the workhouses
the labour to which the paupers were set was of a
manifestly unremunerative character, being work
for mere work’s sake; and to apply people to unproductive
labour is to destroy all the ordinary
motives to toil&mdash;to take away the only stimulus to
industry, and remove the very will to work which
the labour test was supposed to discover<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>The labour test, then, or setting the poor to
work as a proof of their willingness to labour,
appears to be as foolish as it is vicious; the objections
to it being&mdash;(1) the inequality of the test
applied to different kinds of work-people; (2) the
tendency of it to confirm rather than weaken idle
habits by making labour inordinately repulsive;
(3) the removal of the ordinary stimulus to industry
by the unproductiveness of the work to
which the poor are generally applied.</p>

<p>And now, having dealt with the subject of parish
labour as a test of the willingness to work on the
part of the applicants for relief, I will proceed to
deal with that portion of the work itself which is
connected with the cleansing of the streets.</p>

<p>And first as to the employment of paupers at
all in the streets. If pauperism be a disgrace,
then it is unjust to turn a man into the
public thoroughfares, wearing the badge of beggary,
to be pointed at and scorned for his poverty,
especially when we are growing so particularly
studious of our criminals that we make them
wear masks to prevent even their faces being
seen<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. Nor is it consistent with the principles of
an enlightened national morality that we should
force a body of honest men to labour upon the
highways, branded with a degrading garb, like
convicts. Neither is it <i>wise</i> to do so, for the
shame of poverty soon becomes deadened by the
repeated exposure to public scorn; and thus the
occasional recipient of parish relief is ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
converted into the hardened and habitual pauper.
“Once a pauper always a pauper,” I was assured
was the parish rule; and here lies the <i>rationale</i> of
the fact. Not long ago this system of employing
<i>badged</i> paupers to labour in the public thoroughfares
was carried to a much more offensive extent than it
is even at present. At one time the pauper
labourers of a certain parish had the attention
of every passer-by attracted to them while at
their work, for on the back of each man’s garb&mdash;a
sort of smock-frock&mdash;was marked, with sufficient
prominence, “<span class="smcap">Clerkenwell. Stop it!</span>” This
public intimation that the labourers were not only
paupers, but regarded as thieves, and expected to
purloin the parish dress they wore, attracted public
attention, and was severely commented upon at a
meeting. The “<span class="smcap">Stop it!</span>” therefore was cancelled,
and the frocks are now <i>merely</i> lettered
“<span class="smcap">Clerkenwell</span>.” Before the alteration the men
very generally wore the garment inside out.</p>

<p>The present dress of the parish scavagers is
usually a loose smock-frock, costing 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
2<i>s.</i>, and a glazed hat of about the same price. In
some cases, however, the men may wear these
things or not, at their option.</p>

<p>The pauper scavagers employed by the several
metropolitan parishes may be divided into three
<span class="lock">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The in-door paupers, who receive no wages
whatever (their lodging, food, and clothing being
considered to be sufficient remuneration for their
labour).</p>

<p>2. The out-door paupers, who are paid partly in
money and partly in kind, and employed in some
cases three days and in others six days in the
week.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These may be subdivided into&mdash;(<i>a</i>) the single
men, who receive, or rather used to receive,
9<i>d.</i> and a quartern loaf for each of the three
or more days they were so employed; (<i>b</i>) the
married men with families, who receive 7<i>s.</i>
and 3 quartern loaves a week to 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> and
1 quartern loaf for each day’s labour.</p></div>

<p>3. The unemployed labourers of the district,
who are set to scavaging work by the parish,
and paid a regular money wage&mdash;the employment
being constant, and the rate of remuneration
ranging from 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day for each of
the six days, or from 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p>In pp. <a href="#Page_248">246, 247</a>, I give a table of the wages paid
by each of the metropolitan parishes. This has been
collected at great trouble in order to arrive at the
truth on this most important matter, and for which
purpose the several parishes have been personally
visited. It will be seen on reference to this
document, that there is only one parish at present
that employs its in-door paupers in the scavaging of
the public streets; and 3 parishes employing 48
out-door paupers, who are paid partly in money
and partly in bread; the money remuneration
ranging from 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a day (paid by Clerkenwell)
to 7<i>s.</i> a week (paid by Chelsea), and moreover 31
parishes employing 408 applicants for relief (paupers
they cannot be called), and paying them wholly
in money, the remuneration ranging from 15<i>s.</i>
per week to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (paid by the Liberty of
the Rolls), and the employment from 6 to 3
days weekly. As a general rule it was found
that the greatest complaints were made by
the authorities as to the idleness of the poor,
and by the poor as to the tyranny of the
authorities, in those parishes where the remuneration
was the least. In St. Luke’s, Chelsea, for
instance, where the remuneration is but 7<i>s.</i> a week
and three loaves, the criminations and recriminations
by the parish functionaries and the paupers
were almost equally harsh and bitter. I should,
however, observe that the men employed in this
parish spoke in terms of great commendation of
Mr. Pattison the surveyor, saying he always gave
them to understand that they were free labourers,
and invariably treated them as such. The men
at work for Bermondsey parish also spoke very
highly of their superintendent, who, it seems, has
interested himself to obtain for them a foul-weather
coat. Some of the highway boards or trusts take
all the pauper labourers sent them by the parish,
while others give employment only to such as
please them. These boards generally pay good
wages, and are in favour with the men.</p>

<p>The mode of working, as regards the use of the
implements and the manual labour, is generally
the same among the pauper scavagers as I have
described in connection with the scavagers generally.</p>

<p>The consideration of what is the rate of parish
pay to the poor who are employed as scavagers,
is complicated by the different modes in which
the employment is carried out, for, as we see,
there is&mdash;1st, the scavaging labour, by workhouse
inmates, without any payment beyond
the cost of maintenance and clothing; 2nd, the
“short” or three-days-a-week labour, with or
without “relief” in the bestowal of bread; and
3rd, the six days’ work weekly, with a money
wage and no bread, nor anything in the form of
payment in kind or of “relief.”</p>

<p>Let me begin with the first system of labour
above mentioned, viz. the employment of the in-door
paupers without wages of any kind, their
food, lodging, and clothing being considered as
equivalents for their work. The principal evil in
connection with this form of parish work is its
compulsory character, the men regarding it not as
so much work given in exchange for such and
such comforts, but as something <i>exacted</i> from
them; and, to tell the truth, it is precisely the
counterpart of slavery, being equally deficient in
all inducement to toil, and consequently requiring
almost the same system of compulsion and supervision
in order to keep the men at their labour.
All interest in the work is destroyed, there being
no reward connected with it; and consequently
the same organized system of setting to work is
required as with cattle. There are but two inducements
to voluntary action&mdash;pain to be avoided
or pleasure to be derived&mdash;or, in other words, the
attractiveness and repulsiveness of objects. Take
away the pecuniary attraction of labour, and men
become mere beasts of burden, capable of being
set to work only by the dread of some punishment;
hence the system of parish labour, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
has no reward directly connected with it, must
necessarily be tyrannical, and so tend to induce
idleness and a hatred of work altogether.</p>

<p>Of the different forms of pauper work, street-sweeping
is, I am inclined to believe, the most
unpopular of all among the poor. The scavaging
is generally done in the workhouse dress, and
that to all, except the hardened paupers, and
sometimes even to them, is highly distasteful.
Neither have such labourers, as I have said, the
incentive of that hope of the reward which,
however diminutive, still tends to sweeten the
most repulsive labour. I am informed by an experienced
gangsman under a contractor, that it is
notorious that the workhouse hands are the least
industrious scavagers in the streets. “They don’t
sweep as well,” he said, “and don’t go about it
like regular men; they take it quite easy.” It is
often asserted that this labour of the workhouse
men is applied as a <i>test</i>; but this opinion seems
rather to bear on the past than the present.</p>

<p>One man thus employed gave me the following
account. He was garrulous but not communicative,
as is frequently the case with men who
love to hear themselves talk, and are not very
often able to command listeners. He was healthy
looking enough, but he told me he was, or had
been “delicate.” He querulously objected to be
questioned about his youth, or the reason of his
being a pauper, but seemed to be abounding in
workhouse stories and workhouse grievances.</p>

<p>“Street-sweeping,” he said, “degrades a man,
and if a man’s poor he hasn’t no call to be degraded.
Why can’t they set the thieves and pickpockets
to sweep? they could be watched easy
enough; there’s always idle fellers as reckons theirselves
real gents, as can be got for watching and
sitch easy jobs, for they gets as much for them, as
three men’s paid for hard work in a week. I never
was in a prison, but I’ve heerd that people there is
better fed and better cared for than in workusses.
What’s the meaning of that, sir, I’d like for to
know? You can’t tell me, but I can tell you.
The workus is made as ugly as it can be, that poor
people may be got to leave it, and chance dying
in the street rather.” [Here the man indulged
in a gabbled detail of a series of pauper grievances
which I had a difficulty in diverting or interrupting.
On my asking if the other paupers had
the same opinion as to street-sweeping as he had,
he replied:&mdash;] “To be sure they has; all them that
has sense to have a ’pinion at all has; there’s not
two sides to it any how. No, I don’t want to be
kept and do nothink. I want <i>proper</i> work. And
by the rights of it I might as well be kept with
nothink to do as &mdash;&mdash; or &mdash;&mdash;” [parish officials].
“Have they nothing to do,” I asked? “Nothink,
but to make mischief and get what ought to go to
the poor. It’s salaries and such like as swallers
the rates, and that’s what every poor family
knows as knows anythink. Did I ever like my
work better? Certainly not. Do I take any
pains with it? Well, where would be the good?
I can sweep well enough, when I please, but if I
could do more than the best man as ever Mr.
Darke paid a pound a week to, it wouldn’t be a
bit better for me&mdash;not a bit, sir, I assure you. We
all takes it easy whenever we can, but the work
<i>must</i> be done. The only good about it is that
you get outside the house. It’s a change that
way certainly. But we work like horses and is
treated like asses.” [On my reminding him that
he had just told me that they all took it easy
when they could, and <i>that</i> rather often, he replied:]
“Well, don’t horses? But it ain’t much
use talking, sir. It’s only them as has been in
workusses and in parish work as can understand
all the ins and outs of it.”</p>

<p>In giving the above and the following statements
I have endeavoured to elicit the <i>feelings</i> of
the several paupers whom I conversed with.
Poor, ignorant, or prejudiced men may easily be
mistaken in their opinions, or in what they may
consider their “facts,” but if a clear exposition of
their sentiments be obtained, it is a guide to the
truth. I have, therefore, given the statement of the
in-door pauper’s opinions, querulously as they were
delivered, as I believe them to be the sentiments
of those of his class who, as he said, had any
opinion at all.</p>

<p>It seems indeed, from all I could learn on the
subject, that pauper street-work, even at the best,
is unwilling and slovenly work, pauper workmen
being the worst of all workmen. If the streets be
swept clean, it is because a dozen paupers are put
to the labour of eight, nine, or ten regular scavagers
who are independent labourers, and who may have
some “pride of art,” or some desire to show their
employers that they are to be depended upon.
This feeling does not actuate the pauper workman,
who thinks or knows that if he did evince a
desire and a perseverance to please, it would avail
him little beyond the sneers and ill-will of his
mates; so that, even with a disposition to acquire
the good opinion of the authorities, there is this
obstacle in his way, and to most men who move in
a circumscribed sphere it is a serious obstacle.</p>

<p>Of the second mode of pauper scavaging, viz.,
that performed by out-door paupers, and paid
for partly in money and partly in kind, I heard
from officials connected with pauper management
very strong condemnations, as being full of mischievous
and degrading tendencies. The payment
to the out-door pauper scavager averages, as I
have stated, 9<i>d.</i> a day to a single man, with,
perhaps, a quartern loaf; and this, in some cases,
is for only three days in the week; while to a married
man with a family, it varies between 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>
and 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a day, with a quartern, and sometimes
two quartern loaves; and this, likewise, is occasionally
from three to six days in the week. On
this the single or family men must subsist, if they
have no other means of earning an addition. The
men thus employed are certainly not independent
labourers, nor are they, in the full sense of the
word as popularly understood, paupers; for their
means of subsistence are partly the fruits of their
toil; and although they are wretchedly dependent,
they seem to feel that they have a sort of right to
be set to work, as the law ordains such modicum
of relief, in or out of the workhouse, as will only
ward off death through hunger. This “three-days-a-week
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
work” is by the poor or pauper

<p>From a married man employed by the parish
under this mode, I had the following account.</p>

<p>He was an intelligent-looking man, of about 35,
but with nothing very particular in his appearance
unless it were a head of very curly hair. He
gave me the statement in his own room, which
was larger than I have usually found such
abodes, and would have been very bare, but that
it was somewhat littered with the vessels of his
trade as a street-seller of Nectar, Persian Sherbet,
Raspberryade, and other decoctions of coloured
ginger-beer, with high-sounding names and indifferent
flavour: in the summer he said he could
live better thereby, with a little costering, than by
street-sweeping, but being often a sickly man he
could not do so during the uncertainties of a winter
street trade. His wife, a decent looking woman,
was present occasionally, suckling one child, about
two years old&mdash;for the poor often protract the weaning
of their children, as the mother’s nutriment is
the <i>cheapest</i> of all food for the infant, and as the
means of postponing the further increase of their
family&mdash;whilst another of five or six years of age sat
on a bench by her side. There was nothing on the
walls in the way of an ornament, as I have seen
in some of the rooms of the poor, for the couple
had once been in the workhouse, and might be
driven there again, and with such apprehensions
did not care, perhaps, to make a home otherwise
than they found it, even if the consumption of
only a little spare time were involved.</p>

<p>The husband <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was brought up as a type-founder; my
father, who was one, learnt me his trade; but he
died when I was quite a young man, or I might
have been better perfected in it. I was comfortably
off enough then, and got married. Very
soon after that I was taken ill with an abscess in
my neck, you can see the mark of it still.” [He
showed me the mark.] “For six months I wasn’t
able to do a thing, and I was a part of the time,
I don’t recollect how long, in St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital. I was weak and ill when I came
out, and hardly fit for work; I couldn’t hear of
any work I could get, for there was a great
bother in the trade between master and men.
Before I went into the hospital, there was money
to pay to doctors; and when I came out I could
earn nothing, so everything went, yes, sir, everything.
My wife made a little matter with charing
for families she’d lived in, but things are in a bad
way if a poor woman has to keep her husband.
She was taken ill at last, and then there was
nothing but the parish for us. I suffered a great
deal before it come to that. It was awful. No
one can know what it is but them that suffers it.
But I didn’t know what in the world to do. We
lived then in St. Luke’s, and were passed to our
own parish, and were three months in the workhouse.
The living was good enough, better then
than it is now, I’ve heard, but I was miserable.”
[“And I was <i>very</i> miserable,” interposed the wife,
“for I had been brought up comfortable; my
father was a respectable tradesman in St. George’s-in-the-East,
and I had been in good situations.”]
“We made ourselves,” said the husband, “as
useful as we could, but we were parted of course.
At the three months’ end, I had 10<i>s.</i> given to me
to come out with, and was told I might start
costermongering on it. But to a man not up to
the trade, 10<i>s.</i> won’t go very far to keep up
costering. I didn’t feel master enough of my
own trade by this time to try for work at it, and
work wasn’t at all regular. There were good
hands earning only 12<i>s.</i> a week. The 10<i>s.</i> soon
went, and I had again to apply for relief, and got
an order for the stone-yard to go and break stones.
Ten bushels was to be broken for 15<i>d.</i> It was
dreadful hard work at first. My hands got all
blistered and bloody, and I’ve gone home and
cried with pain and wretchedness. At first it was
on to three days before I could break the ten
bushels. I felt shivered to bits all over my arms
and shoulders, and my head was splitting. I then
got to do it in two days, and then in one, and it
grew easier. But all this time I had only what
was reckoned three days’ work in a week. That
is, you see, sir, I had only three times ten bushels
of stones given to break in the week, and earned
only 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> Yes, I lived on it, and paid 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week rent, for the neighbours took care of a
few sticks for us, and the parish or a broker
wouldn’t have found them worth carriage. My
wife was then in the country with a sister. I
lived upon bread and dripping, went without fire
or candle (or had one only very seldom) though
it wasn’t warm weather. I can safely say that
for eight weeks I never tasted one bite of meat,
and hardly a bite of butter. When I couldn’t
sleep of a night, but that wasn’t often, it was
terrible, very. I washed what bits of things I
had then myself, and had sometimes to get a
ha’porth of soap as a favour, as the chandler said
she ‘didn’t make less than a penn’orth.’ If I
eat too much dripping, it made me feel sick. I
hardly know how much bread and dripping I eat
in a week. I spent what money I had in it and
bread, and sometimes went without. I was very
weak, you may be sure, sir; and if I’d had the
influenza or anything that way, I should have
gone off like a shot, for I seemed to have no constitution
left. But my wife came back again and
got work at charing, and made about 4<i>s.</i> a week
at it; but we were still very badly off. Then I
got to work on the roads every day, and had 1<i>s.</i>
and a quartern loaf a day, which was a rise. I
had only one child then, but men with larger
families got two quartern loaves a day. Single
men got 9<i>d.</i> a day. It was far easier work than
stone-breaking too. The hours were from eight
to five in winter, and from seven to six in summer.
But there’s always changes going on, and we were
put on 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a day and a quartern loaf, and
only three days a week. All the same as to time
of course. The bread wasn’t good; it was only
cheap. I suppose there was 20 of us working most
of the times as I was. The gangsman, as you
call him, but that’s more for the regular hands,
was a servant of the parish, and a great tyrant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Yes, indeed, when we had a talk among ourselves,
there was nothing but grumbling heard of.
Some of the tales I’ve heard were shocking;
worse than what I’ve gone through. Everybody
was grumbling, except perhaps two men that had
been 20 years in the streets, and were like born
paupers. They didn’t feel it, for there’s a great
difference in men. They knew no better. But
anybody might have been frightened to hear some
of the men talk and curse. We’ve stopped work
to abuse the parish officers as might be passing.
We’ve mobbed the overseers, and a number of us,
I was one, were taken before the magistrate for
it; but we told him how badly we were off, and
he discharged us, and gave us orders into the
workhouse, and told ’em to see if nothing could be
done for us. We were there till next morning, and
then sent away without anything being said.</p>

<p>“It’s a sad life, sir, is a parish worker’s. I
wish to God I could get out of it. But when a
man has children he can’t stop and say ‘I can’t
do this,’ and ‘I won’t do that.’ Last week, now,
in costering, I lost 6<i>s.</i>” [he meant that his expenses,
of every kind, exceeded his receipts by 6<i>s.</i>],
“and though I can distil nectar, or anything that way”
[this was said somewhat laughingly], “it’s only
when the weather’s hot and fine that any good
at all can be done with it. I think, too, that
there’s not the money among working men that
there once was. Anything regular in the way of
pay must always be looked at by a man with a
family.</p>

<p>“Of course the streets must be properly swept,
and if I can sweep them as well as Mr. Dodd’s
men, for I know one of them very well, why
should I have only 3<i>s.</i> 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> a week and three
loaves, and he have 16<i>s.</i>, I think it is? I don’t
drink, my wife knows I don’t” [the wife assented],
“and it seems as if in a parish a man must be kept
down when he is down, and then blamed for it.
I may not understand all about it, but it looks
queer.”</p>

<p>From an <i>unmarried</i> man, looking like a mere
boy in the face, although he assured me he was
nearly 24, as far as he knew, I heard an account
of his labour and its fruits as a parish scavager;
also of his former career, which partakes greatly
in its characteristics of the narratives I gave, toward
the close of the first volume, of deserted,
neglected, and runaway children.</p>

<p>He lived from his earliest recollection with an
old woman whom he first called “grandmother,”
and was then bid to call “aunt,” and she, some of
the neighbours told him, had “kept him out of
his rights,” for she had 4<i>s.</i> a week with him, so
that there ought to have been money coming to
him when he grew up. I have sometimes heard
similar statements from the ignorant poor, for it is
agreeable enough to them to fancy that they have
been wronged out of fortunes to which they were
justly entitled, and deprived of the position and
consequence in life which they ought to have possessed
“by rights.” In the course of my inquiries
among the poor women who supply the slop
milliners’ shops with widows’ caps, cap fronts,
women’s collars, &amp;c., &amp;c., I was told by one middle-aged
cap-maker, a very silly person, that she
would be worth 100,000<i>l.</i>, “if she had her rights.”
What those “rights” were she could not explain,
only that there was and had been a great deal of
money in the family, and of course she had a right
to her share, only she was kept out of it.</p>

<p>The youth in question never heard of a father,
and had been informed that his mother had died
when he was a baby. From what he told me, I
think it most probable that he was an illegitimate
child, for whose maintenance his father possibly
paid the 4<i>s.</i> a week, perhaps to some near relative
of the deceased mother. The old woman, as well
as I could make the matter out from his narrative,
died suddenly, and, as little was known about her,
she was buried by the parish, and the lad, on the
evening of the funeral, was to have been taken by
the landlord of the house where they lodged into
the workhouse; but the boy ran away before this
could be accomplished; the parish of course not objecting
to be relieved of an incumbrance. He
thought he was then about twelve or thirteen years
of age, and he had before run away from two schools,
one a Ragged-school, to which he had been sent,
“<i>for it was so confining</i>,” he said, “and one master,
not he as had the raggeds, leathered him,” to use
his own words, “tightly.” He knew his letters
now, he thought, but that was all, “and very few,”
he said, gravely, “would have put up with it so
long as I did.” He subsisted as well as he
could by selling matches, penny memorandum
books, onions, &amp;c., after he had run away,
sleeping under hedges in the country, or in
lodging-houses in town, and living on a few
pence a day, or “starving on nothink.” He
was taken ill, and believed it was of a fever,
at or somewhere about Portsmouth, and when
he was sufficiently recovered, and had given the
best account he could of himself, was passed to
his parish in London. The relieving officer, he
said, would have given him a pair of shoes and
half-a-crown, and let him “take his chance, but
the doctor wouldn’t sartify any ways.” He
meant, I think, that the medical officer found
him too ill to be at large on his own account. He
discharged himself, however, in a few weeks from
this parish workhouse, as he was convalescent.
“The grub there, you see, sir,” he said, “was
stunning good when I first went, but it fell
off.” As the probability is that there was no
change in the diet, it may not be unfair to conclude
that the regular meals of the establishment
were very relishable at first, and that afterwards
their very regularity and their little variation
made the recipient critical.</p>

<p>“When I left, sir,” he stated, “they guv me
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a tidy shirt, and a pair of blucherers,
and mended up my togs for me decent. I tried all
sorts of goes then. I went to Chalk-farm and some
other fairs with sticks for throwing, and used to
jump among them as throwing was going on, and
to sing out, ‘break my legs and miss my pegs.’ I
got many a knock, and when I did, oh! there <i>was</i>
such larfing at the fun on it. I sold garden sticks
too, and garden ropes, and posts sometimes; but it
was all wery poor pay. Sometimes I made 10<i>d.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
but not never I think but twice 1<i>s.</i> a day at it, and
oftener 6<i>d.</i>, and in bad weather there was nothink
to be done. If I made 6<i>d.</i> clear, it was 1<i>d.</i> for
cawfee&mdash;for I often went out fasting in a morning&mdash;and
1<i>d.</i> for bread and butter, and 1<i>d.</i> for pudden
for dinner, and another 1<i>d.</i> perhaps for beer&mdash;half-pint
and a farden out at the public bar&mdash;and 2<i>d.</i>
for a night’s lodging. I’ve had sometimes to leave
half my stock in flue with a deputy for a night’s
rest. O, I didn’t much mind the bugs, so I could
rest; and next day had to take my things out if
I could, and pay a hexter ha’penny or penny, for
hintrest, like. Yes, I’ve made 18<i>d.</i> a hevening
at a fair; but there’s so many a going it there
that one ruins another, and wet weather ruins the
whole biling, the pawillion, theaytres and all.
I never was a hactor, never; but I’ve thought
sometimes I’d like to try my hand at it. I may
some day, ’cause I’m tall. I was forced to go to
the parish again, for I got ill and dreadful weak,
and then they guv me work on the roads. I can’t
just say how long it’s since, two or three year
perhaps, but I had 9<i>d.</i> a day at first, and reglar
work, and then three days and three loaves a
week, and then three days and no loaves. I
haven’t been at it werry lately. I’ve rayther
taken the summer out of myself, but I must go
back soon, for cold weather’s a coming. Vy, I
lived a good deal on carrying trunks from the
busses to Euston Railway; a good many busses
stops in the New-road, in the middle of the
square. Some was foreigners, and they was werry
scaly. No, I never said nothink but once, ven I
got two French ha’pennies for carrying a heavy
old leather thing, like a coach box, as seemed to
belong to a family; and then the railway bobbies
made me hold my tongue. I jobbed about in
other places too, but the time’s gone by now. O,
I had a deal to put up with last winter. What is
9<i>d.</i> a day for three days? and if poor men had
their rights, times ’ud be different. I’d like to
know where all the money goes. I never counted
how many parish sweepers there was; too many by
arf. I’ve a rights to work, and it’s as little as a
parish can do to find it. I pay 1<i>s.</i> a week for half a
bed, and not half enough bed-clothes; but me and
Jack Smith sometimes sleeps in our clothes, and
sometimes spreads ’em o’ top. No, poor Jack, he
hasn’t no hold on a parish; he’s a mud-lark and
a gatherer [bone-grubber]. Do I like the overseers
and the parish officers? In course not, nobody
does. Why don’t they? Well, how can they?
that’s just where it is. Ven I haven’t been at
sweeping, I’ve staid in bed as long as I was let;
but Mother B.&mdash;I don’t know no other name she
has&mdash;wouldn’t stand it after ten. O no, it wern’t
a common lodging-house, a sort of private lodging-house
perhaps, where you took by the week. If
I made nothink but my ninepences, I lived on
bread and cawfee, or bread and coker, and sometimes
a red herring, and I’ve bought ’em in the
Brill at five and six a penny. Mother B. charged
&frac12;<i>d.</i> for leave to toast ’em on her gridiron.
She <i>is</i> a scaly old &mdash;&mdash;. <i>I’ve oft spent all my
money in a tripe supper at night, and fasted all
next day.</i> I used to walk about and look in at
the cook-shop windows, and try for a job next
day. <i>I’d have gone five miles for anybody for a
penn’orth of pudden.</i> No, I never thought of
making away with myself; never. Nor I never
thought of going for a soldier; <i>it wouldn’t suit
me to be tied so</i>. What I want is this here&mdash;regular
work and no jaw. O, I’m sometimes as
miserable as hunger’ll make a parson, if ever he
felt it. Yes, I go to church sometimes when I’m
at work for the parish, if I’m at all togged. No
doubt I shall die in the workus. You see
there’s nobody in the world cares for me. I can’t
tell just how I spend my money; just as it comes
into my head. No, I don’t care about drinking;
it don’t agree with me; but there’s some can live
on it. I don’t think as I shall ever marry, though
who knows?”</p>

<p>The third and last system of parish work is
where the labourer is employed regularly, and
paid a fixed wage, out of the parochial fund
certainly, but not in the same manner as the
paupers are paid, nor with any payment in
kind (as in loaves), but all in money. The payment
in this wise is usually 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, and, but
for such employment, the poor so employed,
would, in most instances, apply for relief.</p>

<p>In one parish, where the poor are regularly
employed in street sweeping, and paid a regular
wage in money, the whole scavaging work is done
by the paupers, as they are usually termed, though
they are not “on the rate.” By them the streets
are swept and the houses dusted, the granite
broken for macadamization, and the streets and
roads repaved or repaired. This is done by about
50 men, the labour in the different departments
I have specified being about equally apportioned
as to the number employed in each. The
work is executed without any direct intervention
of the parish officers employed in administering
<i>relief</i> to the poor, but through the agency of a
board. All the men, however, are the poor of
the parish, and but for this employment would or
might claim relief, or demand admittance with
their families into the workhouse. The system,
therefore, is one of indirect pauper labour.
Nearly all the men have been unskilled labourers,
the exception being now and then a few operatives
in such handicrafts as were suffering from the
dearth of employment. Some of the artizans, I
was informed, would be earning their 9<i>s.</i> in the
stone-yard one week, and the next getting 30<i>s.</i>
at their business. The men thus labouring for
the parish are about three-fifths Irishmen, a fifth
Welchmen, or rather more than a fifth, and the
remainder Englishmen. There is not a single
Scotchman among them.</p>

<p>There is no difference, in the parish I allude to,
between the wages of married and single men,
but men with families are usually preferred
among the applicants for such work. They all
reside in their own rooms, or sometimes in lodging-houses,
but this rests with themselves.</p>

<p>I had the following account from a heavy and
healthy-looking middle-aged man, dressed in a
jacket and trousers of coarse corduroy. There is
so little distinctive about it, however, that I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
not consume space in presenting it in the narrative
form in which I noted it down. It may suffice
that the man seemed to have little recollection as
to the past, and less care as to the future. His
life, from all I could learn from him, had been
spent in what may be called menial labour, as
the servant, not of an individual, but of a parish;
but there was nothing, he knew of, that he had
to thank anybody for&mdash;parish or any one. They
wanted <i>him</i> and he wanted <i>them</i>. On my asking
him if he had never tried to “better himself,”
he said that he <i>had</i> once as a navvy, but a blow on
the head and eye, from a portion of rock shivered
by his pick-axe, disabled him for awhile, and he
left railway work. He went to church, as was
expected of him, and he and his wife liked it.
He had forgotten how to read, but never was “a dab
at it,” and so “didn’t know nothing about the litany
or the psalms.” He couldn’t say as he knew any
difference between the Church of England and the
Roman Catholic church-goers, “cause the one was
a English and the t’ other a Irish religion,” and he
“wasn’t to be expected to understand Irish religion.”
He saw no necessity to put by money (this he
said hesitatingly), supposing he could; what was
his parish for? and he would take care he didn’t
lose his settlement. If he’d ever had such a
chance as some had he might have saved money,
but he never had. He had no family, and his
wife earned about 4<i>s.</i> a week, but not every week,
in a wool warehouse, and they did middling.</p>

<p>The above, then, are the modes in which paupers,
or imminent paupers, so to speak, are employed, and
in one way or other are <i>paid</i> for their labour, or
what is called paid, and who, although parish
menials, still reside in their own abodes, with the
opportunity, such as it is, of “looking out” for
better employment.</p>

<p>As to the <i>moral qualities of the street-sweeping
paupers</i> I do not know that they differ from those
of paupers generally. All men who feel themselves
sunk into compulsory labour and a degraded
condition are dissatisfied, and eager to throw the
blame of their degradation from their own
shoulders. But it is evident that these men are
unwilling workers, because their work is deprived
of its just reward; and although I did not hear
of any difficulty being experienced in getting
them to work, I was assured by many who knew
them well, that they do not go about it with any
alertness. Did any one ever hear a pauper
whistle or sing at his street-work? I believe that
every experienced vestryman will agree to the
truth of the statement that it is very rarely
a confirmed pauper rises from his degradation.
His thoughts and aspirations seem bounded
by the workhouse and the parish. The reason
appears to be because the workhouse authorities
seek rather to degrade than to elevate
the man, resorting to every means of shaming the
pauper, until at last he becomes so utterly callous
to the disgrace of pauperism that he does not
care to alter his position. The system, too,
adopted by the parish authorities of not paying
for work, or paying less than the ordinary prices
of the trade, causes the pauper labourers to be
unwilling workers; and finding that industry
brings no reward, or less than its fair reward, to
them, they get to hate all work, and to grow up
habitual burdens on the State. Crabbe, the poet,
who in all questions of borough and parish life is an
authority, makes his workhouse boy, Dick Monday,
who when a boy got more kicks than halfpence,
die Sir Richard Monday, of Monday-place;
but this is a flight on the wings of poetical
licence; certainly not impossible, and that is all
which can be said for its likelihood.</p>

<p>The following remarks on the payment of the
parish street-sweepers are from one of Mr.
Cochrane’s <span class="lock">publications:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The council considers it a duty to the poor to
touch upon the niggardly manner in which parish
scavengers are generally paid, and the deplorable
and emaciated condition which they usually present,
with regard to their clothing and personal
appearance. One contractor pays 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
week; 2 pay 16<i>s.</i>; 12 (including a Highway
Board) pay 15<i>s.</i> each; 1 pays 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 2 pay
14<i>s.</i>; and 1 pays so low as 12<i>s.</i> On the other
hand, five parish boards of ‘guardians of the
poor,’ pay only 9<i>s.</i> each, to their miserable mud-larks;
one pays 8<i>s.</i>; another 7<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>; a third 7<i>s.</i>;
a fourth compensates its labourers&mdash;in the British
metropolis, where rent and living are necessarily
higher than elsewhere&mdash;with 5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per week!
whilst a fifth pays 3 men 15<i>s.</i> each, 12 men 10<i>s.</i>
each, and 6 men 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, for exactly the
same kind of work!!! But what renders this
mean torture of men (because they happen to be
poor) absurd as well as cruel, are the anomalous
facts, that whilst the guardians of one parish pay
5 men 7<i>s.</i> each, the contractor for another part of
the same parish, pays his 4 men 14<i>s.</i> each;&mdash;and
whilst the guardians of a second parish pay only
5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, the Highway Board pays 15<i>s.</i> to each of
its labourers, for performing exactly the same work
in the same district!&mdash;Mr. Darke, scavenging contractor
of Paddington, lately stated that he never
had, and never would, employ any man at less than
16<i>s.</i> or 18<i>s.</i> per week;&mdash;and Mr. Sinnott, of Belvidere-road,
Lambeth, about three months since,
offered to certain West-End guardians, to take
40 paupers out of their own workhouse to cleanse
their own parish, on the street-orderly system;&mdash;and
to pay them 15<i>s.</i> per week each man<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; but
the economical guardians preferred filth and a full
workhouse, to cleanliness, Christian charity, and
common sense;&mdash;and so the proposal of this considerate
contractor was rejected! It is certainly
far from being creditable to boards of gentlemen
and wealthy tradesmen who manage parish affairs,
to pay little more than one-half the wages that an
individual does, to poor labourers who cannot
choose their employment or their masters....</p>

<p>“The broken-down tradesman, the journeyman
deprived of his usual work by panic or by poverty
of the times, the ingenious mechanic, or the unsuccessful
artist, applies at the parish labour-market
for leave to live by other labour than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which hitherto maintained him in comfort....
The usual language of such persons, even when
applying for private alms or parochial relief, is, not
that they want money, but ‘that they have long
been out of work;’ ‘that their particular trade
has been overstocked with apprentices, or superseded
by machinery;’ or, ‘that their late employer
has become bankrupt, or has discharged
the majority of his hands from the badness of the
times.’ To a man of this class, the guardian of
the poor replies, ‘We will test your willingness to
labour, by employing you in the stone-yard, or to
sweep the streets; but the parish being heavily
burthened with rates, we cannot afford more than
7<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> a week.’ The poor creature, conscious of
his own helplessness, accepts the miserable pittance,
in order to preserve himself and family from immediate
starvation....</p>

<p>“The council has taken much pains to ascertain
the wages, and mode of expenditure of
them, by this uncared-for, and almost pariah,
class of labourers throughout the metropolitan
parishes; and it possesses undeniable proofs, that
few possess any further garment than the rags
upon their backs; some being even without a
change of linen; that they never enter a place
of worship, on account of their want of decent
clothing; that their wives and children are
starved and in rags, and the latter without the
least education; that they never by any chance
taste fresh animal food; that one-third of their
hard earnings is paid for rent; and that their only
sustenance (unless their wives happen to go out
washing or charing), consists of bread, potatoes,
coarse tea without milk or sugar, a salt herring
two or three times a week, and a slice of rusty
bacon on Sunday morning! The meal called
dinner they never know; their only refection being
breakfast and ‘tea:’ beer they do not taste from
year’s end to year’s end; and any other luxury, or
even necessary, is out of the question.</p>

<p>“Of the 21 scavengers employed by St. James’s
parish in 1850, no less than 16,” says Mr. Cochrane’s
report, “were married, with from one to
four children each. How the poor creatures who
receive but 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week support their families, is
best known to themselves.”</p>

<p>Let me now, in conclusion, endeavour to arrive
at a rough estimate as to the sum of which the
pauper labours annually are mulct by the before-mentioned
rates of remuneration, estimating their
labour at the market value or amount paid by the
honourable contractors, viz. 16<i>s.</i> a week; for if
private individuals can afford to pay that wage,
and yet reap a profit out of the transaction, the
guardians of the poor surely could and should pay
the same prices, and not avail themselves of
starving men’s necessities to reduce the wages of a
trade to the very quick of subsistence. If it be a
sound principle that the condition of the pauper
should be rendered <i>less</i> desirable than that of the
labourer, assuredly the principle is equally sound
that the condition of the labourer should be made
<i>more</i> desirable than that of the pauper; for if to
pamper the pauper be to make indolence more
agreeable than industry, certainly to grind down
the wages of the labourer is to render industry
as unprofitable as indolence. In either case the
same premium is proffered to pauperism. As
yet the Poor-Law Commissioners have seen but
one way of reducing the poor-rates, viz., by rendering
the state of the pauper as <i>unenviable</i>
as possible, and they have wholly lost sight of
the other mode of attaining the same end, viz.,
by making the state of the labourer as <i>desirable</i>
as possible. To institute a terrible poor law without
maintaining an attractive form of industry, is
to hold out a boon to crime. If the wages of the
working man are to be reduced to bare subsistence,
and the condition of the pauper is to be rendered
worse than that of the working man, what atrocities
will not be committed upon the poor.
Elevate the condition of the labourer, and there
will be no necessity to depress the pauper. Make
work more attractive by increasing the reward for
it, and laziness will necessarily become more repulsive.
As it is, however, the pauper is not only
kept at the very lowest point of subsistence, but
his half-starved labour is brought into competition
with that of men living in a comparative state of
comfort; and the result, of course, is, that instead
of decreasing the number of paupers or
poor-rates, we make paupers of our labourers,
and fill our workhouses by such means. If a
scavager’s labour be worth from 12<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> per
week in the market, what moral right have the
<i>guardians of the poor</i> to pay 5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for the same
commodity? If the paupers are set to do work
which is fairly worth 15<i>s.</i>, then to pay them little
more than one-third of the regular value is not
only to make unwilling workers of the paupers,
but to drag down all the better workmen to the
level of the worst.</p>

<p>It may be estimated that the outlay on pauper
labour, as a whole, after deducting the sum paid
to superintendents and gangers, does not exceed
10<i>s.</i> weekly per individual; consequently the
lowering of the price of labour is in this ratio:
There are now, in round numbers, 450 pauper
scavagers in the metropolis, and the account
stands <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>Yearly.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">450 scavagers, at the regular weekly wages of 16<i>s.</i> each</td><td>£18,710</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">450 pauper labourers, 10<i>s.</i> each weekly</td><td>11,700</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Lower price of pauper work</td><td class="total">£7,020</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence we see, that the great scurf employers
of the scavagers, after all, are the guardians of
the poor, compared with whom the most grasping
contractor is a model of liberality.</p>

<p>That the minimum of remuneration paid by
the parishes has tended, and is tending more
and more, to the general depreciation of wages
in the scavaging trade, there is no doubt. It
has done so directly and indirectly. One man,
who had been a last-maker, told me that he left
his employment as a London scavager, for he had
“come down to the parish,” and set off at the
close of the summer into Kent for the harvest and
hopping, for, when in the country, he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
more used to agricultural labour than to last, clog,
or patten making. He considered that he had
not been successful; still he returned to London a
richer man by 26<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Nearly 20<i>s.</i> of this soon
went for shoes and necessary clothing, and to pay
some arrears of rent, and a chandler’s bill
he owed, after which he could be trusted again
where he was known. He applied to the foreman
of a contractor, whom he knew, for work.
“What wage?” said the foreman. “Fifteen
shillings a week,” was the reply. “Why, what
did you get from the parish for sweeping?” “Nine
shillings.” “Well,” said the foreman, “I know
you’re a decent man, and you were recommended
before, and so I <i>can</i> give you four or five days a
week at 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a day, and no nonsense about
hours; <i>for you know yourself I can get 50 men
as have been parish workers at 1s. 9d. a day, and
jump at it, and so you mustn’t be cheeky</i>.” The
man closed with the offer, knowing that the foreman
spoke the truth.</p>

<p>A contractor told me that he could obtain “plenty
of hands,” used to parish scavaging work, at
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a week, whereas he paid 16<i>s.</i></p>

<p>It is evident, then, that the system of pauper
work in scavaging has created an increasing
market for cheap and deteriorated labour, a
market including hundreds of the unemployed at
other unskilled labours; and it is hardly to be
doubted that the many who have faith in the
doctrine that it is the best policy to buy in the
cheapest and sell in the dearest market, will avail
themselves of the low-priced labour of this pauper-constituted
mart.</p>

<p>It is but right to add, that those parishes which
pay 15<i>s.</i> a week are as worthy of commendation
as those which pay 9<i>s.</i>, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 7<i>s.</i> per week,
and 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a day are reprehensible;
and, unfortunately, the latter have a tendency to
regulate all the others.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Street-Orderlies.</span></h3>

<p>This constitutes the last of the four varieties of
labour employed in the cleansing of the public
thoroughfares of London. I have already treated
of the self-supporting manual labour, the self-supporting
machine labour, and the pauper labour,
and now proceed to the consideration of the philanthropic
labour of the streets.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us understand clearly
what is meant by philanthropic labour, and how
it is distinguished from pauper labour on the one
hand, and self-supporting labour on the other.
Self-supporting labour I take to be that form of
work which returns not less, and generally something
more, than is expended upon it. Pauper
labour, on the other hand, is work to which the
applicants for parish relief are “set,” not with a
view to the profit to be derived from it, but partly
as a test of their willingness to work, and partly
as a means of employing the unemployed; while
philanthropic labour is employment provided for
the unemployed with the same disregard of
profit as distinguishes pauper labour, but with a
greater regard for the poor, and as a means of
affording them relief in a less degrading manner
than is done under the present Poor Law.
Pauper and philanthropic labour, then, differ
essentially from self-supporting labour in being
<i>non-profitable</i> modes of employment; that is to
say, they yield so bare an equivalent for the
sum expended upon the labourers, that none, in
the ordinary way of trade, can be found to provide
the means necessary for putting them into
operation: while pauper labour differs from
philanthropic labour, in the fact that the funds
requisite for “setting the poor on work” are provided
by law as a matter of social policy, whereas,
in the case of philanthropic labour, the funds, or a
part of them, are supplied by voluntary contributions,
out of a desire to improve the labourers’
condition. There are, then, two distinguishing
features in all philanthropic labour&mdash;the one is,
that it yields no profit (if it did it would become
a matter of trade), and the other, that it is instituted
and maintained from a wish to benefit the
labourer.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>STREET ORDERLIES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Street-Orderly system forms part of the
operations on behalf of the poor adopted by a
society, of which Mr. Charles Cochrane is the
president, entitled the “National Philanthropic
Association,” which is said to have for its object
“the promotion of social and salutiferous improvements,
street cleanliness, and the employment of
the poor, so that able-bodied men may be prevented
from burthening the parish-rate, and preserved
independent of workhouse, alms, and
degradation.” Here a twofold object is expressed:
the Philanthropic Association seeks not
only to benefit the poor by giving them employment,
and “preserving them independent of workhouse,
alms, and degradation,” but to benefit the
public likewise, by “promoting social and salutiferous
improvements and street cleanliness.” I
shall deal with each of these objects separately;
but first let me declare, so as to remove all suspicion
of private feelings tending in any way to
bias my judgment in this most important matter,
that I am an utter stranger to the President and
Council of the Philanthropic Association; and
that, whatever I may have to say on the subject
of the street-orderlies, I do simply in conformity
with my duty to the public&mdash;to state truthfully all
that concerns the labourers and the poor of the
metropolis.</p>

<p><i>Viewed economically, philanthropic and pauper
work may be said to be the regulators of the
minimum rate of wages</i>&mdash;establishing the lowest
point to which competition can possibly drive
down the remuneration for labour; for it is evident,
that if the self-supporting labourer cannot
obtain greater comforts by the independent exercise
of his industry than the parish rates or private
charity will afford him, he will at once give over
working for the trading employer, and declare on
the funds raised by assessment or voluntary subscription
for his support. Hence, those who wish
well to the labourer, and who believe that cheapness
of commodities is desirable “only,” as Mr.
Stewart Mill says (p. 502, vol. ii.), “when the
cause of it is, that their production costs little
labour, and not when occasioned by that labour’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
being ill-remunerated;” and who believe, moreover,
that the labourer is to be benefited solely
by the cultivation of a high standard of comfort
among the people&mdash;to such, I say, it
is evident, that a poor law which reduces the
relief to able-bodied labourers to the smallest
modicum of food consistent with the continuation
of life must be about the greatest
curse that can possibly come upon an over-populated
country, admitting, as it does, of the reduction
of wages to so low a point of mere brutal existence
as to induce that recklessness and
improvidence among the poor which is known to
give so strong an impetus to the increase of the
people. A minimized rate of parish relief is
necessarily a minimized rate of wages, and admits
of the labourers’ pay being reduced, by pauper
competition, to little short of starvation; and
such, doubtlessly, would have been the case long
ago in the scavaging trade by the employment of
parish labour, had not the Philanthropic Association
instituted the system of street-orderlies, and
by the payment of a higher rate of wages than
the more grinding parishes afforded&mdash;by giving
the men 12<i>s.</i> instead of 9<i>s.</i> or even 7<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;prevented
the remuneration of the regular hands
being dragged down to an approximation to the
parish level. Hence, rightly viewed, philanthropic
labour&mdash;and, indeed, pauper labour too&mdash;comes
under the head of a remedy for low wages, as
preventing, if properly regulated, the undue depreciation
of industry from excessive competition, and
it is in this light that I shall now proceed to consider
it.</p>

<p>The several plans that have been propounded
from time to time, as remedies for an insufficient
rate of remuneration for work, are as multifarious
as the circumstances influencing the three requisites
for production&mdash;labour, capital, and land. I
will here run over as briefly as possible&mdash;abstaining
from the expression of all opinion on the subject&mdash;the
various schemes which have been proposed
with this object, so that the reader may come as
prepared as possible to the consideration of the
matter.</p>

<p>The remedies for low wages may be arranged
into two distinct groups, viz., those which seek to
increase the labourer’s rate of pay <i>directly</i>, and
those which seek to do so <i>indirectly</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>direct</i> remedies for low wages that have
been propounded <span class="lock">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. <i>The establishment of a standard rate of remuneration
for labour.</i> This has been proposed
to be brought about by three different
means, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. By law or government authority; either
(<i>a</i>) fixing the minimum rate of wages, and
leaving the variations above that point to
be adjusted by competition (this, as we
have seen, is the effect of the poor-law);
or, (<i>b</i>) settling the rate of wages generally
by means of local boards of trade for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conseils de prud’hommes</i>, consisting of
delegates from the workmen and employers,
to determine, by the principles of
natural equity, a <i>reasonable</i> scale of remuneration
in the several trades, their decision
being binding in law on both the
employers and the employed.</p>

<p>2. By public opinion; this has been generally
proposed by those who are what Mr.
Mill terms “shy of admitting the interference
of authority in contracts for
labour,” fearing that if the law intervened
it would do so rashly and ignorantly, and
desiring to compass by <i>moral</i> sanction
what they consider useless or dangerous to
attempt to bring about by <i>legal</i> means.
“Every employer,” says Mr. Mill, “they
think, <i>ought</i> to give <i>sufficient wages</i>,” and
if he does not give such wages willingly,
he should be compelled to do so by public
opinion.</p>

<p>3. By trade societies or combination among
the workmen; that is to say, by the payment
of a small sum per week out of the
wages of the workmen, towards the formation
of a fund for the support of such of
their fellow operatives as may be out of
employment, or refuse to work for those
employers who seek to give less than the
standard rate of wages established by the
trade.</p></div>

<p>B. <i>The prohibition of stoppages or deductions
of all kinds from the nominal wages of
workmen.</i> This is principally the object of
the Anti-Truck Society, which seeks to
obtain an Act of Parliament, enjoining the
payment in full of all wages. The stoppages
or extortions from workmen’s wages generally
consist <span class="lock">of:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Fines for real or pretended misconduct.</p>

<p>2. Rents for tools, frames, gas, and sometimes
lodgings.</p>

<p>3. Sale of trade appliances (as trimmings,
thread, &amp;c.) at undue prices.</p>

<p>4. Sale of food, drink, &amp;c., at an exorbitant
rate of profit.</p>

<p>5. Payment in public-houses; as the means
of inducing the men to spend a portion of
their earnings in drink.</p>

<p>6. Deposit of money as security before taking
out work; so that the capital of the employer
is increased without payment of
interest to the workpeople.</p></div>

<p>C. <i>The institution of certain aids or additions
to wages</i>; <span class="lock">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Perquisites or gratuities obtained from the
public; as with waiters, boxkeepers, coachmen,
dustmen, vergers, and others.</p>

<p>2. Beer money, and other “allowances” to
workmen.</p>

<p>3. Family work; or the co-operation of the
wife and children as a means of increasing
the workman’s income.</p>

<p>4. Allotments of land, to be cultivated after
the regular day’s labour.</p>

<p>5. The parish “allowance system,” or relief
in aid of wages, as practised under the old
Poor Law.</p></div>

<p>D. <i>The increase of the money value of wages</i>;
<span class="lock">by&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Cheap food.</p>

<p>2. Cheap lodgings; through building improved
dwellings for the poor, and doing
away with the profit of sub-letting.</p>

<p>3. Co-operative stores; or the “club system”
of obtaining provisions at wholesale prices.</p>

<p>4. The abolition of the payment of wages on
Sunday morning, or at so late an hour on
the Saturday night as to prevent the
labourer availing himself of the Saturday’s
market.</p>

<p>5. Teetotalism; as causing the men to spend
nothing in fermented drinks, and so leaving
them more to spend on food.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Such are the <i>direct</i> modes of remedying low
wages, viz., either by preventing the price of
labour itself falling below a certain standard;
prohibiting all stoppages from the pay of the labourer;
instituting certain aids or additions to
such pay; or increasing the money value of the
ordinary wages by reducing the price of provisions.</p>

<p>The <i>indirect</i> modes of remedying low wages are
of a far more complex character. They consist of,
first, the remedies propounded by political economists,
which <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. <i>The decrease of the number of labourers</i>;
for gaining this end several plans have been
proposed, <span class="lock">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Checks against the increase of the population,
for which the following are the chief
Malthusian <span class="lock">proposals:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a.</i> Preventive checks for the hindrance of
impregnation.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Prohibition of early marriages among
the poor.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Increase of the standard of comfort, or
requirements, among the people; as a
means of inducing prudence and restraint
of the passions.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Infanticide; as among the Chinese.</p></div>

<p>2. Emigration; as a means of draining off the
surplus labourers.</p>

<p>3. Limitation of apprentices in skilled trades;
as a means of preventing the undue increase
of particular occupations. This,
however, is advocated not by economists,
but generally by operatives.</p>

<p>4. Prevention of family work; or the discouragement
of the labour of the wives and
children of operatives. This, again, cannot
be said to be an “economist” remedy.</p></div>

<p>B. <i>Increase of the circulating capital, or sum
set aside for the payment of the labourers.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. By government imposts. “Governments,”
says Mr. Mill, “can create additional industry
by creating capital. They may lay
on taxes, and employ the amount productively.”
This was the object of the
original Poor Law (43 Eliz.), which empowered
the overseers of the poor to
“raise weekly, or otherwise, by taxation
of every inhabitant, &amp;c., such sums of
money as they shall require for providing
a sufficient stock of flax, hemp, wool, and
other ware or stuff, to set the poor on work.”</p>

<p>2. By the issue of paper money. The proposition
of Mr. Jonathan Duncan is, that
the government should issue notes equivalent
to the taxation of the country, with
the view of affording increased employment
to the poor; the people being set to work
as it were upon credit, in the same manner
as the labourers were employed to build
the market-house at Guernsey.</p></div>

<p>C. <i>The extension of the markets of the country</i>;
by the abolition of all restrictions on commerce,
and the encouragement of the free
interchange of commodities, so that, by increasing
the demand for our products, we
may be able to afford employment to an
extra number of producers.</p></div>

<p>The above constitute what, with a few exceptions,
may be termed, more particularly, the “economist”
remedies for low wages.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>D. <i>The regulation of the quantity of work done
by each workman, or the prevention of the
undue economizing of labour.</i> For this end,
several means have been put forward.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The shortening the hours of labour, and
abolition of Sunday-work.</p>

<p>2. Alteration of the mode of work; as the
substitution of day-work for piece-work, as
a means of decreasing the stimulus to overwork.</p>

<p>3. Extension of the term of hiring; by the
substitution of annual engagements for
daily or weekly hirings, with a view to
the prevention of “casual labour.”</p>

<p>4. Limitation of the number of hands employed
by one capitalist; so as to prevent
the undue extension of “the large system
of production.”</p>

<p>5. Taxation of machinery; with the object,
not only of making it contribute its quota
to the revenue of the country, but of impeding
its undue increase.</p>

<p>6. The discountenance of every form of work
that tends to the making up of a greater
quantity of materials with a less quantity
of labour; and consequently to the expenditure
of a greater proportion of the capital
of the country on machinery or materials,
and a correspondingly less proportion on
the labourers.</p></div>

<p>E. <i>“Protective imposts,” or high import duties
on such foreign commodities as can be produced
in this country</i>; with the view of preventing
the labour of the comparatively
untaxed and uncivilized foreigner being
brought into competition with that of the
taxed and civilized producer at home.</p>

<p>F. <i>“Financial reform,” or reduction of the
taxation of the country</i>; as enabling the home
labourer the better to compete with the
foreigner.</p></div>

<p>The two latter proposals, and that of the extension
of the markets, may be said to seek to
remedy low wages by expanding or circumscribing
the foreign trade of the country.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>G. <i>A different division of the proceeds of
labour.</i> For this object several schemes
have been <span class="lock">propounded:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The “tribute system” of wages; or payment
of labour according to the additional value
which it confers on the materials on which
it operates.</p>

<p>2. The abolition of the middleman; whether
“sweater,” “piece-master,” “lumper,” or
what not, coming between the employer
and employed.</p>

<p>3. Co-operation; or joint-stock associations of
labourers, with the view of abolishing the
profit of the capitalist employer.</p></div>

<p>H. <i>A different mode of distributing the products
of labour</i>; with the view of abolishing
the profit of the dealer, between the producer
and consumer&mdash;as co-operative stores, where
the consumers club together for the purchase
of their goods directly of the producers.</p>

<p>I. <i>A more general and equal division of the
wealth of the country</i>: for attaining this end
there are but two known <span class="lock">means:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Communism; or the abolition of all rights
to individual property.</p>

<p>2. Agapism; or the voluntary sharing of
individual possessions with the less fortunate
or successful members of the community.</p></div></div>

<p>These remedies may, with a few exceptions
(such as the tribute system of wages, and
the abolition of middlemen), be said to constitute
the socialist and communist schemes for the prevention
of distress.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>J. <i>Creating additional employment for the
poor</i>; and so removing the surplus labour
from the market. Two modes of effecting
this have been <span class="lock">proposed:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Home colonization, or the cultivation of
waste lands by the poor.</p>

<p>2. Orderlyism, or the employment of the
poor in the promotion of public cleanliness,
and the increased sanitary condition of the
country.</p></div>

<p>K. <i>The prevention of the enclosure of commons</i>;
as the means of enabling the poor to
obtain gratuitous pasturage for their cattle.</p>

<p>L. <i>The abolition of primogeniture</i>; with the
view of dividing the land among a greater
number of individuals.</p>

<p>M. <i>The holding of the land by the State</i>, and
equal apportionment of it among the poor.</p>

<p>N. <i>Extension of the suffrage among the people</i>;
and so allowing the workman, as well as the
capitalist and the landlord, to take part in
the formation of the laws of the country.
For this purpose there are two <span class="lock">plans:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. “The freehold-land movement,” which
seeks to enable the people to become proprietors
of as much land as will, under the
present law, give them “a voice” in the
country.</p>

<p>2. Chartism, or that which seeks to alter the
law concerning the election of members of
Parliament, and to confer the right of
voting on every male of mature age, sound
mind, and non-criminal character.</p></div>

<p>O. <i>Cultivation of a higher moral and Christian
character among the people.</i> This form
of remedy, which is advocated by many, is
based on the argument, that, without some
mitigation of the “selfishness of the times,” all
other schemes for improving the condition of
the people will be either evaded by the
cunning of the rich, or defeated by the
servility of the poor.</p></div>

<p>The above I believe to be a full and fair statement
of the several plans that have been proposed,
from time to time, for alleviating the distress of
the people. This enumeration is as comprehensive
as my knowledge will enable me to make it; and I
have abstained from all comment on the several
schemes, so that the reader may have an opportunity
of impartially weighing the merits of each,
and adopting that, which in his own mind, seems
best calculated to effect what, after all, we every
one desire&mdash;whether protectionist, economist, free-trader,
philanthropist, socialist, communist, or
chartist&mdash;the good of the country in which we
live, and the people by whom we are surrounded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now we have to deal here with that particular
remedy for low wages or distress which consists
in creating additional employment for the poor,
and of which the street-orderly system is an
example.</p>

<p>The increase of employment for the poor was
the main object of the 43 Eliz., for which purpose,
as we have seen, the overseers of the several
parishes were empowered to raise a fund by
assessments upon the property of the rich, for
providing “a sufficient stock of flax, hemp, wool,
and other ware or stuff, to set the poor on work.”
But though economists, to this day, tell us that
“while, on the one hand, industry is limited by
capital, so, on the other, every increase of capital
gives, or is capable of giving, additional employment
to industry, and this without assignable
limit,”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> nevertheless the great difficulty of carrying
out the provisions of the original poor-law
has consisted in finding a market for the products
of pauper labour, for the frequent gluts in our
manufactures are sufficient to teach us that it is
one thing to produce and another to dispose of
the products; so that to create additional employment
for the poor something besides capital is
requisite: it is necessary either that they shall be
engaged in producing that which they themselves
immediately consume, or that for which the
market admits of being extended.</p>

<p>The two plans proposed for the employment of
the poor, it will be seen, consist (1) in the cultivation
of waste lands; (2) in promoting public
cleanliness, and so increasing the sanitary condition
of the country. The first, it is evident, removes
the objection of a market being needed for the
products of the labour of the poor, since it pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>poses
that their energies should be devoted to the
production of the food which they themselves
consume; while the second seeks to create additional
employment in effecting that increased
cleanliness which more enlightened physiological
views have not only made more desirable, but
taught us to be absolutely necessary to the health
and enjoyment of the community.</p>

<p>The great impediment, however, to the profitable
employment of the poor, has generally been
the unproductive or unavailing character of pauper
labour. This has been mainly owing to the fact
that the able-bodied who are deprived of employment
are necessarily the lowest grade of operatives;
for, in the displacement of workmen, those
are the first discarded whose labour is found to
be the least efficient, either from a deficiency of
skill, industry, or sobriety, so that pauper labour
is necessarily of the least productive character.</p>

<p>Another great difficulty with the employment
of the poor is, that the idle, or those to whom
work is more than usually irksome, require a
stronger inducement than ordinary to make them
labour, and the remuneration for parish work
being necessarily less than for any other, those
who are pauperized through idleness (the most
benevolent among us must allow there are such)
are naturally less than ever disposed to labour
when they become paupers. All pauper work,
therefore, is generally unproductive or unavailing,
because it is either inexpert or unwilling
work. The labour of the in-door paupers, who receive
only their food for their pains, is necessarily
of the same compulsory character as slavery;
while that of the out-door paupers, with the remuneration
often cut down to the lowest subsisting
point, is scarcely of a more willing or more
availing kind.</p>

<p>Owing to this general unproductiveness, (as well
as the difficulty of finding a field for the profitable
employment of the unemployed poor,) the labour
of paupers has been for a long time past directed
mainly to the cleansing of the public thoroughfares.
Still, from the degrading nature of the
occupation, and the small remuneration for the
toil, pauper labourers have been found to be such
unwilling workers that many parishes have long
since given over employing their poor even in
this capacity, preferring to entrust the work to a
contractor, with his paid self-supporting operatives,
instead.</p>

<p>The founder of the Philanthropic Association
appears to have been fully aware of the two great
difficulties besetting the profitable employment of
the poor, viz., (1) finding a field for the exercise
of their labours where they might be “set on work”
with benefit to the community, and without injury
to the independent operatives already engaged
in the same occupation; and (2) overcoming
the unwillingness, and consequently the unavailingness,
of pauper labour.</p>

<p>The first difficulty Mr. Cochrane has endeavoured
to obviate by taking advantage of that
growing desire for greater public cleanliness which
has arisen from the increased knowledge of the
principles governing the health of towns; and the
second, by giving the men 12<i>s.</i> instead of 9<i>s.</i> or
7<i>s.</i> a week, or worse than all, 1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> and a
quartern loaf a day for three days in the week,
and so not only augmenting the stimulus to
work (for it should be remembered that wages
are to the human machine what the fire is to
the steam-engine), but preventing the undue
depreciation of the labour of the independent
workman. He who discovers the means of increasing
the rewards of labour, is as great a friend
to his race as he who strives to depreciate
them is the public enemy; and I do not hesitate
to confess, that I look upon Mr. Charles
Cochrane as one of the illustrious few who, in
these days of unremunerated toil, and their necessary
concomitants&mdash;beggars and thieves, has come
forward to help the labourers of this country
from their daily-increasing degradation. His
benevolence is of that enlightened order which
seeks to extend rather than destroy the self-trust
of the poor, not only by creating additional employment
for them, but by rendering that employment
less repulsive.</p>

<p>The means by which Mr. Cochrane has endeavoured
to gain these ends constitutes the system
called Street-Orderlyism, which therefore admits of
being viewed in two distinct aspects&mdash;first, as a
new mode of improving “the health of towns,”
and, secondly, as an improved method of employing
the poor.</p>

<p>Concerning the first, I must confess that the
system of scavaging or cleansing the public
thoroughfares pursued by the street-orderlies
assumes, when contemplated in a sanitary point
of view, all the importance and simplicity of a
great discovery. It has been before pointed out
that this system consists not only in cleansing
the streets, but in <i>keeping</i> them clean. By the
street-orderly method of scavaging, the thoroughfares
are continually being cleansed, and so never
allowed to become dirty; whereas, by the ordinary
method, they are not cleansed <i>until</i> they are
dirty. Hence the two modes of scavaging are
diametrically opposed; under the one the streets
are cleansed as fast as dirtied, while under the
other they are dirtied as fast as cleansed; so that
by the new system of scavaging the public thoroughfares
are maintained in a perpetual state of
cleanliness, whereas by the old they may be said
to be kept in a continual state of dirt.</p>

<p>The street-orderly system of scavaging, however,
is not only worthy of high commendation as a more
efficient means of gaining a particular end&mdash;a
simplification of a certain process&mdash;but it calls for
our highest praise as well for the end gained as
for the means of gaining it. If it be really a
sound physiological principle, that the Creator has
made dirt offensive to every rightly-constituted
mind, because it is injurious to us, and so established
in us an instinct, before we could discover
a reason, for removing all refuse from our presence,
it becomes, now that we have detected the cause
of the feeling in us, at once disgusting and irrational
to allow the filth to accumulate in our
streets in front of our houses. If typhus, cholera,
and other pestilences are but divine punishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
inflicted on us for the infraction of that most
kindly law by which the health of a people has
been made to depend on that which is naturally
agreeable&mdash;cleanliness, then our instinct for self-preservation
should force us, even if our sense of
enjoyment would not lead us, to remove as fast as
it is formed what is at once as dangerous as it
should be repulsive to our natures. Sanitarily
regarded, the cleansing of a town is one of the
most important objects that can engage the attention
of its governors; the removal of its refuse
being quite as necessary for the continuance of
the existence of a people as the supply of their
food. In the economy of Nature there is no loss:
this the great doctrine of waste and supply has
taught us; the detritus of one rock is the conglomerate
of another; the evaporation of the
ocean is the source of the river; the poisonous
exhalations of animals the vital air of plants; and
the refuse of man and beasts the food of their
food. The dust and cinders from our fires, the
“slops” from the washing of our houses, the excretions
of our bodies, the detritus and “surface-water”
of our streets, have all their offices to
perform in the great scheme of creation; and if
left to rot and fust about us not only injure our
health, but diminish the supplies of our food. The
filth of the thoroughfares of the metropolis forms,
it would appear, the staple manure of the market-gardens
in the suburbs; out of the London mud
come the London cabbages: so that an improvement
in the scavaging of the metropolis tends not
only to give the people improved health, but improved
vegetables; for that which is nothing but
a pestiferous muck-heap in the town becomes a
vivifying garden translated to the country.</p>

<p>Dirt, however, is not only as prejudicial to our
health and offensive to our senses, when allowed to
accumulate in our streets, as it is beneficial to us
when removed to our gardens,&mdash;but it is a most
expensive commodity to keep in front of our
houses. It has been shown, that the cost to the
people of London, in the matter of extra washing
induced by defective scavaging, is at the least
1,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling per annum (the Board of
Health estimate it at 2,500,000<i>l.</i>); and the loss
from extra wear and tear of clothes from brushing
and scrubbing, arising from the like cause, is about
the same prodigious sum; while the injury done
to the furniture of private houses, and the goods
exposed for sale in shops, though impossible to be
estimated&mdash;appears to be something enormous: so
that the loss from the defective scavaging of the
metropolis seems, at the lowest calculation, to
amount to several millions per annum; and hence
it becomes of the highest possible importance,
economically as well as physiologically, that the
streets should be cleansed in the most effective
manner.</p>

<p>Now, that the street-orderly system is the only
rational and efficacious mode of street cleansing
both theory and practice assure us. To allow the
filth to accumulate in the streets before any steps
are taken to remove it, is the same as if we were
never to wash our bodies until they were dirty&mdash;it
is to be perpetually striving to cure the disease,
when with scarcely any more trouble we might
prevent it entirely. There is, indeed, the same
difference between the new and the old system of
scavaging, as there is between a bad and a good
housewife: the one never cleaning her house until
it is dirty, and the other continually cleaning it,
so as to prevent it being ever dirty.</p>

<p>Hence it would appear, that the street-orderly
system of scavaging would be a great public
benefit, even were there no other object connected
with it than the increased cleanliness of our
streets; but in a country like Great Britain,
afflicted as it is with a surplus population (no
matter from what cause), that each day finds the
difficulty of obtaining work growing greater, the
opening up of new fields of employment for the
poor is perhaps the greatest benefit that can be
conferred upon the nation. Without the discovery
of such new fields, “the setting the poor
on work” is merely, as I have said, to throw out
of employment those who are already employed;
it is not to decrease, but really to increase, the
evil of the times&mdash;to add to, rather than diminish,
the number of our paupers or our thieves. The
increase of employment in a nation, however, requires,
not only a corresponding increase of
capital, but a like increase in the demand or
desire, as well as in the pecuniary means, of the
people to avail themselves of the work on which
the poor are set (that is to say, in the extension of
the home market); it requires, also, some mode of
stimulating the energies of the workers, so as to
make them labour more willingly, and consequently
more availingly, than usual. These conditions
appear to have been fulfilled by Mr. Cochrane, in
the establishment of the street-orderlies. He has
introduced, in connection with this body, a system
of scavaging which, while it employs a greater
number of hands, produces such additional benefits
as cannot but be considered an equivalent for
the increased expenditure; though it is even
doubtful whether, by the collection of the street
manure unmixed with the mud, the extra
value of that article alone will not go far to compensate
for the additional expense; if, however,
there be added to this the saving to the metropolitan
parishes in the cost of watering the streets&mdash;for
under the street-orderly system this is not required,
the dust never being allowed to accumulate,
and consequently never requiring to be “laid”&mdash;as
well as the greater saving of converting the
paupers into self-supporting labourers; together
with the diminished expense of washing and
doctors’ bills, consequent on the increased cleanliness
of the streets&mdash;there cannot be the least doubt
that the employment of the poor as street-orderlies
is no longer a matter of philanthropy,
but of mere commercial prudence.</p>

<p>Such appear to me to be the principal objects
of Mr. Cochrane’s street-orderly system of scavaging;
and it is a subject upon which I have spoken
the more freely, because, being unacquainted with
that gentleman, none can suspect me of being prejudiced
in his favour, and because I have felt that
the good which he has done and is likely to do
to the poor, has been comparatively unacknow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>ledged
by the public, and that society and the
people owe him a heavy debt of gratitude<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to set forth the character of
the labour, and the condition and remuneration of
the labourers in connection with the street-orderly
system of scavaging the metropolitan thoroughfares.</p>

<p>The first appearance of the street-orderlies in
the metropolis was in 1843. Mr. Charles Cochrane,
who had previously formed the National Philanthropic
Association, with its eleemosynary soup-kitchens,
&amp;c., then introduced the system of street-orderlies,
as one enabling many destitute men to
support themselves by their labour; as well as,
in his estimation, a better, and eventually a more
economical, mode of street-cleansing, and partaking
also somewhat of the character of a street police.</p>

<p>The first “demonstration,” or display of the
street-orderly system, took place in Regent-street,
between the Quadrant and the Regent-circus, and
in Oxford-street, between Vere-street and Charles-street.
The streets were thoroughly swept in
the morning, and then each man or boy, provided
with a hand-broom and dust-pan, removed any dirt
as soon as it was deposited. The demonstration
was pronounced highly successful and the system
effective, in the opinion of eighteen influential
inhabitants of the locality who acted as a committee,
and who publicly, and with the authority
of their names, testified their conviction that “the
most efficient means of keeping streets clean, and
more especially great thoroughfares, was to prevent
the accumulation of dirt, by removing the
manure within a few minutes after it has been
deposited by the passing cattle; the same having,
hitherto, remained during several days.”</p>

<p>The cost of this demonstration amounted to
about 400<i>l.</i>, of which, the Report states, “200<i>l.</i>
still remains due from the shop-keepers to the
Association; which,” it is delicately added, “from
late commercial difficulties they have not yet
repaid” (in 1850).</p>

<p>Whilst the street-orderlies were engaged in cleansing
Regent-street, &amp;c., the City Commissioners of
the sewers of London were invited to depute some
person to observe and report to them concerning
the method pursued; but with that instinctive sort
of repugnance which seems to animate the great
bulk of city officials against improvement of any
kind, the reply was, that they “did not consider
the same worthy their attention.” The matter,
however, was not allowed to drop, and by the
persevering efforts of Mr. Cochrane, the president,
and of the body of gentlemen who form the Council
of the Association, Cheapside, Cornhill, and the most
important parts of the very heart of the city were at
length cleansed according to the new method. The
ratepayers then showed that <i>they</i>, at least, <i>did</i>
consider “the same worthy of attention,” for 8000
out of 12,000 within a few days signed memorials
recommending the adoption of what they pronounced
an improvement, and a public meeting
was held in Guildhall (May 4, 1846), at which
resolutions in favour of the street-orderly method
were passed. The authorities did not adopt these
recommendations, but they ventured so far to depart
from their venerable routine as to order the
streets to be “swept every day!” This employed
upwards of 300 men, whereas at the period when
the sages of the city sewers did not consider any
proposed improvement in scavagery worthy their
attention, the number of men employed by them
in cleansing the streets did not exceed 30.</p>

<p>The street-orderly system was afterwards tried
in the parishes of St. Paul, Covent-garden, St.
James (Westminster), St. Martin-in-the-Fields,
St. Anne, Soho, and others&mdash;sometimes calling forth
opposition, of course from the authorities connected
with the established modes of paving,
scavaging, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to write a complete history
of the street-orderlies, but merely to sketch
their progress, as well as describe their peculiar
characteristics.</p>

<p>Within these few months public meetings
have been held in almost every one of the 26
wards of the City, at which approving resolutions
were either passed unanimously or carried by large
majorities; and the street-orderly system is now
about to be introduced into St. Martin’s parish
instead of the street-sweeping machine.</p>

<p>As far as the street-orderly system has been
tried, and judging only by the testimony of public
examination and public record of opinion, the trial
has certainly been a success. A memorial to the
Court of Sewers, from the ward of Broad-street,
supported by the leading merchants of that locality,
in recommendation of the employment of street-orderlies,
seems to bear more closely on the subject
than any I have yet seen.</p>

<p>“Your memorialists,” they state, “have observed
that those public thoroughfares within the
city of London which are now cleansed by street-orderlies,
<i>are so remarkably clean</i> as to be <i>almost
free from mud in wet, and dust in dry weather</i>&mdash;that
<i>such extreme cleanliness is of great comfort to
the public</i>, and tends to improve the sanitary condition
of the ward.”</p>

<p>But it is not only in the metropolis that the
street-orderlies seem likely to become the established
scavagers. The streets of Windsor, I am
informed, are now in the course of being cleansed
upon the orderly plan. In Amsterdam, there are
at present 16 orderlies regularly employed upon
scavaging a portion of the city, and in Paris and
Belgium, I am assured, arrangements are being
made for the introduction of the system into both
those cities. Were the street-orderly mode of
scavaging to become general throughout this
country, it is estimated that employment would be
given to 100,000 labourers, so that, with the
families of these men, not less than half a million
of people would be supported in a state of independence
by it. The total number of adult able-bodied
paupers relieved&mdash;in-door and out-door&mdash;throughout
England and Wales, on January 1,
1850, was 154,525.</p>

<p>The following table shows the route of the street-orderly
operations in the metropolis. A further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
column, in the Report from which the table has been
extracted, contained the names of thirteen clergymen
who have “weekly read prayers and delivered
discourses to the street-orderlies at their respective
stations, and recorded flattering testimonials of
their conduct and demeanour.”</p>

<p>The period of nine years comprised in the above
statement (1843 and 1851 being both included)
gives a yearly average, as to the number of the
poor employed, exceeding 60, with a similar average
of 210 wives and children, and a yearly average
outlay of 420<i>l.</i> The number of orderlies now
employed by the Association is from 80 to 90.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, then, is a brief account of the rise and
progress of this new mode of street-sweeping, and
we now come to a description of the work itself.</p>

<p>“The orderlies,” says the Report of the Association,
“keep the streets free from mud in
winter, and dust in summer; and that with the
least possible personal drudgery:&mdash;adhering to the
principle of operation laid down, viz., that of
‘<i>Cleansing and keeping Clean</i>,’ they have merely,
after each morning’s sweeping and removal of dirt,
to keep a vigilant look-out over the surface of street
allotted to them; and to remove with the hand-brush
and dust-pan, from any particular spot,
whatever dirt or rubbish may fall upon it, <i>at the
moment of its deposit</i>. Thus are the streets under
their care kept constantly clean.</p>

<p>“But sweeping and removing dirt,” continues
the Report, “is not the only occupation
of the street-orderly, whilst keeping up a careful
inspection of the ground allotted to him. He
is also the watchman of house-property and
shop-goods; the guardian of reticules, pocket-books,
purses, and watch-pockets;&mdash;the experienced
observer and detector of pickpockets;
the ever ready, though unpaid, auxiliary to the
police constable. Nay, more;&mdash;he is always at
hand, to render assistance to both equestrian and
pedestrian: if a horse slip, stumble, or fall,&mdash;if
a carriage break down, or vehicles come into collision,&mdash;the
street-orderly darts forward to raise
and rectify them: if foot-passengers be run over,
or knocked down, or incautiously loiter on a crossing,
the street-orderly rescues them from peril or
death; or warns them of the approaching danger
of carriages driving in opposite directions: if other
accidents befall pedestrians,&mdash;if they fall on the
pavement, from sudden illness, faintness, or apoplexy,
the street-orderly is at hand to render
assistance, or convey them to the nearest surgery
or hospital. If strangers are at fault as to the
localities of London, or the place of their destination,
the orderly, in a civil and respectful manner,
directs them on their way. If habitual or professional
mendicants are importunate or troublesome,
the street-orderly warns them off; or hands
them to the care of the policeman. And if a
<i>really</i> poor or starving fellow-creature wanders in
search of food or alms, he leads him to a workhouse
or soup-kitchen<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>“<i>Should the system become general (of which
there is now every good prospect), it will be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
means of rescuing no less than</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">TEN THOUSAND
PERSONS</span> <i>and their families from destitution and
distress</i> (in London alone);&mdash;from the forlorn
and wretched condition which tempts to criminality
and outrage, to that of comfort, independence,
and happiness&mdash;produced by their own industry,
aided by the kind consideration of those
who are more the favourites of fortune than
themselves.</p>

<p>“In conclusion it may be stated, that the
street-orderly system will keep the streets and
pavements of London and Westminster as clean
as the court-yard and hall of any gentleman’s
private dwelling: it will not only secure the
general comfort and health of upwards of two
millions of people, but save a vast annual amount
to shopkeepers, housekeepers, and others, with
regard to the spoiling of their goods by dust and
dirt; in the wear and tear of clothes and furniture,
by an eternal round of brushing, dusting,
scouring, and scrubbing.”</p>

<p>The foregoing extract fully indicates the system
pursued and results of street-orderlyism. I will
now deal with what may be considered <i>the labour
or trade part of the question</i>.</p>

<p>By the street-orderly plan a district is duly
apportioned. To one man is assigned the care of
a series of courts, a street, or 500, 1000, 1200,
1500, or 2000 yards of a public way, according
to its traffic, after the whole surface has been
swept “the first thing in the morning.” In
Oxford-street, for instance, it has been estimated
that 500 yards can be kept clear of the dirt continually
being deposited by one man; in the
squares, where there is no great traffic, 2000 yards;
while in so busy a part as Cheapside, some nine
men will be required to be hourly on the look-out.
These street-orderlies are confined to their beats as
strictly as are policeman, and as they soon become
known to the inhabitants, it is a means of checking
any disposition to loiter, or to shirk the work;
to say nothing of the corps of inspectors and superintendents.</p>

<p>The <i>division of labour</i> among the street-orderlies
is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The <i>foreman</i>, whose duty is to “look over
the men” (one such over-looker being employed to
about every 20 men), and who receives 15<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p>2. The <i>barrow-men</i>, or sweepers, consisting of
men and boys; the former receiving 12<i>s.</i> and the
latter generally 7<i>s.</i> per week.</p>

<p>The <i>tools and implements</i> used, and their cost,
are as follows:&mdash;wooden scoops, to throw up the
slop, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> each (they used to be made of iron,
weighing 8 lbs. each, but the men then complained
that the weight “broke their arms”); shovel,
2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; hoe and scraper, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; hand-broom,
8<i>d.</i>; scavager’s broom, 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; barrow, 12<i>s.</i>;
covered barrow, 24<i>s.</i></p>

<p>In the amount of his receipts, the street-orderly
appears to a disadvantage, as many of
the “regular hands” of the contractors receive
16<i>s.</i> weekly, and he but 12<i>s.</i> The reason
for this circumscribed payment I have already
alluded to&mdash;the deficiency of funds to carry out
the full purposes of the Association. Contrasted
with the remuneration of the great majority of
the pauper scavagers, the street-orderly is in a
state of comparative comfort, for he receives nearly
double as much as the Guardians of the Poor of
Chelsea and the Liberty of the Rolls pay their
labourers, and full 25 per cent. more than is paid by
Bermondsey, Deptford, Marylebone, St. James’s,
Westminster, St. George’s, Hanover-square, and
St. Andrew’s, Holborn; and, I am assured, it is
the intention of the Council to pay the full rate of
wages given by the more respectable scavagers,
viz., 16<i>s.</i> a week each man. <i>If traders can do
this, philanthropists, who require no profit, at
least should be equally liberal.</i> The labourer
never can be benefited by depreciating the ordinary
wages of his trade; and I must in justice confess,
that there are scattered throughout the Report
repeated regrets that the funds of the Association
will not admit of a higher rate of wages being paid.</p>

<p>The street-orderly is not subjected to any fines
or drawbacks, and is paid always in money, every
Saturday evening at the office of the Association.
In this respect, however, he does not differ from
other bodies of scavagers.</p>

<p>The usual mode of obtaining employment among
the street-orderlies is by personal application at
the office of the Association in Leicester-square;
but sometimes letters, well-penned and well-worded,
are addressed to the president.</p>

<p>The daily number of applicants for employment
is far from demonstrative of that unbroken prosperity
of the country, of which we hear so much.
On my inquiring into the number, I ascertained
towards the end of August, that, for the previous
fortnight, during fine summer weather, London
being still full of the visitors to the Exhibition,
on an average 30 men, of nearly all conditions
of life, applied personally each day for work at
street-sweeping, at 12<i>s.</i> a week. Certainly this
labour is not connected with the feeling of pauper
degradation, but it does not look well for the country
that in twelve days 360 men should apply for such
work. On the year’s average, I am assured,
there are 30 applications daily, but only ten new
applicants, as men call to solicit an engagement
again and again. Thus in the year there are
<i>nine thousand, three hundred, and ninety</i> applications,
and 3130 individual applicants. In
the course of one month last winter, there were
applications from 300 boys in Spitalfields alone,
to be set to work; and I am told, that had
they been successful, 3000 lads would have applied
the next month.</p>

<p>When an application is made by any one recommended
by subscribers, &amp;c., to the Association,
or where the case seems worthy of attention, the
names and addresses are entered in a book, with
a slight sketch of the circumstances of the person
wishing to become a street-orderly, so that inquiries
may be made. I give a few of the more recent
of these entries and descriptions, which are really
“histories in little”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thomas M’G&mdash;&mdash;, aged 50, W&mdash; L&mdash; street,
Chelsea Hospital, single man. Taught a French
and English school in Lyons, France. Driven out
of France at the Revolution of 1848. Penniless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rich. <span class="lock">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>, 13, <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> street, <span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> garden,
42 years. Married. Can read and write. Has
been a seaman in the royal service ten years.
Chairmaker by trade. Has jobbed as a porter in
Rochester, Kent.</p>

<p>“Phil. <span class="lock">S&mdash;&mdash;</span>, 1, R&mdash; L&mdash; street, High Holborn.
From Killarney, co. Kerry. Bred a
gardener. Fifteen years in constabulary force,
for which he has a character from Col. Macgregor,
and received the compensation of 50<i>l.</i>, which he
bestowed on his father and mother to keep them
at home. Nine months in England, viz., in
Bristol, Bath, and London. Aged 35. Can read
and write.</p>

<p>“Edw. <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span>, 79, <span class="lock">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> street, Hackney.
Aged 27. Married. Army-pensioner, 6<i>d.</i> a day.
Can read and write. Recommended by Rev. T.
Gibson, rector of Hackney.</p>

<p>“Chas. <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span>, 11, <span class="lock">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> street, Chelsea.
Aged 38. Gentleman’s servant.”</p>

<p>In my account of the “regular hands” employed
by the contracting scavagers, I have stated
that the street-orderlies were a more miscellaneous
body, as they had not been reared in the same
proportion to street work. They are also, I may
add, a better-conducted and better-informed class
than the general run of unskilled labourers, as
they know, before applying for street-orderly
work, that inquiries are made concerning them,
and that men of reprobate character will not be
employed.</p>

<p>Many of those employed as orderlies have
since returned to their original employments;
others have procured, and been recommended to,
superior situations in life to that of street-orderlies,
by the Council of the Association, but
<i>no instance has occurred of any street-orderly
having returned back to his parish workhouse
or stoneyard</i>. This certainly looks well.</p>

<p>One street-orderly, I may add, is now a reputable
school-master, and has been so for some
time; another is a clerk under similar circumstances.
Another is a good theoretical and practical
musician, having officiated as organist in
churches and at concerts; he is also a neat music
copyist. Another tells of his correspondence with
a bishop on theological topics. Another, with a
long and well-cultured beard, has been a model
for artists. One had 150<i>l.</i> left to him not long
ago, which was soon spent; his wife spent it, he
said, and then he quietly applied to be permitted
to be again a street-orderly. Several have got
engagements as seamen, their original calling&mdash;indeed,
I am assured, that a few months of street-orderly
labour is looked upon as an excellent
ordeal of character, after which the Association
affirms good behaviour on the part of the employed.</p>

<p>The subscribers to the funds not unfrequently
recommend destitute persons to the good offices of
the Association, apart from their employment as
street-orderlies. Thus, it is only a few weeks
ago, that twelve Spanish refugees, none of them
speaking English, were recommended to the Association;
one of them it was ultimately enabled to
establish as a waiter in an hotel resorted to by
foreigners, another as an interpreter, another as a
gentleman’s servant, and another (with a little
boy, his son) in shoe-blacking in Leicester-square.</p>

<p>Thus among street-orderlies are to be found a
great diversity of career in life, and what may be
called adventures.</p>

<p>One great advantage, however, which the orderly
possesses over his better paid brethren is in the
greater probability of his “rising out of the
street.” This is very rarely the case with an
ordinary scavager.</p>

<p>I now give the following account from one of
the street-orderlies, a tall, soldierly-looking <span class="lock">man:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’m 42 now,” he said, “and when I was a
boy and a young man I was employed in the
<i>Times</i> machine office, but got into a bit of a row&mdash;a
bit of a street quarrel and frolic, and was
called on to pay 3<i>l.</i>, something about a street-lamp:
that was out of the question; and as I was
taking a walk in the park, not just knowing what
I’d best do, I met a recruiting sergeant, and enlisted
on a sudden&mdash;all on a sudden&mdash;in the 16th
Lancers. When I came to the standard, though,
I was found a little bit too short. Well, I was
rather frolicsome in those days, I confess, and
perhaps <i>had rather a turn for a roving life</i>, so
when the sergeant said he’d take me to the East
India Company’s recruiting sergeant, I consented,
and was accepted at once. I was taken to Calcutta,
and served under General Nott all through
the Affghan war. I was in the East India Company’s
artillery, 4th company and 2nd battalion.
Why, yes, sir, I saw a little of what you may call
‘service.’ I was at the fighting at Candahar,
Bowlinglen, Bowling-pass, Clatigillsy, Ghuznee,
and Caboul. The first real warm work I was in
was at Candahar. I’ve heard young soldiers say
that they’ve gone into action the first time as
merry as they would go to a play. Don’t believe
them, sir. Old soldiers will tell you quite different.
You <i>must</i> feel queer and serious the first
time you’re in action: it’s not fear&mdash;it’s nervousness.
The crack of the muskets at the first
fire you hear in real hard earnest is uncommon
startling; you see the flash of the fire from the
enemy’s line, but very little else. Indeed, oft
enough you see nothing but smoke, and hear nothing
but balls whistling every side of you. And
then you get excited, just as if you were at a
hunt; but after a little service&mdash;I can speak for
myself, at any rate&mdash;you go into action as you
go to your dinner.</p>

Affghanistan retreat; when the 44th was completely
cut up, before any help could get up to
them. We suffered a good deal from want of
sufficient food; but it was nothing like so bad, at
the very worst, as if you’re suffering in London.
In India, in that war time, if you suffered, you
were along with a number in just the same boat
as yourself; and there’s always something to
hope for when you’re an army. It’s different
if you’re walking the streets of London by yourself&mdash;I
felt it, sir, for a little bit after my return&mdash;and
if you haven’t a penny, you feel as if there
wasn’t a hope. If you have friends it may be
different, but I had none. It’s no comfort if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
you know hundreds are suffering as you are, for
you can’t help and cheer one another as soldiers
can.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, as I’ve told you, I saw a good deal
of service all through that war. Indeed I served
thirteen years and four months, and was then
discharged on account of ill health. If I’d served
eight months longer that would have been fourteen
years, and I should have been entitled to a pension.
I believe my illness was caused by the
hardships I went through in the campaigns, fighting
and killing men that I never saw before, and
until I was in India had never heard of, and that
I had no ill-will to; certainly not, why should I?
they never did me any wrong. But when it
comes to war, if you can’t kill them they’ll kill
you. When I got back to London I applied at
the East India House for a pension, but was
refused. I hadn’t served my time, though that
wasn’t my fault.</p>

<p>“I then applied for work in the <i>Times</i> machine
office, and they were kind enough to put me on.
But I wasn’t master of the work, for there was
new machinery, wonderful machinery, and a many
changes. So I couldn’t be kept on, and was
some time out of work, and very badly off, as
I’ve said before, and then I got work as a scavenger.
O, I knew nothing about sweeping before
that. I’d never swept anything except the snow
in the north of India, which is quite a different
sort of thing to London dirt. But I very soon
got into the way of it. I found no difficulty
about it, though some may pretend there is an
art in it. I had 15<i>s.</i> a week, and when I was
no longer wanted I got employment as a street-orderly.
I never was married, and have only
myself to provide for. I’m satisfied that the
street-orderly is far the best plan for street-cleaning.
Nothing else can touch it, in my opinion,
and I thought so before I was one of them, and
I believe most working scavengers think so now,
though they mayn’t like to say so, for fear it might
go again their interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m sometimes questioned by
gentlemen that may be passing in the streets
while I’m at work, all about our system. They
generally say, ‘and a very good system,
too.’ One said once, ‘It shows that scavengers
can be decent men; they weren’t when I was
first in London, above 40 years ago.’ Well, I
sometimes get the price of a pint of beer given to
me by gentlemen making inquiries, but very
seldom.”</p>

<p>Until about eighteen months ago none but unmarried
men were employed by the Association,
and these all resided in one locality, and under
one general superintendence or system. The
boarding and lodging of the men has, however,
been discontinued about fifteen months; for I am told
it was found difficult to encourage industrial and
self-reliant pursuits in connection with public eleemosynary
aid. Married men are now employed,
and all the street-orderlies reside at their own
homes; the adults, married or single, receiving
12<i>s.</i> a week each; the boys, 6<i>s.</i>; while to each
man is gratuitously supplied a blouse of blue
serge, costing 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a glazed hat, costing
the same amount.</p>

<p>The system formerly adopted was as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The men were formed into a distinct body, and
established in houses taken for them in Ham-yard,
Great Windmill-street, Haymarket.</p>

<p>“The wages of the men,” states the Report,
“were fixed at 12<i>s.</i> each per week; that is, 9<i>s.</i>
were charged for board and lodging, and 3<i>s.</i> were
paid in money to each man on Saturday afternoon,
out of which he was expected to pay for his
clothing and washing. The men had provided
for them clean wholesome beds and bedding, a
common sitting-room, with every means of ablution
and personal cleanliness, including a warm
bath once a week. Their food was abundant and
of the best quality, viz., coffee and bread and
butter for breakfast, at eight o’clock; round of
beef, bread, and vegetables, four times a week for
dinner, at one o’clock; nutritious soup and bread,
or bread and cheese, forming the afternoon repast
of the other three days. At six in the evening,
when they returned from their labours, they were
refreshed with tea or coffee, and bread and butter;
or for supper, at nine, each had a large basin of
soup, with bread. Thus, three-fourths of their
wages being laid out for them to advantage, the
men were well lodged and fed; and they have
always declared themselves satisfied, comfortable,
and happy, under the arrangements that were
made for them. Under the charge of their intelligent
and active superintendent, the street-orderlies
soon fell into a state of the most exact discipline
and order; and when old orderlies were
drafted off, either to enter the service of parish
boards who adopted the system, or were recommended
into service, or some other superior
position in life, and when new recruits came to
supply their places, the latter found no difficulty
in conforming to the rules laid down for the
performance of their duties, as well as for
their general conduct. ‘Military time’ regulated
their hours of labour, refreshment, and rest; due
attention was required from all; and each man
(though a scavenger) was expected to be cleanly
in his person, and respectful in his demeanour;
indeed, nothing could be more gratifying than the
conduct of these men, both at home and abroad.”</p>

<p>“In their domicile in Ham Yard,” continues
the Report, “the street-orderlies have invariably
been encouraged to follow pursuits which were
useful and improving, after their daily labours
were at an end; for this, a small library of history,
voyages, travels, and instructive and entertaining
periodical works, was placed at their disposal; and
it is truly gratifying to the Council to be able to
state, that the men evinced great satisfaction, and
even avidity, in availing themselves of this source
of intellectual pleasure and improvement. Writing
materials also were provided for them, for the
purpose of practice and improvement, as well as
for mutual instruction in this most necessary and
useful art; and it must be gratifying to the
members of the Association to be informed, that,
in April last, 34 out of 40 men appended their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
signatures, distinctly and well written, to a document
which was submitted to them. Such a fact
will at least prove, that when poor persons are employed,
well fed, and lodged, and cared for in the
way of instruction, they do not always mis-spend
their time, nor, from mere preference, run riot in
pot-houses and scenes of low debauchery. It is to
be borne in mind, however, that one-half of these
men were persons of almost every trade and occupation,
from the artizan to the shopman and clerk,
and therefore previously educated; the other half
consisted of labourers and persons forsaken and
indigent from their birth, and formerly dependent
on workhouse charity or chance employment for
their scanty subsistence; consequently in a state
of utter ignorance as to reading and writing.</p>

<p>“Every night, after supper, prayers were read
by the superintendent; and it has frequently been
a most edifying as well as gratifying sight to
members of your Council, as well as to other
persons of rank and station in society, who have
visited the Hospice in Ham Yard at that interesting
hour, to observe the decorum with which these
poor men demeaned themselves; and the heartfelt
solemnity with which they joined in the invocations
and thanks to their Creator and Preserver!</p>

<p>“Each Sunday morning, at 8 o’clock, a portion
of the church service was read, followed by an
extemporaneous discourse or exhortation by the
secretary to the Hospice. They were marshalled
to church twice on the Sabbath, headed by the
superintendent and foremen; and generally divided
into two or three bodies, each taking a direction
to St. James’s, St. Anne’s, or St. Paul’s, Covent
Garden; in all of which places of worship they
had sitting accommodation provided by the kindness
of the clergy and churchwardens. On Tuesday
evenings they had the benefit of receiving pastoral
visits and instruction from several of the worthy
clergymen of the surrounding parishes.”</p>

<p>This is all very benevolent, but still very
wrong. There is but one way of benefiting the
poor, viz., by developing their powers of self-reliance,
and certainly not in treating them like
children. Philanthropists always seek to do too
much, and in this is to be found the main cause of
their repeated failures. The poor are expected to
become angels in an instant, and the consequence
is, they are merely made <i>hypocrites</i>. Moreover,
no men of any independence of character will
submit to be washed, and dressed, and fed like
schoolboys; hence none but the worst classes
come to be experimented upon. It would seem,
too, that this overweening disposition to play
the part of <i>ped-agogues</i> (I use the word in its
literal sense) to the poor, proceeds rather from a
love of power than from a sincere regard for the
people. Let the rich become the advisers and
assistants of the poor, giving them the benefit of
their superior education and means&mdash;but <i>leaving
the people to act for themselves</i>&mdash;and they will do a
great good, developing in them a higher standard
of comfort and moral excellence, and so, by improving
their tastes, inducing a necessary change
in their habits. But such as seek merely to <i>lord
it</i> over those whom distress has placed in their
power, and strive to bring about the <i>villeinage</i> of
benevolence, making the people the philanthropic,
instead of the feudal, serfs of our nobles, should
be denounced as the arch-enemies of the country.
Such persons may mean well, but assuredly they
achieve the worst towards the poor. The curfew-bell,
whether instituted by benevolence or tyranny,
has the same degrading effect on the people&mdash;destroying
their principle of self-action, without
which we are all but as the beasts of the field.</p>

<p>Moreover, the laying out of the earnings of the
poor is sure, after a time, to sink into “a job;”
and I quote the above passage to show that, despite
the kindest management, eleemosynary help is <i>not</i>
a fitting adjunct to the industrial toil of independent
labourers.</p>

<p><i>The residences of the street-orderlies</i> are now in
all quarters where unfurnished rooms are about
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> a week. The addresses I have cited
show them residing in the outskirts and the heart
of the metropolis. The following returns, however,
will indicate the ages, the previous occupations,
the education, church-going, the personal
habits, diet, rent, &amp;c., of the class constituting the
street-orderlies, better than anything I can say
on the matter.</p>

<p>Before any man is employed as a street-orderly,
he is called upon to answer certain questions, and
the replies from 67 men to these questions supply
a fund of curious and important information&mdash;important
to all but those who account the lot of the
poor of <i>no</i> importance. In presenting these details,
I beg to express my obligations to Mr. Colin
Mackenzie, the enlightened and kindly secretary
of the Association.</p>

<p>I shall first show what is the order of the
questioning, then what were the answers, and I
shall afterwards recapitulate, with a few comments,
the salient characteristics of the whole.</p>

<p>The questions are after this fashion; the one I
adduce having been asked of a scavager to whom
a preference was <span class="lock">given:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The greatest number of any age was 7 persons
of 45 years respectively.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Their previous occupations had been</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>
22 labourers.<br />
3 at the business “all their lives.”<br />
3 dustmen.<br />
3 ostlers.<br />
2 stablemen.<br />
2 carmen.<br />
2 porters.<br />
2 gentlemen’s servants.<br />
2 greengrocers.<br />
1 following dust-cart.<br />
1 excavator.<br />
1 gravel digging.<br />
1 stone breaking in yards.<br />
1 at work in the brick-fields.<br />
1 at work in the lime-works.<br />
1 coal porter.<br />
1 sweep.<br />
1 haybinder.<br />
1 gaslighter.<br />
1 dairyman.<br />
1 ploughman.<br />
1 gardener.<br />
1 errand boy.<br />

1 fur dyer.<br />
1 skinner.<br />
1 leather-dresser.<br />
1 letter-press printer.<br />
1 paper stainer.<br />
1 glass blower.<br />
1 farrier.<br />
1 plasterer.<br />
1 clerk.<br />
1 vendor of goods.<br />
1 licensed victualler.<br />
</p>

<p>Therefore, of 67 scavagers</p>

<p>
12 had been artizans.<br />
55 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   „ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    unskilled workmen.<br />
</p>

<p>Hence about five-sixths belong to the unskilled
class of operatives.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Time of having been at scavagering.</i></p>

<p>
3 “all their lives” at the business.<br />
1 about 27 years.<br />
6 from 15 to 20 years.<br />
6  &nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp; 10 &nbsp;  „ &nbsp; 15 &nbsp;  „<br />

34  &nbsp; „  1 &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp; 5 &nbsp;  „<br />
13 twelve months and less.<br />
</p>

<p>Hence it would appear, that few have been at
the business a long time. The greater number
have not been acting as scavagers more than five
years.</p>


<p class="center"><i>State of education.&mdash;Could they read and write?</i></p>

<p>
45 answered yes.<br />
4 replied that they could read and write.<br />
5 could read only.<br />
12 could do neither.<br />
1 was deaf and dumb.<br />
</p>

<p>Hence it would appear, that rather more than
two-thirds of the scavagers have received <i>some
little</i> education.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Did they go to church or chapel?</i></p>

<p>
22 answered yes.<br />
9 went to church.<br />

4 &nbsp;&nbsp; „  &nbsp;&nbsp; the Catholic chapel.<br />
1 &nbsp;&nbsp; „  &nbsp;&nbsp; both church and chapel.<br />
5 went sometimes.<br />
1 not often.<br />
17 never went at all.<br />
1 was ashamed to go.<br />
1 went out of town to enjoy himself.<br />
2 made no return (1 being deaf and dumb).<br />
</p>

<p>Thus it would seem, that not quite two-thirds
regularly attend some place of worship;
that about one-eleventh go occasionally; and that
about one-fourth never go at all.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Why did they not go to church?</i></p>

<p>
12 had no clothes.<br />
55 returned no answer (1 being deaf and dumb).<br />
</p>

<p>Hence of those who never go (19 out of 67),
very nearly two-thirds (say 12 in 19) have no
clothes to appear in.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Did they bathe?</i></p>

<p>
59 answered no.<br />
3 replied yes.<br />
2 said they did in the Thames.<br />
2 returned “sometimes.”<br />
1 was deaf and dumb.<br />
</p>

<p>Hence it appeared, that about seven-eighths
never bathe, although following the filthiest occupation.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Were they married or single?</i></p>

<p>
56 were married.<br />
5  &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp; widowers.<br />
6  &nbsp;&nbsp; „ &nbsp;&nbsp; single.<br />
</p>

<p>Thus it would seem, that about ten-elevenths
are or have been married men.</p>

<p>Consequently 51 out of 61, or five-sixths, are
married, and have families numbering altogether
165 children; the majority had only 3 children,
and this was about the average family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><i>What were the ages of their children?</i></p>

<p>
11 were grown up.<br />
2 between 30 and 40.<br />
9  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  „  &nbsp;&nbsp;  20 and 30.<br />
49  &nbsp;&nbsp;  „  &nbsp;&nbsp;  10 and 20.<br />
80  &nbsp;&nbsp;  „  &nbsp;&nbsp;   1 and 10.<br />
8 were 1 year and under.<br />
5 were returned at home.<br />
1 returned as dead.<br />
</p>

<p>One-half of the scavagers’ children, therefore, are
between 1 and 10 years of age; the majority
would appear to be 8 years old.</p>

<p>Some were said to be grown up, but no number
was given.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Did their children go to school?</i></p>

<p>
13 answered yes.<br />
13 to the National School.<br />
5 to the Ragged School.<br />
2 to Catholic.<br />
2 to Parish.<br />
6 to local schools.<br />
1 replied that he went sometimes.<br />
2 returned no.<br />
1 replied that his children were “not with him.”<br />
22 (of whom 16 had no children, and 1 was deaf and dumb) made no reply.<br />
</p>

<p>From this it would seem, that a large majority&mdash;41
out of 51, or four-fifths&mdash;of the parents who
have children send them to school.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Did their wives work?</i></p>

<p>
15 returned no.<br />
6 said their wives were “unable.”<br />
1 had lost the use of her limbs.<br />
2 did, but “not often.”<br />
4 did “when they could.”<br />
10 worked “sometimes.”<br />
12 answered yes.<br />
1 sold cresses.<br />
15 made no return (11 having no wives and 1 being deaf and dumb).<br />
</p>

<p>Hence two-fifths of the wives (22 out of 56) do
no work, 16 do so occasionally, and 13, or one-fourth,
are in the habit of working.</p>


<p class="center"><i>What were wives’ earnings?</i></p>

<p>
10 returned them as “uncertain.”<br />
1 “didn’t know.”<br />
1 estimated them at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week.<br />
1 at 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>                 „<br />
2 at 2<i>s.</i>                               „<br />
3 at 2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i>                 „<br />
2 at about 3<i>s.</i>                         „<br />
1 at 2<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>                 „<br />
1 at 3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i>                 „<br />
1 at 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> per day.<br />
43 gave no returns (having either no wives, or their wives not working).<br />
1 was deaf and dumb.<br />
</p>

<p>So that, out of 29 wives who were said to
work, 16 occasionally and 13 regularly, there were
returns for 23. Nearly half of their earnings were
given as uncertain from their seldom doing work,
while the remainder were stated to gain from 1<i>s.</i>
to 4<i>s.</i> per week; about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> perhaps would be
a fair average.</p>

<p>Hence it is evident, that one-half receive 15<i>s.</i>
or more a week, and about a fourth 9<i>s.</i></p>

<p>It was not the parishes, however, but the contractors
with the parishes, who paid the higher
rates of wages: Mr. Dodd, for St. Luke’s; Mr.
Westley, for St. Botolph’s, Bishopsgate; Mr.
Parsons, for Whitechapel; Mr. Newman, for
Bethnal-green, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These wages the scavagers laid out in the
following <span class="lock">manner:&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="center"><i>For rent, per week.</i></p>

1 lived rent free.<br />
1 paid for board and lodging.<br />
1 lived with mother.<br />
</p>

<p>Hence it would appear, that near upon half the
number paid 2<i>s.</i> rent. The usual rent paid seems
to be between 2<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i>, five-sixths of the entire
number paying one or other of those amounts.
Only three lived in furnished lodgings, and the
rents of these were, respectively, two at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
and the other at 2<i>s.</i></p>

4 two loaves a day from parish.<br />
3 gave a certain sum per week to their wives or mothers to lay out for them, and 1 boarded and lodged.<br />
1 was deaf and dumb.<br />
</p>

<p>Thus it would seem, that the general sum
expended weekly on bread varies between 2<i>s.</i> and
4<i>s.</i> The average saving from free-trade, therefore,
would be between 4<i>d.</i> and 8<i>d.</i>, or say 6<i>d.</i>, per week.</p>

1 once a week.<br />
4 had none.<br />
5 no returns (3 of this number gave a weekly allowance to wives or mothers, 1 was deaf and dumb, and 1 paid for board and lodging).<br />
</p>

<p>By the above we see, that the sum usually expended
on meat is between 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> per
week, about one-third of the entire number expending
that sum. All those who expended 1<i>s.</i>
and less per week had 9<i>s.</i> and less for their week’s
labour. The average saving from the cheapening
of provisions would here appear to be between
5<i>d.</i> and 6<i>d.</i> per week at the outside.</p>

</p>

<p>Thus the greater proportion (five-sixths), it will
be seen, had no relief; two of those who had relief
received 9<i>s.</i> wages a week, and two others
only 7<i>s.</i>, while four received part of their wages
from the parish in bread.</p>

<p>These analyses are not merely the characteristics
of the applicant or existent street-orderlies;
they are really the annals of the poor in all that
relates to their domestic management in regard to
meat and clothes, the care of their children, their
church-going, education, previous callings, and
parish relief. The inquiry is not discouraging as
to the character of the poor, and I must call
attention to the circumstance of how rarely it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
that so large a collection of facts is placed at
the command of a public writer. In many of
the public offices the simplest information is as
jealously withheld as if statistical knowledge
were the first and last steps to high treason.
I trust that Mr. Cochrane’s example in the skilful
arrangement of the returns connected with the
Association over which he presides, and his
courteous readiness to supply the information,
gained at no small care and cost, will be more
freely followed, as such a course unquestionably
tends to the public benefit.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these statements, how hard
the struggle often is to obtain work in unskilled
labour, and, when obtained, how bare the living.
Every farthing earned by such workpeople is
necessarily expended in the support of a family;
and in the foregoing details we have another proof
as to the diminution of the purchasing fund of
the country, being in direct proportion to the
diminution of the wages. If 100 men receive but
7<i>s.</i> a week each for their work, their yearly outlay,
to “keep the bare life in them,” is 1820<i>l.</i> If they
are paid 16<i>s.</i> a week, their outlay is 4160<i>l.</i>; an expenditure
of 2340<i>l.</i> more in the productions of
our manufactures, in all textile, metal, or wooden
fabrics; in bread, meat, fruit, or vegetables; and
in the now necessaries, the grand staple of our
foreign and colonial trade&mdash;tea, coffee, cocoa,
sugar, rice, and tobacco. <i>Increase your wages,
therefore, and you increase your markets.</i> For
manufacturers to underpay their workmen is to
cripple the demand for manufactures. To talk
of the over-production of our cotton, linen, and
woollen goods is idle, when thousands of men
engaged in such productions are in rags. It is
not that there are too many makers, but too few
who, owing to the decrease of wages, are able
to be buyers. Let it be remembered that, out of
67 labouring men, three-fourths could not afford to
buy proper clothing, expending thereupon “little”
or “nothing,” and, I may add, <i>because</i> earning
little or nothing, and so having scarcely anything
to expend.</p>

<p>I now come to <i>the cost of cleansing the streets
upon the street-orderly system</i>, as compared with that
of the ordinary modes of payment to contractors,
&amp;c. It will have been observed, from what has
been previously stated, that the Council of the
Association contend that far higher amounts may
be realized for street manure when collected clean,
according to the street-orderly plan. If, by a better
mode of collecting the street dirt, it be kept unmixed,
its increase in value and in price may be
most positively affirmed.</p>

<p>Before presenting estimates and calculations of
cost, I may remind the reader that, under the
street-orderly system, no watering carts are required,
and none are used where the system is
carried out in its integrity. To be able to dispense
with the watering of the streets is not merely to
get rid of a great nuisance, but to effect a considerable
saving in the rates.</p>

<p>I now give two estimates, both relating to the
same <span class="lock">district:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Obs.&mdash;The sum of 800<i>l.</i> per annum was paid
to the contractor on account of expenses incurred
for the removal of slop. During the three years
previous to 1849, the contractor paid money to
the parish for permission to remove the house-ashes,
the value of which was then 2<i>s.</i> per load;
it is now 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In St. Giles’s and St. George’s
parishes, whose surface is more than twice the
extent of St. James’s, the expense of slop-cartage,
in 1850, was 304<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, whilst the sum received
for cattle-manure collected by street-orderlies,
was 73<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; and the slop-expenses
for the four months ending November 29, were
59<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, whilst the manure sold for 21<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>
Thus has the slop-expense in these extensive
united parishes been reduced to less than 120<i>l.</i>
per annum. Since the preceding estimate was
submitted to the Commissioners of Paving, the
street-orderly system has been introduced into
St. James’s parish; and it is confidently expected
that the ‘Annual Prospective saving’ of 938<i>l.</i>,
will be fully realised.”</p>

<p>A similar estimate has just been sent into the
authorities of the great parish of St. Marylebone,
but its results do not differ from the one I have
just cited.</p>

<p>I next present an estimate contrasting the expense
of the street-orderly method with the cost

<p>Two estimates, then, show an expectation of a
yearly saving of no less than 2320<i>l.</i> to the rate-payers
of two parishes alone; 938<i>l.</i> to St. James’s,
and 1382<i>l.</i> to St. Martin’s. And this, too, if all
that be augured of this system be realized, with a
freedom from street dust and dirt unknown under
other methods of scavagery. I think it right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
however, to express my opinion that even in
the reasonable prospect of these great savings
being effected, it is a paltry, or rather a false,
because miscalled, economy to speculate on the
payment of 10<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i> a week to street-labourers
in the parishes of St. James and St.
Martin respectively, when so many of the contractors
pay their men 16<i>s.</i> weekly. If this
low hire be justifiable in the way of an experiment,
it can never be justifiable as a continuance
of the <i>reward</i> of labour.</p>

<p>If the street-orderly system is to be the means
of <i>permanently</i> reducing the wages of the regular
scavagers from 16<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a week, then we had
better remain afflicted with the physical dirt of
our streets, than the moral filth which is sure to
proceed from the poverty of our people&mdash;but if it
is to be a means of elevating the pauper to the
dignity of the independent labour, rather than
dragging the independent labourer down to the
debasement of the pauper, then let all who wish
well to their fellows encourage it as heartily and
strenuously as they can&mdash;otherwise the sooner it
is denounced as an insidious mode of defrauding
the poor of one-fourth of their earnings the
better; and it is merely in the belief that Mr.
Cochrane and the Council of the Association <i>mean</i>
to keep faith with the public and increase the
men’s wages to those of the regular trade, that
the street-orderly system is advocated here. If
our philanthropists are to reduce wages 25 per
cent., then, indeed, the poor man may cry, “<i>save
me from my friends</i>.”</p>

<p>As to the positive and definite working of the
street-orderly system as an <i>economical</i> system,
no information can be given beyond the estimates
I have cited, as it has never been duly tested on a
sufficiently large scale. Its working has been, of
necessity, desultory. It has, however, been introduced
into St. George’s, Bloomsbury; St. James’s,
Westminster; and is about to be established in
St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields; and in the course of a
year or two it seems that it will be sufficiently
tested. That its working has hitherto been desultory
is a necessity in London, where “vested
interests” look grimly on any change or even any
inquiry. That it deserves a full and liberal testing
seems undeniable, from the concurrent assent of
all parishioners who have turned their attention
to it.</p>

<p>It remains to show the expenses of the Philanthropic
Association, for I am unable to present an
account of street-orderlyism separately. The
two following tables fully indicate to what an extent
the association is indebted to the private purse of
Mr. Cochrane, who by this time has advanced
between 6000<i>l.</i> and 7000<i>l.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Street-Orderlies.&mdash;City Surveyor’s
Report.</span></h3>

<p>I have been favoured with a Report “upon street-cleansing
and in reference to the Street-Orderly
System,” by the author, Mr. W. Haywood, the
Surveyor to the City Commission of Sewers,
who has invited my attention to the matter, in
consequence of the statements which have appeared
on the subject in “London Labour and the
London Poor.”</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood, whose tone of argument is
courteous and moderate, and who does not scruple
to do justice to what he accounts the good points
of the street-orderly system, although he condemns
it as a whole, gives an account of the
earlier scavaging of the city, not differing in any
material respect from that which I have already
printed. He represents the public ways of the
City, which I have stated to be about 50 miles, as
“about 51 miles lineal, about 770,157 superficial
yards in area.” This area, it appears, comprehends
1000 different places.</p>

<p>In 1845 the area of the carriage-way of the
City was estimated at 418,000 square yards, and
the footway at 316,000, making a total of
734,000; but since that period new streets have
been made and others extensively widened. The
precincts of Bridewell, St. Bartholomew, St.
James’s, Duke’s-place, Aldgate, and others, have
been added to the jurisdiction of the Sewers Commission
by Act of Parliament, so that the Surveyor
now estimates the area of the carriage-way of the
City of London at 441,250 square yards, and the
footway at 328,907, making a total of 770,157
square yards.</p>

<p>“I am fully impressed,” observes Mr. Haywood,
“with the great importance to a densely-populated
city of an efficient cleansing of the public
ways. Probably after a perfect system of sewage
and drainage (which implies an adequate water
supply), and a well-paved surface (which I have
always considered to be little inferior in its importance
to the former, and which is indispensable
to obtaining clean sweeping), good surface
cleansing ranks next in its beneficial sanitary
influence; and most certainly the comfort gained
by all through having public thoroughfares in a
high degree of cleanliness is exceedingly great.”</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood expresses his opinion that streets
“ordure soddened”&mdash;smelling like “stable yards,”&mdash;dangerous
to the health of the inhabitants&mdash;impassable
from mud in winter and from dust in
summer&mdash;and inflicting constant pecuniary loss,
“can only exist in an appreciable degree in
thoroughfares swept much less frequently” than
the streets within the jurisdiction of the City
Commissioners of Sewers. In this opinion, however,
Mr. Haywood comes into direct collision
with the statements put forth by the Board of
Health, who have insisted upon the insanitary
state of the metropolitan streets, more strongly,
perhaps, in their several Reports, than has Mr.
Cochrane.</p>

<p>But Mr. Haywood believes that not only are
the assertions of the Board of Health as to the
unwholesome state of the metropolitan thoroughfares
unfounded as regards the city of London,
but he asserts that from the daily street-sweeping,
“the surface there is maintained in as high an
average condition of cleanliness, as the means
hitherto adopted will enable to be attained.”</p>

<p>“Nor does this apply,” says Mr. Haywood, “to
the main thoroughfares only. In the poorer courts
and alleys within the city, where a high degree
of cleanliness is, at least, as needful, in a sanitary
point of view, as in the larger and wider thoroughfares,
the facilities for efficient sweeping are as
great, if not greater, than in other portions of
your jurisdiction. For many years past the whole
of the courts and alleys which carts do not enter,
have been paved with flagstone, laid at a good
inclination, and presenting an uniform smooth
<i>non-absorbent</i> surface: in many of these courts
where the habits of the people are cleanly, the
scavenger’s broom is almost unneeded for weeks
together; in others, where the habit prevails of
throwing the refuse of the houses upon the pavements,
the daily sweeping is highly essential; but
in all these courts the surface presents a condition
which renders good clean sweeping a comparatively
easy operation, that which is swept away
being mostly dry, or nearly so.”</p>

<p>After alluding to the street-orderly principle of
scavaging, “to clean and keep clean,” Mr. Haywood
observes, “between the ‘<i>street-orderly system</i>’
and the periodical or intermittent sweeping there
is this difference, that upon the former system
there should be (if it fulfils what it professes) no
deposit of any description allowed to remain
much longer than a few minutes upon the surface,
and that there should be neither mud in the wet
weather, nor dust in the dry weather, upon the
public ways; whilst, upon the latter system, the
deposit necessarily accumulates between the periods
of sweeping, commencing as soon as one sweeping
has terminated, gradually increasing, and being at
its point of extreme accumulation at the period
when the next sweeping takes place; the former,
then, is, or should be, a system of prevention;
the latter, confessedly, but a system of palliation
or cure.</p>

<p>“The more frequent the periodical sweeping,
therefore, the nearer it approximates in its results
to the ‘<i>street-orderly system</i>,’ inasmuch as the
accumulations, being frequently removed, must be
smaller, and the evils of mud, dust, effluvia, &amp;c.,
less in proportion.</p>

<p>“Now to fulfil its promise: upon the ‘street-orderly
system,’ there should be men both day
and night within the streets, who should constantly
remove the manure and refuse, and, failing
this, if there be only cessation for six hours
out of the twenty-four of the ‘continuous cleansing,’
it becomes at once a periodical cleansing but
a degree in advance of the daily sweeping, which
has been now for years in operation within the
city of London.”</p>

<p>This appears to me to be an extreme conclusion:&mdash;because
the labours of the street-orderly system
cease when the great traffic ceases, and when, of
course, there is comparatively little or no dirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
deposited in the thoroughfares, therefore, says
Mr. Haywood, “the City system of cleansing once
per day is <i>only a degree</i> behind that system of
which the principle is incessant cleansing at such
time as the dirtying is incessant.” The two principles
are surely as different as light and darkness:&mdash;in
the one the cleansing is intermittent and the
dirt constant; in the other the dirt is intermittent
and the cleanliness constant&mdash;constant, at least,
so long as the causes of impurity are so.</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood, however, states that the Commissioners
were so pleased with the appearance of
the streets, when cleansed on the street-orderly
system, which “was <i>certainly much to be admired</i>,”
that they introduced a somewhat similar
system, calling their scavagers “daymen,” as they
had the care of <i>keeping</i> the streets clean, <i>after</i> a
daily morning sweeping by the contractor’s men.
They commenced their work at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> and ceased
at 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> in the summer months, and at half-past
4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> in the winter. In the summer months
36 daymen were employed on the average; in
the winter months, 46. The highest number of
scavaging daymen employed on any one day was
63; the lowest was 34. The area cleansed was
about 47,000 yards (superficial measure), and with
the following results, and the following cost, from
June 24, 1846, to the same date, <span class="lock">1847:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The daily sweeping,” Mr. Haywood says,
“which for the previous two years had been established
throughout the City, gave at that time
<i>very great satisfaction</i>. It was quite true that the
streets which the daymen attended to, <i>looked superior</i>
to those cleansed only <i>periodically</i>, but
the practical value of the difference was considered
by many not to be worth the sum of money
paid for it. It was also felt that, if it was continued,
it should upon principle be extended at least
to all streets of similar traffic to those upon which
it had been tried; and as, after due consideration,
the Commission thought that one daily sweeping
was sufficient, both for health and comfort, the
day or continuous sweeping was abandoned, and
the whole City only received, from that time to
the present, the usual daily sweeping.”</p>

<p>The “present” time is shown by the date of
Mr. Haywood’s Report, October 13, 1851. The
reason assigned for the abandonment of the system
of the daymen is peculiar and characteristic.
The system of continuous cleansing gave very
great satisfaction, although it was but a degree in
advance of the once-a-day cleansing. The streets
which the daymen attended to “looked,” and of
course were, “superior” in cleanliness to those
scavaged periodically. It was also felt that the
principle should “be extended at least to all
streets of similar traffic;” and why was it not so
extended? Because, in a word, “it was not
worth the money;” though by what standard the
value of public cleanliness was calculated, is not
mentioned.</p>

<p>The main question, therefore, is, what is the
difference in the cost of the two systems, and <i>is</i>
the admitted “superior cleanliness” produced by
the continuous mode of scavaging, in comparison
with that obtained by the intermittent mode, of
sufficient public value to warrant the increased
expense (if any)&mdash;in a word, as the City people
say&mdash;is it <i>worth the money</i>?</p>

<p>First, as to the comparative cost of the two
systems: after a statement of the contracts for
the dusting and cleansing of the City (matters
I have before treated of) Mr. Haywood, for the
purpose of making a comparison of the present
City system of scavaging with the street-orderly
system, gives the table in the opposite page to
show the cost of street cleansing and dusting
within the jurisdiction of the City Court of Sewers.</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood then invites attention to the subjoined
statement of the National Philanthropic
Association, on the occurrence of a demonstration
as to the efficiency and economy of the street-orderly
system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;From 24th June, 1846, to 24th June, 1847, the Commission made their own experiment upon the Street-Orderly
System&mdash;the expenses of such experiment are included in the above amounts. In 1849 the area of the
jurisdiction of the Commission was increased by the addition of various precincts under the City of London
Sewers’ Act.</p></div>

<p>“The total cost of the experiment was
£987 4<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, and, deducting the charges under
the head of advertising, Christmas dinner, and
petty cash expenses, and also that for office-rent,
clerks, messengers, &amp;c., and assigning £50 as the
value of the implements at that time for future
use, there is left a balance of £822 7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> as
the clear cost of the experiment.</p>

<p>“The experiment was tried for a period of
eight weeks exactly, according to the return made
to the Commission by the Superintendent of the
Association, but as in the statement of expenses
the wages appear to be included for a period of
nine weeks, I have assumed nine weeks as the
correct figure, and the experiment must therefore
have cost a sum of £822 7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for that period,
or at the rate of about £91 per week.</p>

<p>“To assign an expenditure in the same proportion
for the remaining 13-14ths of the whole carriage-way
area of the City would not be just, for,
in the first place, allowance must be made, owing to
the dirt brought off from the adjacent streets, which,
it is assumed, would not have been the case had they
also been cleansed upon the street-orderly system;
and moreover, as the majority of the streets
cleansed were those of large traffic, a larger proportion
of labour was needed to them than would
have been the case had the experiment been upon
any equal area of carriage-way, taken from a district
comprehending streets of all sizes and degrees
of traffic; but if I assume that the 1-14th
portion of the City cleansed represents 1-11th of
the whole in the labour needed for cleansing the
whole of the City upon the same system, I believe
I shall have made a very fair deduction,
and shall, if anything, err in favour of the experiment.</p>

<p>“Estimating, therefore, the expense of cleansing
the whole of the City carriage-way upon the
street-orderly system according to the expenses of
the experiment made in 1845-6, and from the
data then furnished, it appears that cleansing
upon such system would have come to an annual
sum of 52,052<i>l.</i></p>

<p>“It will be seen that there is a remarkable
difference between this estimate of 52,052<i>l.</i> per
annum and that of 18,000<i>l.</i> per annum estimated
by the Association, and given in their Report of
the 26th January, 1846; and what is more remarkable
is, that my estimate is framed not upon
any assumption of my own, but is a dry calculation
based upon the very figures of expense
furnished by the Association itself, and herein-before
recited.”</p>

<p>A second demonstration, carried on in the City
by the street-orderlies, is detailed by Mr. Haywood,
but as he draws the same conclusions from it,
there is no necessity to do other than allude to it
here.</p>

<p>According to the above estimate, it certainly
must be admitted that the difference between the
two accounts is, as Mr. Haywood says, “remarkable”&mdash;the
one being nearly three times more
than the other. But let us, for fairness’ sake, test
the cost of cleansing the City thoroughfares upon
the continuous plan of scavaging by the figures
given in Mr. Haywood’s own report, and see
whether the above conclusion is warranted by the
facts there stated. From June, 1846, to June,
1847, we have seen that several of the main
streets in the City were cleansed continuously
throughout the day by what were called “daymen”&mdash;that
is to say, 47,000 superficial yards of
the principal thoroughfares were <i>kept</i> clean (<i>after</i>
the daily cleansing of them by the contractor’s
men) by a body of men similar in their mode of
operation to the street-orderlies, and who removed
all the dirt as soon as deposited between the
hours of the principal traffic. The cost of this
experiment (for such it seems to have been)
was, for the twelve months, as we have seen,
1528<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> Now if the expense of cleansing
47,000 superficial yards upon the continuous
method was 1529<i>l.</i>, then, according to Cocker,
770,157 yards (the total area of the public ways
of the City) would cost 25,054<i>l.</i>; and, adding to
this 6328<i>l.</i> for the sum paid to the contractors
for the daily scavaging, we have only 31,382<i>l.</i>
for the gross expense of cleansing the whole of
the City thoroughfares once a day by the “regular
scavagers,” and <i>keeping</i> them clean <i>afterwards</i> by
a body similar to the street-orderlies&mdash;a difference
of upwards of 20,000<i>l.</i> between the facts and
figures of the City Surveyor.</p>

<p>It would appear to me, therefore, that Mr.
Haywood has erred, in estimating the probable
expense of the street-orderly system of scavaging
applied to the City at 52,000<i>l.</i> per annum, for, by
his own showing, it actually cost the authorities
for the one year when it was tried there, only
1529<i>l.</i> for 47,000 superficial yards, at which rate
770,000 yards could not cost more than 31,500<i>l.</i>,
and this, even allowing that the same amount
of labour would be required for the continuous
cleansing of the minor thoroughfares as was needed
for the principal ones. That the error is an oversight
on the part of the City Surveyor, the whole
tone of his Report is sufficient to assure us, for it
is at once moderate and candid.</p>

<p>It must, on the other hand, be admitted, that Mr.
Haywood is perfectly correct as to the difference
between the cost of the “demonstration” of the
street-orderly system of cleansing in the City, and
the estimated cost of that mode of scavaging
when brought into regular operation there; this,
however, the year’s experience of the City “daymen”
shows, could not possibly exceed 32,000<i>l.</i>,
and might and probably would be much less, when
we take into account the smaller quantity of labour
required for the minor thoroughfares&mdash;the extra
value of the street manure when collected free from
mud&mdash;the saving in the expense of watering the
streets (this not being required under the orderly
system)&mdash;and the abolition of the daily scavaging,
which is included in the sum above cited, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
which would be no longer needed were the
orderlies employed, such work being performed
by them at the commencement of their day’s
labours; so that I am disposed to believe, all things
considered, that somewhere about 20,000<i>l.</i> per
annum might be the gross expense of continuously
cleansing the City. Mr. Cochrane estimates it at
18,000<i>l.</i> But whether the admitted superior
cleanliness of the streets, and the employment of
an extra number of people, will be held by the
citizens to be worth the extra money, it is not for
me to say. If, however, the increased cleanliness
effected by the street-orderlies is to be brought
about by a decrease of the wages of the regular
scavagers from 16<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a week, which is the
amount upon which Mr. Cochrane forms his
estimate, then I do not hesitate to say the City
authorities will be gainers, in the matter of poor-rates
at least, by an adherence to the present
method of scavaging, paying as they do the best
wages, and indeed affording an illustrious example
to all the metropolitan parishes, in refusing
to grant contracts to any master scavagers but
such as consent to deal fairly with the men in their
employ. And I do hope and trust, for the sake of
the working-men, the City Commissioners of
Sewers will, should they decide upon having the
City cleansed <i>continuously</i>, make the same requirement
of Mr. Cochrane, before they allow his
street-orderlies to displace the regular scavagers
at present employed there.</p>

<p>Benefits to the community, gained at the expense
of “the people,” are really great evils. The
street-orderly system is a good one when applied
to parishes employing paupers and paying them
1<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> and a loaf per day, or even nothing, except
their food, for their labour. Here it elevates
paupers into independent labourers; but, applied
to those localities where the highest wages are
paid, and there is the greatest regard shown for the
welfare of the workmen, it is merely a scurf-system
of degrading the independent labourers to the
level of paupers, by reducing the wages of the
regular scavagers from 16<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> per week. The
avowed object of the street-orderly system is to
provide employment for able-bodied men, and so
to <i>prevent</i> them becoming a <i>burthen to the parish</i>.
But is not a reduction of the scavager’s wages
to the extent of 25 per cent. a week, more
likely to <i>encourage</i> than to <i>prevent</i> such a result?
This is the weak point of the orderly system, and
one which gentlemen calling themselves <i>philanthropists</i>
should really blush to be parties to.</p>

<p>After all, the opinion to which I am led is this&mdash;the
street-orderly system is incomparably the best
mode of scavaging, and the payment of the men by
“<i>honourable</i>” masters the best mode of employing
the scavagers. The evils of the scavaging trade
appear to me to spring chiefly from the parsimony
of the parish authorities&mdash;either employing their
own paupers without adequate remuneration, or
else paying such prices to the contractors as almost
necessitates the under-payment of the men in
their employ. Were I to fill a volume, this is all
that could be said on the matter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Jet and Hose” System of
Scavaging.</span></h3>

<p>There appears at the present time a bent in the
public mind for an improved system of scavagery.
Until the ravages of the cholera in 1832, and
again in 1848, roused the attention of Government
and of the country, men seemed satisfied to dwell
in dirty streets, and to congratulate themselves
that the public ways were dirtier in the days of
their fathers; a feeling or a spirit which has no
doubt existed in all cities, from the days of those
original scavagers, the vultures and hyenas of
Africa and the East, the adjutants of Calcutta,
and the hawks&mdash;the common glades or kites of
this country&mdash;and which, we are told, in the days
of Henry VIII. used to fly down among the
passengers to remove the offal of the butchers and
poulterers’ stalls in the metropolitan markets, and
in consideration of which services it was forbidden
to kill them&mdash;down to the mechanical sweeping
of the streets of London, and even to Mr.
Cochrane’s excellent street-orderlies.</p>

<p>Besides the plan suggested by Mr. Cochrane,
whose orderlies cleanse the streets without wetting,
and consequently without dirtying, the surface
by the use of the watering-cart, there is the
opposite method proposed by Mr. Lee, of Sheffield,
and other gentlemen, who recommend street-cleansing
by the hose and jet, that is to say, by
flushing the streets with water at a high pressure,
as the sewers are now flushed; and so, by
<i>washing</i> rather than <i>sweeping</i> the dirt of the
streets into the sewers, through the momentum
of the stream of water, dispensing altogether with
the scavager’s broom, shovel, and cart.</p>

<p>In order to complete this account of the scavaging
of the streets of London, I must, in conclusion,
say a few words on this method, advocated
as it is by the Board of Health, and sanctioned by
scientific men. By the application of a hose, with
a jet or water pipe attached to a fire-plug, the
water being at high pressure, a stream of fluid is
projected along the street’s surface with force enough
to <i>wash</i> away all before it into the sewers, while
by the same apparatus it can be thrown over the
fronts of the houses. This mode of street-cleansing
prevails in some American cities, especially in
Philadelphia, where the principal thoroughfares
are said to be kept admirably clean by it; while
the fronts of the houses are as bright as those in
the towns of Holland, where they are washed,
not by mechanical appliances, but by water thrown
over them out of scoops by hand labour&mdash;one of
the instances of the minute and indefatigable industry
of the Dutch.</p>

<p>It is stated in one of the Reports of the Board
of Health, that “unless cleansing be general and
simultaneous, much of the dirt of one district is
carried by traffic into another. By the subdivision
of the metropolis into small districts, the duty of
cleansing the <i>public</i> carriage-way is thrown upon
a number of obscure and irresponsible authorities;
while the duty of cleansing the <i>public</i> footways,
which are no less important, <i>are</i> charged upon
multitudes of private individuals.” [The grammar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
is the Board of Health’s grammar.] “It is a false
pecuniary economy, in the case of the poorest inhabitants
of court or alley, who obtain their livelihood
by any regular occupation, to charge upon
each family the duty of cleansing the footway
before their doors. The performance of this service
daily, at a rate of 1<i>d.</i> <i>per week</i> per house or per
family, would be an economy in soap and clothes
to persons the average value of whose time is never
less than 2<i>d.</i> per hour.” [This is at the rate of 2<i>s.</i>
a day; did this most innocent Board <i>never</i> hear
of work yielding 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week? But the
sanitary authorities seem to be as fond as teetotallers
of “going to extremes.”]</p>

<p>In another part of the same Report the process
and results are described. It is also stated that
for the success of this method of street purification
the pavement must be good; for “a powerful jet,
applied by the hose, would scoop out hollows in
unpaved places, and also loosen and remove the
stones in those that are badly paved.” As every
public place ought to be well-paved, this necessity
of new and good pavement is no reasonable objection
to the plan, though it certainly admits of a question
as to the durability of the roads&mdash;the macadamized
especially&mdash;under this continual soaking.
Sir Henry Parnell, the great road authority, speaks
of wet as the main destroyer of the highways.</p>

<p>It is stated in the Report, after the mention of
experiments having been made by Mr. Lovick,
Mr. Hale, and Mr. Lee (Mr. Lee being one of the
engineering inspectors of the Board), that</p>

<p>“Mr. Lovick, at the instance of the Metropolitan
Commissioners of Sewers, conducted his
experiments with such jets as could be obtained
from the water companies’ mains in eligible places;
but the pressure was low and insufficient. Nevertheless,
it appeared that, taking the extra quantity
of water required at the actual expense of
pumping, the paved surfaces might be washed
clean at one-half the price of the scavagers’
manual labour in sweeping. Mr. Lee’s trials
were made at Sheffield, with the aid of a more
powerful and suitable pressure, and he found that
with such pressure as he obtained the cleansing
might be effected in one-third the time, and at
one-third the usual expense, of the scavagers’
labour of sweeping the surface with the broom.”
[This expense varies, and the Board nowhere
states at what rate it is computed; the scavagers’
wages varying 100 per cent.]</p>

<p>“The effect of this mode of cleansing in close
courts and streets,” it is further stated, “was
found to be peculiarly grateful in hot weather.
The water was first thrown up and diffused in a
thin sheet, it was then applied rapidly to cleansing
the surface and the side walls, as well as the
pavements.” Mr. Lovick states that the immediate
effect of this operation was to lower the temperature,
and to produce a sense of freshness, similar
to that experienced after a heavy thunder-shower
in hot weather. But there is nothing said as to
the probable effect of this state of things in winter&mdash;a
hard frost for instance. The same expedient
was resorted to for cooling the yards and outer
courts of hospitals, and the shower thrown on the
windows of the wards afforded great relief. Mr.
Lovick, in his Report on the trial works for
cleansing courts, <span class="lock">states:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The importance of water as an agent in the
improvement and preservation of health being in
proportion to the unhealthiness or depressed condition
of districts, its application to close courts
and densely-populated localities, in which a low
sanitary condition must obtain, is of primary importance.
Having shown the practicability of
applying this system (cleansing by jets of water)
to the general cleansing of the streets, my further
labours have been, and are now, directed to this
end.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of ascertaining the effect
produced by operations of this nature upon the
atmosphere, two courts were selected: Church-passage,
New Compton-street, open at both ends,
with a carriage-way in the centre, and footway
on each side; and Lloyd’s-court, Crown-street, St.
Giles’s, a close court, with, at one entrance, a
covered passage about 40 feet in length: both
courts were in a very filthy condition; in Church-passage
there were dead decaying cats and fish,
with offal, straw, and refuse scattered over the
surface; at one end an entrance to a private yard
was used as a urinal; in every part there were
most offensive smells.</p>

<p>“Lloyd’s-court was in a somewhat similar
condition, the covered entrance being used as a
general urinal, presenting a disgusting appearance;
the whole atmosphere of the court was loaded with
highly-offensive effluvia; in the covered entrance
this was more particularly discernible.</p>

<p>“The property of water, as an absorbent, was
rendered strikingly apparent in the immediate
and marked effects of its application, a purity and
freshness remarkably contrasted to the former
close and foul condition prevailing throughout.
A test of this, striking and unexpected, was the
change at different periods in the relative condition
of atmosphere of the courts and of the contiguous
streets. In their ordinary condition, as
might have been expected, the atmosphere was
purer in the streets than in the courts; it was to
be inferred that the cleansing would have more
nearly assimilated these conditions. This was
not only the case, but it was found to have
effected a complete change; the atmosphere of
the courts at the close of the operations being far
fresher and purer than the atmosphere of the
streets. The effect produced was in every respect
satisfactory and complete; and was the theme of
conversation with the lookers-on, and with the
men who conducted the operations.</p>

<p>“The expense of these operations, including
water, would be, <span class="lock">for&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Church-passage (time, five minutes), 1&frac12;<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“Lloyd’s-court (time, ten minutes), 3&frac14;<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Hale, another officer, gave a similar
statement.”</p>

<p>Other experiments are thus <span class="lock">detailed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Lascelles-court, Broad-street, St. Giles’s. This
court was pointed out to me as one of the worst
in London. Before cleansing it smelt <i>intolerable</i>,”
[<i>sic</i>] “and looked disgusting. Besides an abun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>dance
of ordinary filth arising from the exposure
of refuse, the surface of the court contained heaps
of human excrement, there being only one privy
to the whole court, and that not in a state to be
publicly used.... The cleansing operations
were commenced by sprinkling the court with
deodorising fluid, mixed with 20 times its volume
of water; a great change, from a very pungent
odour to an imperceptible smell, was immediately
effected; after which the refuse of the court was
washed away, and the pavement thoroughly
cleansed by the hose and jet; and now this place,
which before was in a state almost indescribable,
presented an appearance of comparative comfort
and respectability.”</p>

<p>It is stated as the result of another experiment
in “an ordinary wide street with plenty of traffic,”
that “water-carts and ordinary rains only create
the mud which the jet entirely removes, giving to
the pavement the appearance of having been as
thoroughly cleansed as the private stone steps in
front of the houses.”</p>

<p>With respect to Mr. Lee’s experiments in
Sheffield, I find that Messrs. Guest, of Rotherham,
are patentees of a tap for the discharge
of water at high pressures, and that they had
adapted their invention to the purpose of a fire-plug
and stand pipe suitable for street-cleansing by
the hose and jet. Church-street, one of the principal
thoroughfares, was experimentally cleansed
by this process: “The carriage-way is from 20
to 24 feet wide, and about 150 yards long. It
was washed almost as clean as a house-floor in five
minutes.” Mr. Lee expresses his conviction that,
by the agency of the hose and jet, every street in
that populous borough might be cleansed at about
1<i>s.</i> per annum for each house. “The principal
thoroughfares,” he states, “could be thus made
perfectly clean, three times every week, before
business hours, and the minor streets and lanes
twice, or once per week, at later hours in the day,
by the agency of an abundant supply of water,
at <i>less than half the sum necessary for the cartage
alone</i> of an equal quantity of refuse in a solid or
semi-fluid condition.”</p>

<p>The highways most frequented in Sheffield constitute
about one-half of the whole extent of the
streets and roads in the borough, measuring 47
miles. This length, Mr. Lee computes, might be
effectually cleansed with the hose and jet, ten
miles of it three times a week, 21 miles twice a
week, and 16 miles once a week, a total of
88 miles weekly, or 4576 miles yearly. The
quantity of Water required would be 3000 gallons
a mile, or a yearly total of 13,728,000 gallons.
This water might be supplied, Mr. Lee opines, at
1<i>d.</i> per 1000 gallons (57<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> per annum), although
the price obtained by the Water-works Company
was 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> per 1000 gallons (371<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> per annum).
“I now proceed,” he says, “to the cost of labour:
4576 miles per annum is equal to 14⅔ miles for
each working day, or to six sets of two men
cleansing 2&frac12; miles per day each set. To these
must be added three horses and carts, and three
carters, for the removal of such <i>débris</i> as cannot
be washed away and for such parts of the town as
cannot be cleansed by this system, making a total
of fifteen men. Their wages I would fix at 50<i>l.</i>
per annum each. The estimate is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>The estimate, it will be seen, is based on the
supposition that <i>the water supply should be at
the public cost</i>, and not a specific charge for the
purposes of street-cleansing.</p>

<p>The 47 miles of highway of Sheffield is but
three miles less than those of the city of London,
the cost of cleansing which is, according to the
estimate before given, no less than 18,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The Sheffield account is divested of all calculations
as to house-dust and ashes, and the charge
for watering-carts; but, taking merely the sum
paid to scavaging contractors, and assigning 1000<i>l.</i>
(out of the 2485<i>l.</i>), as the proportion of salaries,
&amp;c., under the department of scavagery in the
management of the City Commissioners, we find
that while the expense of street-cleansing by the
Sheffield hose and jet was little more than
34<i>l.</i>, in London, by the ordinary mode, it was
upwards of 140<i>l.</i> per mile, or more than four
times as much. The hose and jet system is
said to have washed the streets of Sheffield as
clean as a house-floor, which could not be said of
it in London. The streets of the City, it should
also be borne in mind, are now swept daily;
Mr. Lee proposes only a periodical cleaning for
Sheffield, or once, twice, and thrice a week. Of
the cost of the experiments made in London with
the hose and jet, in Lascelles-court, &amp;c., nothing is
said.</p>

<p>Street-cleansing by the hose and jet is, then, as
yet but an experiment. It has not, like the street-orderly
mode, been tested continuously or systematically;
but the experiments are so curious and
sometimes so startling in their results that it was
necessary to give a brief account of them here, in
order to render this account of the cleansing of the
streets of the metropolis as comprehensive as possible.
For my own part, I must confess the
street-orderly system appears to excel all other
modes of scavagery, producing at once the greatest
cleanliness with the greatest employment to the
poor. Nor am I so convinced as the theoretic and
crotchety Board of Health as to the healthfulness
of dampness, or the daily evaporation of a sheet of
even clean water equal in extent to the entire surface
of the London streets. It is certainly <i>doubtful</i>,
to say the least, whether so much additional moisture
might <i>improve</i> the public health, which the
Board are instituted to protect; rain certainly contributes
to cleanliness, and yet no one would
advocate continued wet weather as a source of
general convalescence.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this account of the scavaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of London, with the following brief statement as
to the mode in which these matters are conducted
abroad.</p>

<p>In Paris, where our system of parochial legislation
and management is unknown, the scavaging
of the streets&mdash;so frequently matters of private
speculation with us&mdash;is under the immediate
direction of the municipality, and the Government
publish the returns, as they do of the revenue
of their capital from the abattoirs, the interments,
and other sources.</p>

<p>In the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moniteur</i> for December 10, 1848, it
is stated that the refuse of the streets of Paris
sells for 500,500 francs (20,020<i>l.</i>), when sold by
auction in the mass; and 3,800,000 francs (equal
to 152,000<i>l.</i>) when, after having lain in the
proper receptacles, until fit for manure, it is sold
by the cubic foot. In 1823, the streets of Paris
were leased for 75,000 francs (3000<i>l.</i>) per annum;
in 1831 the value was 166,000 francs (6640<i>l.</i>);
and since 1845 the price has risen to the sum first
named, viz., 500,500 francs (20,020<i>l.</i>); from
which, however, is to be deducted the expense of
cleansing, &amp;c. I may add, that the receptacles
alluded to are large places provided by Government,
where the manure is deposited and left to
ferment for twelve or eighteen months.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cost and Traffic of the Streets
of London.</span></h3>

<p>I have, at page <a href="#Page_183">183</a> of the present volume, given
a brief statement of the annual cost attending the
keeping of the streets of the metropolis in working
order.</p>

<p>The formation of the streets of a capital like
London, the busiest in the world&mdash;streets traversed
daily by what Cowper, even in his day, described
as “the ten thousand wheels” of commerce&mdash;is
an elaborate and costly work.</p>

<p>In my former account I gave an estimate which
referred to the amount dispensed weekly in
wages for the labour of the workmen engaged in
laying down the paved roads of the metropolis.
This was at the rate of 100,000<i>l.</i> per week; that
is to say, calculating the operation of relaying the
streets to occupy one year in every five, there is
no less than 5,200,000<i>l.</i> expended in that time
among the workpeople so engaged. The sum
expended in labour for the continued repairs of
the roads, after being so relaid, appears to be
about 20,000<i>l.</i> per week<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, or, in round numbers,
about 1,000,000<i>l.</i> a year; so that the gross sum
annually disbursed to the labourers engaged in
the construction of the roads of London would
seem to be about 2,250,000<i>l.</i>, that is to say,
1,000,000<i>l.</i> for repairing the old roads, and
1,250,000<i>l.</i> per annum for laying down new ones
in their place.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to set forth the gross
cost of the metropolitan highways, that is to say,
the sum annually expended in both labour and
materials, as well for relaying as for repairing
the roads.</p>

<p>The granite-built streets cost, when relaid,
about 11,000<i>l.</i> the mile, of ten yards’ width,
which is at the rate of 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the square yard,
materials and labour included, the granite (Aberdeen)
being 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> per ton, and one ton of “seven-inch”
being sufficient to cover about three square
yards.</p>

<p>The average cost of a macadamized road,
materials and labour included, if constructed from
the foundation, is about 4400<i>l.</i> per street mile
(ten yards wide)&mdash;5<i>s.</i> the superficial yard being a
fair price for materials and labour.</p>

<p>Wood pavement, on the other hand, costs about
9680<i>l.</i> a mile of ten yards’ width for materials
and labour, which is at the rate of 11<i>s.</i> the superficial
yard.</p>

<p>The cost of <i>repairs</i>, materials and labour included,
is, for granite pavement about 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> per
square yard, or 100<i>l.</i> the street mile of ten yards
wide; for “Macadam” it is from 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
or an average of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per superficial yard, which
is at the rate of 1320<i>l.</i> the street mile; while the
wood pavement costs about the same for repairs as
the granite.</p>

<p>The total cost of repairing the streets of London,
then, may be taken as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But the above refers only to the road, and besides
this, there is, as a gentleman to whom I am
much indebted for valuable information on the
subject, reminds me, the foot paving, granite
curb, and granite channel not included. The
usual price for <i>paving</i> is 8<i>d.</i> per foot superficial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>

<p>“Accordingly the original cost of the metropolitan
pavements exceeds fourteen millions sterling, and,
calculating that this requires renewal every five
years, the gross annual expenditure will be at the
rate of 2,500,000<i>l.</i> per annum, which, added to
1,822,500<i>l.</i>, gives 4,322,500<i>l.</i>, or upwards of four
millions and a quarter sterling for the entire annual
cost of the London roadways.</p>

<p>“From rather extensive experience,” adds my
informant, “in building operations, and consequently
in making and paying for roads, I am of
opinion that the amount I have shown is under
rather than above the actual cost.</p>

<p>“In a great many parts of the metropolis the
roads are made by the servants of a body of Commissioners
appointed for the purpose; and from
dear-bought experience I can say they are a public
nuisance, and would earnestly caution speculating
builders against taking building ground or
erecting houses in any place where the roads are
under their control. The Commissioners are generally
old retired tradesmen, and have very little to
occupy their attention, and are often quite ignorant
of their duties; I have reason to believe, too, that
some of them even use their little authority to
gratify their dislike to some poor builder in their
district, by meddling and quibbling, and while
that is going on the houses which have been
erected can neither be let nor sold; so that as
the bills given for the materials keep running,
the builder, when they fall due, is ruined, for
his creditors will not take his unlet houses
for their debts, and no one else will purchase
them until let, for none will rent them
without proper accesses. I feel certain that in
those parts where the roads are made by Commissioners
three times more builders, in proportion
to their number, get into difficulties than in the
districts where they are permitted to make the
roads themselves.”</p>

<p>The paved ways and roads of London, then, it
appears, cost in round numbers 10,000,000<i>l.</i>
sterling, and require nearly 2,000,000<i>l.</i> to be
expended upon them annually for repairs.</p>

<p>But this is not the sole expense attendant upon
the construction of the streets of the metropolis.
Frequently, in the formation of new lines of
thoroughfare, large masses of property have to
be bought up, removed, and new buildings erected
at considerable cost. In a return made pursuant
to an order of the Court of Common Council,
dated 23rd October, 1851, for “An account of all

<p>Hence the aggregate expense of the preceding
improvements has been upwards of 3,000,000<i>l.</i>
sterling.</p>

<p>I have now, in order to complete this account
of the cost of paving and cleansing the thoroughfares
of the metropolis, only to add the following
statement as to the traffic of the principal thoroughfares
in the city of London, for which I am indebted
to Mr. Haywood, the City Surveyor.</p>

<p>By the subjoined Return it will be seen that
there are two tides as it were in the daily current
of locomotion in the City&mdash;the one being at its
flood at 11 o’clock <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, after which it falls
gradually till 2 o’clock, when it is at its lowest
ebb, and then begins to rise, gradually till
5 o’clock, when it reaches its second flood, and
then begins to decline once more. The point
of greatest traffic in the City is London-bridge,
where the conveyances passing and repassing
amount to 13,099 in the course of twelve hours<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Of these it would appear, that 9351 consist of one-horse
vehicles and equestrians, 3389 of two-horse
conveyances, and only 359 of vehicles
drawn by more than two horses. The one-horse
vehicles would seem to be between two and three
times as many as the two-horse, which form about
one-fourth of the whole, while those drawn by
more than two horses constitute about one-sixtieth
of the entire number.</p>

<p>The Return does not mention the state of the
weather on the several days and hours at which
the observations were made, nor does it tell us
whether there was any public event occurring on
those days which was likely to swell or diminish
the traffic beyond its usual proportions. The table,
moreover, it should be remembered, is confined to
the observations of only one day in each locality, so
that we must be guarded in receiving that which
records a mere accidental set of circumstances as
an example of the general course of events. It
would have been curious to have extended the
observations throughout the night, and so have
ascertained the difference in the traffic; and also
to have noted the decrease in the number of
vehicles passing during a continuously wet as well
as a showery day. The observations should be
further carried out to different seasons, in order
to be rendered of the highest value. Mr. Haywood
and the City authorities would really be conferring
a great boon on the public by so doing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Rubbish Carters.</span></h3>

<p>The public cleansing trade, I have before said,
consists of as many divisions as there are distinct
species of refuse to be removed, and these appear
to be four. There is the <i>house</i>-refuse, consisting
of two different kinds, as (1) the wet house-refuse
or “slops,” and “night-soil,” and (2) the dry
house-refuse, or dust and soot; and there is the
<i>street</i>-refuse, also consisting of two distinct kinds,
as (3) the wet street-refuse, or mud and dirt; and
(4) the dry street-refuse or “rubbish.”</p>

<p>I now purpose dealing with the labourers engaged
in the collection and removal of the last-mentioned
kind of refuse.</p>

<p>Technologically there are several varieties of
“rubbish,” or rather “<i>dirt</i>,” for such appears to
be the generic term, of which “rubbish” is
<i>strictly</i> a species. Dirt, according to the understanding
among the rubbish-carters, would seem
to consist of any solid earthy matter, which is of
an useless or refuse character. This dirt the trade
divides into two distinct kinds, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. “Soft dirt,” or refuse clay (of which “dry
dirt,” or refuse soil or mould, is a variety).</p>

<p>2. “Hard-dirt,” or “hard-core,” consisting of
the refuse bricks, chimney-pots, slates, &amp;c., when
a house is pulled down, as well as the broken
bottles, pans, pots, or crocks, and oyster-shells,
&amp;c., which form part of the contents of the dustman’s
cart.</p>

<p>The phrase “hard-core”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> seems strictly to
mean all such refuse matter as will admit of
being used as the foundation of roads, buildings,
&amp;c. “Rubbish,” on the other hand, appears to
be limited, by the trade, to “dry dirt;” out of the
trade, however, and etymologically speaking, it
signifies all such <i>dry</i> and <i>hard</i> refuse matter as is
rendered useless by wear and tear<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. The term
<i>dirt</i>, on the other hand, is generally applied to
<i>soft</i> refuse matter, and <i>dust</i> to <i>dry</i> refuse matter
in a state of minute division, while <i>slops</i> is the
generic term for all <i>wet</i> or <i>liquid</i> refuse matter.
I shall here restrict the term rubbish to all that
dry and hard refuse matter which is the residuum
of certain worn-out or “used-up” earthen commodities,
as well as the surplus earth which is
removed whenever excavations are made, either
for the building of houses, the cutting of railways,
the levelling of roads, the laying down of pipes or
drains, and the sinking of wells.</p>

<p>The commodities whose residuum goes to swell
the annual supply of <i>rubbish</i>, are generally of an
earthy nature. Such commodities as are made of
<i>fibrous</i> or <i>textile</i> materials, go, when “used up,”
chiefly to form manure if of an animal nature, and
to be converted into paper if of a vegetable origin.
The refuse materials of our woollen clothes, our
old coats and trousers, are either torn to pieces
and re-manufactured into shoddy, or become the
invigorators of our hop and other plants; whereas
those of our linen or cotton garments, our old
shirts and petticoats, form the materials of our
books and letters; while our old ropes, &amp;c., are
converted into either brown paper or oakum.
Those commodities, on the other hand, which are
made of <i>leathern</i> materials, become, when worn
out, the ingredients of the prussiate of potash and
other nitrogenised products manufactured by our
chemists. Our old <i>wooden</i> commodities, again,
are used principally to kindle our fires; while
the refuse of our fires themselves, whether the
soot which is deposited in the chimney above,
or the ashes which fall below, are employed
mainly to increase the fertility of our land. Our
worn-out <i>metal</i> commodities, on the other hand,
are newly melted, and go to form fresh commodities
when the metals are of the scarcer kind, as
gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, and even iron;
and when of the more common kind, as is the case
with old tin, and occasionally iron vessels, they
either become the ingredients in some of our chemical
manufactures, or else when formed of tin are
cut up into smaller and inferior commodities. Even
the detritus of our <i>streets</i> is used as the soil of our
market gardens. All this we have already seen,
and we have now to deal more particularly with
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the refuse of the sole remaining materials, viz.,
those of an <i>earthy</i> kind, and out of which are
made our bricks, our earthenware and porcelain,
as well as our glass, plaster, and stone commodities.
What becomes of all these materials
when the articles made of them are no longer fit
for use? The old glass is, like the old metal, re-melted
and made into new commodities; some
broken bottles are used for the tops of walls as a
protection against trespassers; and the old bricks,
when sound, are employed again for inferior brick-work;
but what becomes of the rest of the
earthen materials&mdash;the unsound bricks or “bats,”
the old plaster and mortar, the refuse slates and
tiles and chimney-pots, the broken pans, and
dishes, and other crocks&mdash;in a word, the potsherds
and pansherds<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, as the rubbish-carters call
them&mdash;what is done with these?</p>

<p>But rubbish, as we have seen, consists not only
of refuse earthen commodities, but of refuse earth
itself: such as the soil removed during excavations
for the foundations of houses, for the cuttings
of railways, the levelling of roads, the formation
of parks, the laying down of pipes or drains, and
the sinking of wells. For each and all of these
operations there is necessarily a certain quantity
of soil removed, and the question that naturally
occurs to the mind is, what is done with it?</p>

<p>There is, moreover, a third kind of rubbish,
which, though having an animal origin, consists
chiefly of earthy matter, and that is the shells of
oysters, and other shell-fish. Whence go they,
since these shells are of a comparatively indestructible
nature, and thousands of such fish are consumed
annually in the metropolis? What, the
inquirer asks, becomes of the refuse bony coverings
of such fish?</p>

<p>Let us first, however, endeavour to estimate
what quantity of each of these three kinds of
rubbish is annually produced in London, beginning
with the refuse earthen commodities.</p>

<p>There is no published account of the quantity
of <i>crockeryware</i> annually manufactured in this
country. Mr. McCulloch tells us, “It is estimated,
that the <i>value</i> of the various sorts of
earthenware produced at the potteries may
amount to about 1,700,000<i>l.</i> or 1,800,000<i>l.</i> a
year; and that the earthenware produced at
Worcester, Derby, and other parts of the country,
may amount to about 850,000<i>l.</i> or more, making the
whole value of the manufacture 2,550,000<i>l.</i> or
2,650,000<i>l.</i> a year.” What proportion of this
quantity may fall to the share of the metropolis,
and what proportion of the whole may be annually
destroyed, I know of no means of judging. We
must therefore go some other way to work in
order to arrive at the required information. Now,
it has been before shown, that the quantity of
“dust,” or dry refuse from houses, annually collected,
amounts to 900,000 tons or chaldrons
yearly; and I find, on inquiry at the principal
“yards,” that the average quantity of Potsherds
and broken crockery is at the rate of about half
a bushel to every load of dust, or say 1 per cent.
out of the entire quantity collected. At other
yards, I find the proportion of sherds to be about
the same, so that we may fairly assume that the
gross quantity of broken earthenware produced
in London is in round numbers 9000 loads or
tons per annum. The sherds run about 250
pieces to the bushel, and assuming every five of
such pieces to be the remains of an entire article,
there would be in each bushel the fragments of
fifty earthenware vessels; and thus the total
quantity of crockeryware destroyed yearly in the
metropolis will amount to 18,000,000 vessels.</p>

<p>As to the quantity of <i>refuse bricks</i>, the number
annually produced, which is between 1,500,000,000
and 2,000,000,000, will give us no knowledge
of the quantity yearly converted into rubbish.
In order to arrive at this, we must ascertain the
number of houses pulled down in the course of
the twelvemonth; and I find, by the Returns of
the Registrar-General, that the buildings removed
between 1841 and 1851 have been as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Decrease in the Number of Houses
throughout London between 1841 and
1851.</span></h4>

</table></div>

<p>Thus, then, we perceive that there have been,
upon an average, very nearly 200 houses annually
pulled down in London within the last ten years,
and I find, on inquiry among those who are
likely to be the best-informed on such matters,
that each house so pulled down will yield from
40 to 50 loads of rubbish; so that, altogether, the
quantity of refuse bricks, slates, tiles, chimney-pots,
&amp;c., annually produced in London must
be no less than 8000 loads.</p>

<p>But the above estimate refers only to those
houses which have been pulled down and never
rebuilt; so that, in order to arrive at the gross
quantity of this kind of rubbish yearly produced
in the metropolis, we must add to the preceding
amount the quantity accruing from such houses as are
pulled down and built up again, or newly fronted
and repaired, which are by far the greater number.
These, I find, may be estimated at between 5
and 10 per cent. of the gross number of houses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the metropolis. In some quarters (the older parts
of London, for instance,) the proportion is much
higher, while in the suburbs, or newer districts, it
is scarcely half per cent. Each of the houses so
new-fronted or repaired may be said to yield, on
an average, 10 loads of rubbish, and, at this rate,
the yearly quantity of refuse bricks, mortar, &amp;c.,
proceeding from such a source, will be 150,000
loads per annum; so that the total amount of
rubbish produced in London by the demolition
and reparation of houses would appear to be about
160,000 loads yearly.</p>

<p>The quantity of refuse <i>oyster shells</i> may easily
be found by the number of oysters annually sold
in Billingsgate-market. These, from the returns
which I obtained from the market salesmen, and
printed at p. 63 of the first volume of this work,
appear to be, in round numbers, 500,000,000; and,
calculating that one-third of this quantity is sent
into the country, the total number of shells
remaining in the metropolis may be estimated at
about 650,000,000. Reckoning, then, that 500
shells go to the bushel (the actual number was
found experimentally to be between 525 and 550),
and consequently that 20,000 are contained in
every load, we may conclude that the gross quantity
of refuse oyster shells annually produced in
London average somewhere about 30,000 loads.
That this is an approximation to the true quantity
there can be little doubt, for, on inquiry at one of
the largest dust-yards, I was informed by the hill-man
that the quantity of oyster-shells collected
with the refuse dust from houses in the vicinity
of Shoreditch, Whitechapel, and other localities at
the east-end of the metropolis, averages 6 bushels
to the load of dust; about the west-end, however,
half a bushel or a bushel to each load is the average
ratio; while from the City there is none, the
house “dust” there being free from oyster-shells.
In taking one district, however, with another, I
am assured that the average may be safely computed
at 2 bushels of oyster-shells to every 3 loads
of dust; hence, as the gross amount of house-dust
is equal to 900,000 tons or loads per annum, the
quantity of refuse oyster-shells collected yearly by
the dustmen may be taken at 15,000 loads. But,
besides these, there is the quantity got rid of by
the costermongers, which seldom or never appear
in the dust-bins. The costers sell about 124,000,000
oysters per annum, and thus the extra quantity of
shells resulting from these means would be about
12,400 loads; so that the gross quantity of refuse
oyster-shells actually produced in London may be
said to average between 25,000 and 30,000 loads
per annum.</p>

<p>There still remains the quantity of <i>refuse
earth</i> to be calculated; this may be estimated as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Foundations of Houses.</i>&mdash;Each house that
is built requires the ground to be excavated from
two to three yards deep, the average area of each
being about nine yards square. This gives between
160 and 200 cubic yards of earth removed
from the foundation of each house. A cubic yard
of earth is a load, so that there are between 160
and 200 loads of earth displaced in the building
of every new house.</p>

<p>The following statement <span class="lock">shows&mdash;</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Number of Houses Built throughout
London between 1841 and 1851.</span></h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th></th><th>Total No. of Houses built in 10 Years.</th><th>Average No. of Houses built per Year.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="left">West Districts</td><td>9,624</td><td>962·4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">North Districts</td><td>13,778</td><td>1377·8</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Central Districts</td><td>349</td><td>34·9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">East Districts</td><td>8,343</td><td>834·3</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">South Districts</td><td>14,807</td><td>1480·7</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">Total</td><td class="total">46,901</td><td class="total">4690·1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence, estimating the number of new houses
built yearly in the metropolis at 4500, the total
quantity of earth removed for the foundations of
the buildings throughout London would be 800,000
loads per annum.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Cuttings of Railways.</i>&mdash;The railways
formed within the area of the metropolis during
the last ten years have been&mdash;the Great Northern;
the Camden Town, and Bow; the West India
Docks and Bow; and the North Kent Lines.
The extension of the Southampton Railway
from Vauxhall to Waterloo-bridge, as well as
the Richmond Line, has also been formed within
the same period, but for these no cuttings have
been made.</p>

<p>The Railway Cuttings made within the area of
the Metropolis Proper during the last ten years
have been to the following <span class="lock">extent:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td class="left">North Kent</td><td>2</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>528,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Hence, the gross quantity of earth removed from
railway cuttings within the last ten years has
been 1,636,800 loads, or say, in round numbers,
160,000 loads per annum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>The Cutting of Roads and Streets.</i>&mdash;According
to a Return presented to Parliament, there
were 200 miles of new streets formed within the
metropolitan police district between the years
1839-49; but in the formation of these no earth
has been taken away; on the contrary a considerable
quantity has been required for their
construction. In the case of the lowering of
Holborn-hill, that which was removed from the
top was used to fill up the hollow.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Formation of Parks.</i>&mdash;The only park
that has been constructed during the last ten
years in the metropolis is Victoria Park, at the
east end of the town; but I am informed that, in
the course of the works there, no earth was
carted away, the soil which was removed from
one part being used for the levelling of another.</p>

<p>5. <i>Pipe and Sewer Works.</i>&mdash;The earth displaced
in the course of these operations is
usually put back into the ground whence it
was taken, excepting in the formation of
some new sewer, and then a certain proportion
has to be carted away. Upon inquiry among
those who are likely to be best informed, I am
assured that 1000 loads may be taken as the
quantity carted away in the course of the last year.</p>

<p>6. <i>Well-sinking.</i>&mdash;In this there has been but
little done. Those who are best informed assure
me that within the last ten years no such works
of any magnitude have been executed.</p>

<p>The account as to the quantity of rubbish removed
in London, then, stands <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>Thus, then, we perceive that the gross quantity
of rubbish that has to be annually removed
throughout the metropolis is upwards of 1,000,000
loads per annum.</p>

<p>Now what is done with the vast amount of
refuse matter? Whither is it carried? How is it
disposed of?</p>

<p><i>The rubbish from the house building or removing</i>
is of no value to the master carter, and is shot
gratuitously wherever there is the privilege of
shooting it; this privilege, however, is very often
usurped. Great quantities used to be shot in
what were, until these last eight years, Bishop
Bonner’s Fields, but now Victoria Park. At the
present time this sort of rubbish is often slily
deposited in localities generally known as “the
ruins,” being places from which houses, and indeed
streets, have been removed, and the sites left bare
and vacant.</p>

<p>But the main localities for the deposition of this
kind of refuse are in the fields round about the
metropolis. Each particular district appears to have
its own special “shoot,” as it is called, for rubbish,
of which the following are the principal.</p>


<h4><i>Rubbish shoots.</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rubbish of Kensington and Chelsea is shot
in the Pottery Grounds and Kensington-fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of St. George’s Hanover-square,
Marylebone, and Paddington, is shot in the
fields about Notting-hill and Kilburn.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Westminster, Strand, Holborn,
St. Martin’s, St. Giles’s, St. James’s, Westminster,
West London, and Southwark, is
shot in Cubitt’s fields at Millbank and Westminster
improvements.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Hampstead is shot in the fields
at back of Haverstock-hill.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Saint Pancras is shot in the
Copenhagen-fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Islington, Clerkenwell, and St.
Luke’s, is shot in the Eagle Wharf-road and
Shepherdess-fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of East London and City is shot
in the Haggerstone-fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Whitechapel, St. George’s in the
East, and Stepney, is shot in Stepney fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Hackney, Bethnal-green, and
Shoreditch, is shot in the Bonkers-pond,
Hackney-road.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Poplar is shot in the fields at
back of New Town, Poplar.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Bermondsey is shot in the
Bermondsey fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Newington, Camberwell, and
Lambeth, is shot in Walworth-common and
Kennington-fields.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Wandsworth is shot in Potters-hole,
Wandsworth-common.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Greenwich and Lewisham is
shot in Russia-common, near Lewisham.</p>

<p>The rubbish of Rotherhithe is used for ballast.</p></div>

<p>The quantity of rubbish annually shot in each
of the above-mentioned localities appears to range
from 5000 up to as high as 30,000 and 40,000 loads.</p>

<p>Of the earth removed in forming the foundation
of new houses, between one-fourth and one-sixth
of the whole is used to make the gardens at
the back, and the bed of the roads in front of
them, while the entire quantity of the soil displaced
in the execution of the “cuttings” of railways
is carted away in the trucks of the company
to form embankments in other places. Hence
there would appear to be about from 160,000 to
200,000 loads of refuse bricks, potsherds, pansherds,
and oyster-shells, and about 600,000
loads of refuse earth deposited every year in the
fields or “shoots” in the vicinity of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The refuse earth displaced in forming the foundations
of houses is generally carted away by the
builders’ men, so that it is principally the refuse
bricks, &amp;c., that the rubbish-carters are engaged
in removing; these they usually carry to the
shoots already indicated, or to such other localities
where the hard core may be needed for forming
the foundation of roads, or the rubbish be required
for certain other purposes.</p>

<p>The principal <i>use to which the “rubbish” is put</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
is for levelling, when the hollow part of any
newly-made road has to be filled up, or garden or
lawn ground has to be levelled for a new mansion.
Rubbish, at one time, was in demand for the ballasting
of small coasting vessels. For such ballasting
2<i>d.</i> a ton has to be paid to the corporation
of the Trinity House. This rubbish has been
used, but sometimes surreptitiously, for ballast,
unmixed with other things. It is, however, light
and inferior ballast, and occupies more space than
the gravel ballast from the bed of the Thames.</p>

<p>Suppose that a collier requires ballast to the
extent of 60 tons; if house rubbish be used it
will occupy the hold to a greater height by about
10 inches than would the ballast derived from the
bed of the Thames. The Thames ballast is supplied
at 1<i>s.</i> a ton; the rubbish-ballast, however,
was only 3<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> a ton, but now it is seldom
used unless to mix with manure, which might be
considered too wet and soft, and likely to ferment
on the voyage to a degree unpleasant even to the
mariners used to such freights. The rubbish, I
am told, checks the fermentation, and gives
consistency to the manure.</p>

<p>I am assured by a tradesman, who ships a considerable
quantity of stable manure collected from
the different mews of the metropolis, that comparatively
little rubbish is now used for ballast
(unless in the way I have stated); even for
mixing, but a few tons a week are required up
and down the river, and perhaps a small quantity
from the wharfs on the several canals. Nothing
was ever paid for the use of this rubbish as ballast,
the carters being well satisfied to have the privilege
of shooting it. Two of the principal shoots by
the river side were at Bell-wharf, Shadwell, and
off Wapping-street. The rubbish of Rotherhithe,
it will be seen, is mainly “shot” as ballast.</p>

<p>The “<i>hard-core</i>” is readily got rid of; sometimes
it is shot gratuitously (or merely with a
small gratuity for beer to the men); but if it have
to be carted three or four miles, it is from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
3<i>s.</i> a load. This is used for the foundations of
houses, the groundwork of roads, and other purposes
where a hard substratum is required. The
hard-core on a new road is usually about nine
inches deep. There are on an average 20 miles
of streets, 15 yards wide, formed annually in
London. Hence there would be upwards of
100,000 loads of hard-core required for this
purpose alone. Where the soil is of a gravelly
nature, but little hard rubbish is needed. Oyster-shells
<i>did</i> form a much greater portion than they
do now of the hard substratum of roads. Eight
or nine years ago the costermongers could sell
their oyster-shells for 6<i>d.</i> a bushel. Now they
cannot, or do not, sell them at all; and the law not
only forbids their deposit in any place whatever,
but forbids their being scattered in the streets,
under a penalty of 5<i>l.</i> But as the same law
provides no place where these shells may be
deposited, the costermongers are in what one of
them described to me as “a quandary.” One man,
who with his wife kept two stalls in Tottenham
Court-road, one for fish (fresh and dried) and
for shell-fish, and the other for fruit and vegetables,
told me that he gave “one of those poor
long-legged fellows who were neither men nor
boys, and who were always starving and hanging
about for a two-penny job, two-pence to carry
away a hamper-full of shells and get rid of them
as he best could. O, where he put them, sir,”
said the man, “I don’t know, I wouldn’t know;
and I shouldn’t have mentioned it to you, only
I saw you last winter and know you’re inquiring
for an honest purpose.”</p>

<p>Another costermonger who has a large barrow
of oysters and mussels, and sometimes of “wet
fish” near King’s-cross, and at the junction of
Leather-lane with Back-hill, Hatton-garden, was
more communicative: “If you’ll walk on with
me, sir,” he said, “<i>I’ll</i> show you where they’re
shot. You may mention my name if you like, sir; I
don’t care a <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;</span> for the crushers; not a blessed
<span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;</span>.” He accordingly conducted me to a place
which seemed adapted for the special purpose. At
the foot of Saffron-hill and the adjacent streets
runs the Fleet-ditch, now a branch of the common
sewers; not covered over as in other parts, but
open, noisome, and, as the dark water flows on,
throwing up a sickening stench. The ditch is indifferently
fenced, so that any one with a little
precaution may throw what he pleases into it.
“There, sir,” said my companion, “there’s the
place where more oyster-shells is thrown than
anywhere in London. They’re thrown in in
the dark.” Assuredly the great share of blame is
not to those who avail themselves of such places
for illegal purposes, but to those who leave such
filthy receptacles available. The scattered oyster-shells
along all the approaches, on both sides, to
this part of the open Fleet-ditch, evince the use
that is made of it in violation of the law. Many
of the costers, however, keep the shells by them
till they amount to several bushels, and then give
the rubbish-carters a few pence to dispose of
them for them.</p>

<p>Some of the costermongers, again, obtain leave to
deposit their oyster-shells in the dustmen’s yards,
where quantities may be seen whitening the dingy
dust-heaps, and a large quantity are collected with
the house-dust and ashes, together with the broken
crockery from the dust-bins of the several houses.
The oyster-shells are carted away with the pansherds,
&amp;c., for the purposes I have mentioned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now come to deal with the rubbish-carters,
that is to say, with the labourers engaged in the
removal of the “hard” species of refuse; of which
we have seen there are between 160,000 and
200,000 loads annually carted away; the refuse
earth, or “soft dirt,” being generally removed by
the builders’ men, and the refuse, crockeryware,
&amp;c., by the dustmen, when collecting the dust
from the “bins” of the several houses.</p>

<p>The master <i>Rubbish-Carters</i> are those who keep
carts and horses to be hired for carting away
the old materials when houses or walls are pulled
down. They are also occasionally engaged in
carrying away the soil or rubbish thrown up
from the foundations of buildings; the excavations
of docks, canals, and sewers; the digging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of artesian wells, &amp;c. This seems to comprise
what in this carrying or removing trade is accounted
“rubbish.”</p>

<p>Perhaps not one of these tradesmen is solely
a rubbish-carter, for they are likewise the carters
of new materials for the use of builders, such as
lime, bricks, stone, gravel, slates, timber, iron-work,
chimney-pieces, &amp;c. Some of them are
public carmen; licensed carmen if they work, or
ply, in the City; but beyond the City boundaries
no licence is necessary. This complication perplexes
the inquiry, but I purpose to confine it, as
much as possible, to the rubbish-carters proper,
having defined what may be understood by
“rubbish.” These carters are also employed in
digging, pick-axing, &amp;c., at the buildings, the
rubbish of which they are engaged to remove.</p>

<p>Among the conveyors of rubbish are no distinctions
as to the kind. Any of them will one
week cart old bricks from a house which has been
pulled down, and the next week be busy in removing
the soil excavated where the foundations
and cellars of a new mansion have been dug.</p>

<p>From inquiries made in each of the different
districts of the metropolis, there appear to be
from 140 to 150 tradesmen who, with the carting
of bricks, lime, and other building commodities,
add also that of rubbish-carting. These
“masters” among them find employment for 840
labouring men, some of whom I find to have been
in the service of the same employer upwards of
20 years.</p>

<p>The Post-Office Directory, under the head of
rubbish-carters, gives the names of only 35 of the
principal masters, of whom several are marked as
scavagers, dust-contractors, nightmen, and road-contractors.
The occupation abstract of the
census, on the other hand, totally ignores the
existence of any such class of workmen, masters
as well as operatives. I find, however, by actual
visitation and inquiry in each of the metropolitan
districts, and thus learning the names of the
several masters as well as the number of men in
their employment, that there may be said to be,
in round numbers, 150 master rubbish-carters,
employing among them 840 operatives throughout
London.</p>

<p>A large proportion of this number of labouring
men, however, are casual hands, who have been
taken on when the trade was busy during the
summer (which is the “brisk season” of
rubbish-cartage), and who are discharged in the
slack time; during which period they obtain jobs
at dust-carting or scavaging, or some such out-door
employment. Among the employers there
are scarcely any who are purely rubbish-carters,
the large majority consisting of dust and road-contractors,
carmen, dairymen, and persons who
have two or three horses and carts at their disposal.
When a master builder or bricklayer
obtains a contract, he hires horses and carts to
take away any rubbish which may previously
have been deposited. The contract of the King’s
Cross Terminus of the Great Northern Railway,
for instance, has been undertaken by Mr. W.
Jay, the builder; and, not having sufficient conveyances
to cart the rubbish away, he has hired
horses and carts of others to assist in the removal
of it. The same mode is adopted in other parts
of the metropolis, where any improvements are
going on. The owners of horses and carts let
them out to hire at from 7<i>s.</i> for one horse, to 14<i>s.</i>
for two per day. If, however, the job be unusually
large, the master rubbish-carters often
take it by contract themselves.</p>

<p>Although the <i>operative rubbish-carters</i> may be
classed among unskilled labourers, they are, perhaps,
less miscellaneous, as a body, than other
classes of open-air workers. Before they can
obtain work of the best description it is necessary
that they should have some knowledge of the
management of a horse in the drawing of a loaded
carriage, or of the way in which the animal
should be groomed and tended in the stable. I
was told by an experienced carman, that he, or
any one with far less than his experience, could
in a moment detect, merely by the mode in which
a man would put the harness on a horse and yoke
him to the cart, whether he was likely to prove
a master of his craft in that line or not. My
informant had noticed, more especially many years
ago, when labour was not so abundantly obtainable
as it was last year, that men out of work
would offer him their services as carmen even if
they had never handled a whip in their lives, as
if little more were wanted than to walk by the
horse’s side. An experienced carter knows how
to ease and direct the animal when heavily burdened,
or when the road is rugged; and I am
assured by the same informant, that he had known
one of his horses more fatigued after traversing a
dozen miles with a “yokel” (as he called him),
or an incompetent man, than the animal had been
after a fifteen miles’ journey with the same load
under the care of a careful and judicious driver.
This knowledge of the management of a horse is
most essential when men are employed to work
“single-handed,” or have confided to them singly
a horse and cart; when they work in gangs it is
not insisted upon, except as regards the “carman,”
or the man having charge of the horse or
the team.</p>

<p>The master rubbish-carters generally are more
particular than they used to be as to the men
to whom they commit the care of their horses.
It may be easy enough to learn to drive a
horse and cart, but a casual labourer will now
hardly get employment in rubbish-carting of a
“good sort” unless he has attained that preliminary
knowledge. The foreman of one of the
principal contractors said to me, “It would never
do to let a man learn his business by practising on
our horses.” I mention this to show, that although
rubbish-carting is to be classed among unskilled
labours, <i>some</i> training is necessary.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE RUBBISH CARTER.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>I am informed that one-third of the working
rubbish-carters have been rubbish-carters from
their youth, or cart, car, or waggon-drivers, for
they all seem to have known changes; or they
have been used to the care of horses in the capacity
of ostlers, stable-men, helpers, coaching-inn porters,
coachmen, grooms, and horse-breakers. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the remainder, one-half, I am informed, have
“had a turn” at such avocations as scavagery,
bricklayers’ labouring, dock work, railway excavating,
night work, and the many toils to
which such men resort in their struggles to
obtain bread, whatever may have been their
original occupation, which is rarely that of an
artizan. The other, and what may be called
the greater half of the remaining number, is composed
of agricultural labourers who were rubbish-carters
in the country, and of the many men
who have had the care of horses and vehicles
in the provinces, and who have sought the metropolis,
depending upon their thews and sinews
for a livelihood, as porters, or carmen, or labourers
in almost any capacity. The most of these men
at the plough, the harrow, the manure-cart, the
hay and corn harvests, have been practised carters
and horse drivers before they sought the expected
gold in the streets of London. Full a third of
the whole body of rubbish-carters are Irishmen,
who in Ireland were small farmers, or cottiers, or
agricultural labourers, or belonged to some of the
classes I have described.</p>

<p>The mechanics among rubbish-carters I heard
estimated, by men with equal means of information,
as one in twenty and one in fifteen. Among
these <i>quondam</i> mechanics were more farriers,
cart and wheel wrights, than of other classes.</p>

<p>It seems to be regarded as an indispensable
thing that working rubbish-carters should have
one quality&mdash;bodily strength. I am told that one
employer, who died a few weeks ago, used to say
to any applicant for work, “It’s no use asking
for it, if you wish to keep it, unless you can lift
a horse up when he’s down.”</p>

<p>As I have shown of the scavagers, &amp;c., the
employers in rubbish-carting may be classed as
“honourable” and “scurfs.” The men do not
use the word “honourable,” nor any equivalent
term, but speak of their masters, though with no
great distinctiveness, as being either “good,” or
“scurfs.” As in other branches of unskilled labour
where there are no trade societies or general
trade regulations among the operatives, there are
few distinctive appellations.</p>

<p>From the facts I have collected in connection
with this trade, it would appear that there are 180
master rubbish-carters in the metropolis, about
140 of whom pay 18<i>s.</i> or more per week as
wages, while the remaining 40 pay less than that
amount. The latter constitute what the men
term the scurf portion of the trade; so that the
honourable masters among the rubbish-carters may
be said to comprise seven-ninths of the whole.</p>

<p>I will first treat of the circumstances, characteristics,
and wages of the men employed in the
honourable trade.</p>

<p>And first, as regards the <i>division of labour</i>
among the operative rubbish-carters, the work is as
simple as possible.</p>

<p>There <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The Rubbish-Carters</i> proper, or “carmen,”
who are engaged principally in conveying the
refuse brick or earth to the several shoots.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Rubbish-Shovellers</i>, or “gangers,” who
are engaged principally in filling the cart with the
rubbish to be removed. Generally speaking, the
two offices are performed by the same individual,
who is both carter and shoveller, and it is only in
large works that the gangers are employed.</p>

<p>Master builders and others who require the aid
of rubbish-carters for the removal of earth or
any other kind of rubbish from ground about to
be built upon, or from old buildings about to be
repaired or pulled down, either hire horses, carts,
and carmen, by the day, of the master rubbish-carters,
or pay a certain price per load for the
removal of the rubbish. If the job be likely to
last some length of time, the builders pay the
masters so much per load for carting away the
rubbish; but if the job be only for a short period,
the horses, carts, and carmen are hired of the
masters for the time. The price paid to the master
rubbish-carter ranges from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
load for the removal of rubbish and bringing
back such bricks, lime, or sand as may be required
for the building. The master rubbish-carter, in all
cases, pays the men engaged in the removal of the
rubbish.</p>

<p>The operative rubbish-carters (except in a very
few instances) never work in gangs, either in the
construction of new buildings or in old buildings
about to be pulled down or repaired. In digging
the foundations of new houses, the master builders,
or speculators, building upon their own ground
employ their own excavators, and engage rubbish-carters
to remove the refuse earth, the latter being
merely occupied in carting it away.</p>

<p>The principle of simple co-operation or gang-work
occasionally prevails; and, when this is the
case, the gang is employed in shovelling and picking,
while the carman, as the shovellers throw
out the rubbish, fills or shovels the rubbish into
the cart.</p>

<p>Each rubbish-carter will, on an average, convey
away from two to five loads a day, according to
the distance he has to take it. Calculating 850
men to remove four loads per diem for five
months in a year, the gross quantity of rubbish
annually removed would be very nearly 326,000
loads.</p>

<p>In the regular trade <i>the hours of daily labour</i>
are twelve, or from six to six; but the men are
allowed half an hour for breakfast, an hour for
dinner, and half an hour for tea, and almost invariably
leave at half-past five, so postponing the
“tea” half-hour until after the termination of
their work. In winter the hours are generally
“between the lights,” but on very short, dark, or
foggy days, lanterns are used. The men employed
by one firm “often made up,” I was told
by one of them, “for lost time, by shovelling by
moonlight.” The carman, however, has to get to
his stable in the summer at four o’clock in the
morning, and to tend his horse after he has done
work at night; so that the usual hours of labour
with him are fifteen and sixteen per day, as well
as Sunday-work.</p>

<p>The rubbish-carters are <i>paid by week</i>, 18<i>s.</i> to
20<i>s.</i> being the weekly amount; and by <i>the load</i>,
which is indeed piece-work. The payment to the
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
operatives by the load varies from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
for it is necessarily regulated by the distance to
be traversed. If the rubbish have to be carted a
mile to its destination&mdash;or, as the men call it, to
“the shoot”&mdash;of course it is to be so conveyed at
a proportionally lower rate than if it had to be
driven two or three miles. The employment of
men by the load, however, becomes less every
year, and the reason, I am assured, is this:&mdash;The
great stress of the labour falls upon the
horse. If the animal be strong and manageable,
a man, for the sake of conveying an extra load a
day, might overtax its powers, injure it gradually,
and deteriorate its strength and its value. The
operative carters, on their part, have complained
that sometimes even “good” employers have set
them to work by the load with “hard old horses,”
which no management could get out of their slow,
long-accustomed pace. Thus a man might clear
by the piece-work but 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day, with a horse
not worth 15<i>l.</i>; while another carter, with a
superior animal worth twice as much, might clear
3<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Some “hard” masters, I was
informed, liked these old horses, because they
were bought cheap, and though they brought in
less than superior animals they were easier kept;
while if less were earned by the piece-work with
such horses, less was paid in wages; and if the
horse broke its leg, or was killed, or injured, it
was more easily replaced. This mode of employment
is, as I have said, less and less carried into
effect; but it is still one of the ways in which
a working carter may be made a sufferer, because
a principal accessary of his work&mdash;the horse&mdash;may
not be capable of the requisite exertion.</p>

<p><i>The nominal wages</i> of the rubbish-carters in
the best employ are from 18<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> a week; in
the worse-paid trade 15<i>s.</i> is the more general
price; but even as little as 12<i>s.</i> is given by some
masters.</p>

<p><i>The actual wages</i> are the same as the nominal
in the honourable trade, with the addition of
perquisites in beer to the men of from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>
weekly, and of “findings,” especially to the
carmen, of an amount I could not ascertain, but
perhaps realizing 6<i>d.</i> a week. One carman put
all he found on one side to buy new year’s clothes
for his children, and on new year’s eve last year
he had 48<i>s.</i> 0&frac12;<i>d.</i>, “money, and what brought
money;” but this is far from an usual case.</p>

<p>The rate of wages paid to the operative rubbish-carters
throughout the different districts of
London, I find, by inquiries in each locality, to
be by no means uniform. For instance, at
Hampstead the wages are unexceptionally 20<i>s.</i>
per week; while at Kensington, Chelsea, and
indeed the whole of the west districts of London,
they are 18<i>s.</i> weekly; in St. Martin’s
parish, however, 19<i>s.</i> a week is paid by two
masters. In the north districts again, 18s. a
week is generally paid; with the exception of
Hampstead, where the weekly wages for the same
labour are as high as 20<i>s.</i>, and Islington, where
they are as low as 16<i>s.</i> In the central districts,
too, the wages are generally 18<i>s.</i>; the lower rate
of 17<i>s.</i> and 16<i>s.</i> per week being paid in certain
places by “cutting” and “grasping” individuals,
who form isolated exceptions to the rule. In
a certain portion of the eastern districts, such as
Bethnal Green, St. George’s in the East, and
Stepney, 16<i>s.</i> and 15<i>s.</i> a week appears to be the
rule; while in Shoreditch and Poplar 18<i>s.</i> is paid
by all the masters. The southern districts of the
metropolis are equally irregular in their rates of
wages. Lewisham pays as low as 15<i>s.</i>, and
Woolwich the same weekly sum, with one exception.
Wandsworth, on the other hand, pays
uniformly 17<i>s.</i>; while in Southwark, Bermondsey,
Newington, and Camberwell, the wages paid by
all are 18<i>s.</i> In Lambeth as much as 19<i>s.</i> is
given by two masters out of three; whereas, in
Greenwich one master pays 14<i>s.</i>, and the other
even as low as 12<i>s.</i> a week. When I come to
treat of the lower-paid trade, I shall explain the
causes of the above difference as regards wages.</p>

<p>The analysis of the facts I have collected on
this subject is as follows:&mdash;Out of 180 masters,
employing among them 840 men, there <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Hence, three-fourths of the operatives may be
said to receive 18<i>s.</i> weekly, and about one-sixth
16<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>The perquisites</i> in this trade are more in beer
than in money, nor are they derived from the
employers, unless exceptionally. They are given
to the rubbish-carters by the owners of the premises
where they work, and may, in the best
trade, amount, in beer or in money to buy beer, to
from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> weekly per man. The other
perquisites are what is found in the digging of
the rubbish for the carts, and in the shooting
of it. As in other trades of a not dissimilar
character, there appears to be no fixed rule as
to “treasure trove.” One man told me that in
digging or shovelling each man kept what he
found; another said the men drank it. Anything
found, however, when the cart is emptied
is the perquisite of the carman. “It’s luck as is
everything;” said one carman. “There was a mate
of mine as hadn’t not no better work nor me,
once found an old silver coin, like a bad half-crown,
as a gen’lman he knowed gave him five good
shillings for, and he found a silver spoon as fetched
1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, in one week, and that same week on the
same ground <i>I</i> got nothing but five bad ha’pennies.
I once worked in the City where the Sun office
now is, just by the Hall of Commerce in Threadneedle-street,
and something was found in the
Hall as now is; it was a French church once;
and an old gent gave us on the sly 1<i>s.</i> a day for
beer, to show him or tell him of anything we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
turned up queer. We did show him things as
we thought queer, and they looked queer, but he
all’us said ‘Chi-ish,’ or ‘da-amn.’ From what
I’ve heard him say to another old cove as sometimes
was with him, they looked for something
Roman Catholic.” My informant no doubt meant
“Roman,” as in digging the foundations of the
Hall of Commerce a tesselated Roman pavement
was found at a great depth.</p>

<p>Among these workmen are <i>no Trade Societies,
no Benefit or Sick-Clubs</i>, and, indeed, no measures
whatever for the upholding of accustomed wages,
or providing “for a rainy day,” unless individually.
If a rubbish-carter be sick, the men in the
same employ, whatever their number, 10 or 40,
contribute on the Saturday evenings 6<i>d.</i> each,
towards his support, until the patient’s convalescence.
There are no Houses of Call.</p>

<p>The <i>payment is in the master’s yard</i> on the
Saturday evening, and always in money. There
are no drawbacks, unless for any period during
the hours of regular labour, when a man may
have been absent from his work. Fines there are
none, except in large establishments among the
carmen where many horses are kept, and then, if
a man do not keep his regular stable-hours in the
mornings, especially the Sunday mornings, he is
fined 6<i>d.</i> These fines are spent by the carmen
generally, and most frequently in beer.</p>

<p>The <i>usual way of applying for work</i> is to call
at the yards or premises, or, more frequently, to
take a round in the districts where it is known
that buildings or excavations are being carried on,
to inquire of the men if a hand be wanted.
Sometimes a foreman may be there who has
authority to “put on” new hands; if not, the
applicant, with the prospect of an engagement in
view, calls upon any party he may be directed to.
Several men told me that when they were engaged
nothing was said about character. The employers
seem to be much influenced by the applicant’s
appearance.</p>

<p>I must now give a brief description of the
rubbish-carter, and the scene of his labours.</p>

<p>Any one who observes, and does not merely
see, the labour of the rubbish-carter, will have
been struck with the stolid indifference with which
these men go about their work, however much
the scene of their labours, from its historical associations,
may interest the better informed. So it
was when the rubbish carters were employed in
removing the ruins of the old Houses of Parliament,
and of that portion of the Tower which
suffered from the ravages of the fire; and so it
would be if they were directed to-morrow to
commence the demolition and rubbish-carting of
Westminster Abbey, the Temple Church, or St.
Paul’s, even in their present integrity.</p>

<p>Sometimes the scene of the rubbish-carter’s
industry presents what may be called a “piteous
aspect.” This was not long ago the case in
Cannon-street, City, and the adjacent courts and
alleys; when the houses had been cleared of their
furniture, the windows were removed (giving the
house what may be styled a “blind” look); most
of the doors had been taken away, as well as some
of the floors. Large cyphers, scrawled in whitewash
on the walls and woodwork, intimated the
different “lots,” and all spoke of desertion; the
only moving thing to be seen, perhaps, was some
flapping paper, torn from the sides of a room and
which fluttered in the wind.</p>

<p>A scene of exceeding bustle follows the apparent
desolateness of the premises. When the
whole has been disposed of to the several purchasers,
the further and final work of demolition
begins. Baskets filled with the old bricks are
rapidly lowered by ropes and pulleys into the carts
below, it being the carter’s business to empty
them, and then up the empty baskets are drawn,
as if by a single jerk. The sound of the hammer
used in removing and separating the old bricks of
the building, the less frequent sound of the pick-axe,
the rumble of the stones and bricks into the
cart, the noise of the pulleys, the shouts of the
men aloft, crying “be-low there!” the half-articulate
exclamations of the carters choked with
dust, form a curious medley of noises. The atmosphere
is usually a cloud of dust, which sticks to
the men’s hair like powder. The premises are
boarded round, and if adjoining a thoroughfare
the boards are closely fitted, to prevent the curious
and the loiterers obstructing the current of passengers.
The work within is confined to the
labourers; “no persons admitted except on business”
seems a rule rigidly enforced. The only
men inside who appear idle are the over-lookers,
or surveyors. They stand with their hands in their
breeches’ pockets; and a stranger to the business
might account them uninterested spectators, but
for the directions they occasionally give, now
quietly, and now snappishly; while the Irishmen
show an excessive degree of activity, the assumption
of which never deceives an overlooker.</p>

<p>From twelve to one is the customary dinner-hour,
and then all is quiet. On visiting some
new buildings at Maida-hill, I found seven men,
out of about 30, all fast asleep in the nooks and
corners of the piles of bricks and rubbish, the day
being fine. The others were eating their dinners
at the public-houses or at their own homes.</p>

<p>In the progress of pulling down, the work of
removal goes on very rapidly where a strong force
is employed&mdash;the number varying from about
twelve to 30 men. A four-storied house is often
pulled down to its basement, and the contents of the
walls, floors, &amp;c., removed, in ten days or a fortnight.</p>

<p>As the work of demolition goes on, the rubbish-carter
loads the cart with the old bricks, mortar,
and refuse which the labourers have displaced.
In some places, where a number of buildings is
being removed at the same time, an inclined plane
or road is formed by the rubbish-carters, up and
down which the horses and vehicles can proceed.
Until such means of carriage have been employed,
the rubbish from the interior foundation is often
shot in a mound within the premises, and carried
off when the way has been formed, excepting such
portion as may be retained for any purpose.</p>

<p>In hot weather, many of the rubbish-carters in
the fair trade work in their shirts, a broad woollen
belt being strapped round the waist, which, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
say, supports “the small of the back” in their
frequent bending and stooping. Some wear
woollen night-caps at this work when there is
much dust; and nearly all the men in the honourable
trade wear the “strong men’s” half-boots,
laced up in the front, as the best protectors
of the feet from the intrusion of rubbish.</p>

<p>In the cold weather, the rubbish-carter’s working
dress is usually a suit of strong drab-white
fustian. The suit comprises a jacket with two
large pockets. The cost of such a suit, new, at a
slop-tailor’s, is from 28<i>s.</i> to 35<i>s.</i>; from a good
shop, and of better materials, 40<i>s.</i> to 55<i>s.</i> Some
prefer stout corduroy to fustian trowsers; and
some work in short smock-frocks.</p>

<p>Having thus shown the nature of the work,
the class of men employed, and the amount of remuneration,
I proceed to describe the characteristics
of the rubbish-carters employed by the honourable
masters; I will then describe the state of the
labourers who are <i>casually</i> rather than <i>constantly</i>
employed; and finally speak of the condition and
habits of the lower-paid workers under the cheap
masters.</p>

<p><i>The Ability to Read and Write.</i>&mdash;I think I
heard of fewer instances of defective education
among the rubbish-carters than among other
classes of unskilled labourers. The number of
men who could read and not write, I found computed
at about one-half. It appears that the
children of these men are very generally sent to
school, which is certainly a healthful sign as to
the desire of the parents to do justice to their
offspring. As among other classes, I met with
uneducated men who had exaggerated notions
of the advantages of the capability of reading
and writing, and men who possessed such capability
representing it as a worthless acquirement.</p>

<p>The <i>majority of the Rubbish-Carters</i> in the
honourable trade are, I am informed, <i>really
married men</i>, and have families “born in lawful
wedlock.” One decent and intelligent man, to
whom I was referred, said (his wife being present
and confirming his statement): “I don’t know
how it is, sir, but they say one scabbed sheep
will affect a flock.” “Oh! it’s dreadful,” said the
wife; “but some way it seems to run in places.
Now, we’ve lived among people much in our own
way of life in Clerkenwell, and Pentonville, and
Paddington. Well, we’ve reason to believe, that
there wasn’t much living together unmarried in
Clerkenwell or Pentonville, but a goodish deal in
Paddington. I don’t know why, for they seemed
to live one with another, just as men do with their
wives. But if there’s daughters, sir, as is growing
up and gets to know it, as they’re like enough
to do, ain’t it a bad example? Yes, indeed,”
said the wife, “and I’m told they call going
together in that bad way&mdash;they ought all to be
punished&mdash;without ever entering a church or
chapel, getting ‘ready married.’” I inquired if
they were not perhaps married quietly at the
Registrar’s office? “O, that,” said Mrs. <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
“ain’t like being married at all. <i>I</i> would never
have consented to such a way, but I’m pretty
certain they don’t as much as do that. No, sir,” (in
answer to another inquiry), “I hope, and think,
it ain’t so bad among young couples as it was, but
its bad enough as it is, God he knows.” The
proportions of Wedlock and Concubinage I could
not learn, for the woman, I was assured, always
took the man’s name; and both man and woman,
unless in their cups or their quarrels, declared
they were man and wife, only there was no good
in wasting money to get their “marriage lines”
all for no use.</p>

<p><i>The Politics of the rubbish-carters</i> are, I am
assured by some of the best informed among
them, of no fixity, or principle, or inclination
whatever, as regards one-half of the entire body;
and that the other half, whether ignorant or not,
are Chartists, the Irish generally excepted; and
they, I understood, as I had learned on previous
occasions, had no political opinions, unless such as
were entertained by their priests. Strong, rude,
and ignorant as many of these carters are, I am
told that few of them took part in any public
manifestation of opinion, or in any disturbance,
unless they were out of work. “I think I know
them well,” one of their body said to me, “and
as long as they have pretty middling of work,
it’ll take a very great thing indeed to move ’em.
If they was longish out of work and felt a pinch,
very likely they’d be found ready for anything.”</p>

<p><i>With respect to Free Trade</i>, I am told that these
men sometimes discuss it, and formerly discussed it
far more frequently among themselves, but that
it was not above one in a dozen, and of the better
sort only, who cared to talk about it either now
or then. There seems no doubt that the majority,
whether they understand its principles and working
or not, are favourable to it; I may say, from
all I could learn, that the <i>great</i> majority are. I
heard of one rubbish-carter, formerly a small
farmer, who left London for some other employment,
in the spring, contending, and taking pains
to enforce his conviction, that Free Trade would
ruin the best interests of rubbish-carters, as year
by year there would be more agricultural labourers
resorting to the great towns to look for such
work as rubbish-carting, for every farmer would
employ more Irish labourers at his own terms,
and even the 8<i>s.</i> a week, the extent of the earnings
of the agricultural labourers in some parishes,
would be undersold by the Irish. Last winter,
he said, very many countrymen came to London,
and would do so the next, and more and more
every year, and so make labour cheaper.</p>

<p>As far as I could extend my inquiries and
observations, this man’s arguments&mdash;although I
cannot say I heard any one offer to controvert
them&mdash;were not considered sound, nor his facts
fully established. There were certainly great
numbers of good hands out of employment last
winter, and many new applicants for work; “but
buildings,” I was told by a carman, “are of course
always slacker carried on in the winter. Now,
this year, so far (beginning of October), things
seem to promise pretty well in our business, and
so if it’s good this winter and was bad the last,
why, as there’s the same Free Trade, it seems as
if it had nothing to do with it. There’s not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
much building going on now as there was a few
years ago, but trade’s steadier, I think.”</p>

<p>Other rubbish-carters, in the best trade, said
that they had found little difference for six or
eight years, only as bread was cheaper or dearer;
and, if Free Trade made bread cheap, no man
ought to say a word against it, “no matter about
anything else.” Of course I give these opinions
as they came to me.</p>

<p><i>As to Food</i>, these labourers, when in full work,
generally live what they consider <i>well</i>; that is,
they eat meat and have beer to their meals every
day. Three of them told me that they could not
say what their living cost separately, as they took
all their meals at home with their families, their
wives laying out the money. One couple had six
children, and the husband said they cost him
about 17<i>s.</i> a week in food, or about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
head, reckoning a pint of beer a day for himself,
and not including the youngest, which was an
infant at the breast. The father earned 22<i>s.</i>
weekly, and the eldest child, a boy, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week for carrying out and collecting the papers for
a news’-agent. The wife could earn nothing,
although an excellent washerwoman, the cares of
her family occupying her whole time. She always
had “the cold shivers,” she said, “if ever she
thought of John’s being out of work, but he was
a steady man, and had been pretty fortunate.”
If these men were engaged on a job at any
distance, they sometimes breakfasted before starting,
or carried bread and butter with them, and
eat it to a pint of coffee if near enough to a coffee-shop,
but in some places they were not near
enough. Their dinners they carried with them,
generally cold meat and bread, in a basin covered
with a plate, a handkerchief being tied round it
so as to keep the plate firm and afford a hold to
the bearer. “It’s not always, you see, sir,” said
a rubbish-carter, “that there’s a butcher’s shop
near enough to run to and buy a bit of steak and
get it dressed at a tap-room fire, just for buying a
pint of beer, and have a knife and fork, and a
plate, and salt found you into the bargain, and
pepper and mustard too, if you’ll give the girl or
the man 1<i>d.</i> a week or so. But we’re glad to get
a good cold dinner. O, as to beer, it would be a
queer out-of-the-way place indeed where a landlord
didn’t send out a man to a building with beer.”
One single man, who told me he was only a small
eater, gave me the following as his <i>daily</i> bill of
fare, as he rarely took any meals at his lodgings:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="left">Half-quartern loaf</td><td>0</td><td>2&frac34;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Butter</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Coffee (twice a day)</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Eleven o’clock beer, sometimes a pint and sometimes half-a-pint, but often obtained as a perquisite (average)</td><td>0</td><td>1&frac12;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">&frac12; lb. of beef steak, or a chop, or four or five pennyworth of cold meat from a cook-shop (average)</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>This was the average cost of his daily food,
while on Sundays he generally paid 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for
breakfast and tea, and a good dinner off a hot
joint with baked potatoes from the oven, along with
the family and other lodgers. He had a good
walk every Sunday morning, he said, but liked to
sleep away the afternoon. He found his own
Sunday beer, costing 4<i>d.</i> dinner and supper, but
he didn’t eat anything at supper, as he wasn’t
inclined after resting all day, and so his weekly
expenses in food <span class="lock">were:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>To this, in the way of drink or luxuries, I might
add, the carter said, 2<i>d.</i> a day for gin (although
he wasn’t a drinker and was very seldom tipsy),
“for I treat a friend to a quartern one day and
may-be he stands treat the next.” Also 4<i>d.</i> for
Sunday gin, as he and the other men took a glass
just before dinner for an appetite, and he took one
after dinner to send him asleep. Add, too, 3<i>d.</i> a
week for tobacco. In all 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, which swells
the weekly cost of eating, drinking, and smoking
to 13<i>s.</i> 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> His washing was 4<i>d.</i> a week (he
washed his working jacket and trowsers himself),
his rent 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a bed to himself; so that,
16<i>s.</i> 4&frac12;<i>d.</i> being spent out of an earning of 18<i>s.</i>,
he had but 1<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> a week left for his clothes,
shoes, &amp;c. If he wanted a shilling or two for
anything, he said, he knocked off his supper, and
then nothing was allowed in his reckoning for
perquisites, so he might be 2<i>s.</i> in hand, at least 2<i>s.</i>,
every week in a regular way of living. This man
expressed his conviction that no man, who had
to work hard, could live at smaller cost than he
did. That numbers of men did so, he admitted,
but he “couldn’t make it out.” The two ways of
living which I have described may be taken as
the modes prevalent among this class of labourers,
who seek to live “comfortably.” Others who
“rough it” live at less cost, dining, for instance,
off a pennyworth of pudding and half a pint
of beer.</p>

<p>I ascertained that among the rubbish-carters,
<i>those most frequently attendant on public worship
are the Irish Roman Catholics</i>, and such Englishmen
as had been agricultural labourers in rural parishes,
and had been reared in the habit of church-going;
a habit in which, but not without many exceptions,
they still persevere. Among London-bred
labourers such habits are rarely formed.</p>

<p><i>The abodes of the better description of rubbish-carters</i>
are not generally in those localities which
are crowded with the poor. They reside in the
streets off the Edgeware and Harrow-roads, as
building has been carried on to a very great extent
in Westbourne, Maida-hill, &amp;c.; in Portland-town,
Camden-town, Somers-town, about King’s-cross;
in Islington, Pentonville, and Clerkenwell;
off the Commercial and Mile-end-roads; in
Walworth, Camberwell, Kennington, and Newington;
and, indeed, in all the quarters where
building has been prosecuted on an extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
scale. I was in some of their apartments, and
found them tidy and comfortable-looking: one was
especially so. Some stone-fruit on the mantel-shelf
shone as if newly painted, and the fender
and fire-irons glittered from their brightness to
the fire of the small grate. The husband, however,
was in good earnings, and the wife cleared
about 5<i>s.</i> weekly on superior needlework. There
was one thing painful to observe&mdash;the contrast
between the robust and sun-burnt look of the
husband, and the delicate and pallid, not to say
sickly, appearance of the wife. The rents for
unfurnished apartments vary from 2<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, but
rarely the latter, unless the wife take in a little
washing. I heard of some at 2<i>s.</i>, but very few;
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> are common prices.</p>

<p><i>I heard of no partiality for amusements among
the rubbish-carters</i>, beyond what my informant
spoke of&mdash;a visit to the play. Some, I was told,
but principally the younger men, never missed
going to a fair, which was not too far off. I think
not quite one-half of those I spoke to, with the
best earnings, had been to the Exhibition. Of the
worst paid, I am told, not one in 50 went; one man
told me that he had no amusements but his pipe
and his beer. Some of them, I was assured, drank
half a gallon of beer in a day, but at intervals, so
as not to be intoxicated. “A hand at cribbage”
is a favourite public-house game among a few of
these men; but not above one in half-a-dozen, I
was assured, “knew the cards,” and not one in two
dozen played them.</p>

<p>These, then, are the characteristics of the
labouring rubbish-carters employed in the honourable
trade.</p>

<p>A fine-looking man, upwards of six feet in
stature and of proportionate bulk, with so smart
a set to his bushy whiskers, and a look of such
general tidiness (after he had left off work in the
evening), that he might have been taken for a life-guardsman
had it not been for a slight slouch of
the shoulders, and a very unmilitary gait, gave
me the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’m a London man,” he said, “and though
I’m not yet 25, I’ve kept myself for the last
five years. I’ve worked at rubbish-carting and
general ground-work (digging for pipe-laying, &amp;c.,)
as we nearly all do, but mainly at rubbish-carting,
and I’m at that now. My friends are in the
same line, so I helped them: I was big enough,
and was brought up that way. O, yes, I can
read and write, but I haven’t time, or very
seldom, to read anything but a newspaper now
and again. I’m a carman now, and have
a very good master. I’ve served him, more
or less, for three years. I have had 25<i>s.</i> a week,
and I have had 29<i>s.</i>, but that included over-work.
Two hours extra work a day makes an extra day
in the week, you see, sir. O, yes, I might have
saved money, and I’m trying to save 25<i>l.</i> now to
see if I can’t raise a horse and cart, and begin for
myself in a small way, general jobbing. I’ve
been used to cart mould, and gravel, and turf for
gentlemen’s gardens, or when gardens have been
laid out in new buildings, as well as rubbish, for
the same master. Last year I set to work in
hard earnest in the same way, and this is where
it is that always stops me. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; [his employer]
is very busy now, and things look pretty
well about here [Camden-town], but I don’t
know how it is in other parts. It was the same
last year, but trade fell off in the winter, and I
was three months out of work. O, that’s a
common case, especial with young men, for of
course the old hands has the preference. That’s
where it is, you see, sir; it’s a <i>uncertain</i> trade.
It’s always that new shoes is wanted, but it
ain’t always new houses. My money all went,
and then all my things went to the pawn, and
when I got fairly to work again, I had a shirt
and a shilling left, and owed some little matters.
I’d saved well on to 50<i>s.</i>, and could have gone on
saving, but for being thrown out. Then, when
you get into regular wages again, there’s your
uncle to meet, and there’s always something
wanted&mdash;a pair of half-boots, or a new shirt, or a
new tool, or something; so one loses heart about
it, and I can’t abear not to appear respectable.</p>

<p>“I pay 2<i>s.</i> a week for my lodging, but it’s
only for half a bed. The house is let out that
way to single men like me, so each bed brings in
4<i>s.</i> a week. There’s two beds in the room where
I sleep; I don’t know how many in all. Why,
yes, it’s a respectable sort of a place, but I don’t
much like it. There’s plenty such places; some’s
decent and some’s not. Oh, certainly, a place of
your own’s best, if it’s ever so humble, but it
wouldn’t suit a man like me. I may work one
week at Paddington, and the next at Bow, and if
I had a furnished room at Paddington, what good
would it be if I went to work at Bow? Only the
bother and expense of removing my sticks again
and again. O, people that find lodgings for such
as me, know that well enough, and makes a prey
of us, of course.</p>

<p>“I take my meals at a public-house or a coffee-shop.
O yes, I live well enough. I have meat
every day to dinner; a man like me must keep up
his strength, and you can’t do that without good
meat. It’s all nonsense about vegetables and all
that, as if men’s stomachs were like cows’. I
have bread and butter and tea or coffee for breakfast
and tea, sometimes a few cresses with it just
to sweeten the blood, which is the proper use of
vegetables. A pint of beer or so for supper, but
I don’t care about supper, though now and then I
take a bit of bread and cheese with a nice fresh
onion to it. Well, I’m sure I can’t say what I
lay out in my living in a week; sometimes more
and sometimes less. I keep no account; I pay
my way as I go on. Some weeks when I get
my Saturday night’s wage, I have from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> left from last Saturday night’s money, but
that’s only when I’ve had nothing to lay out
beyond common. Now, last week I was 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
to the good, and this week I shall be about the
ditto; but then I want a waistcoat and a silk
handkerchief for my neck for Sunday wear; so I
must draw on my Saturday night. There’s a
gentleman takes care of my money for me, and I
carry him what I have over in a week, and he
takes care of it for me. I did a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
work about his houses&mdash;he has a block of them&mdash;and
his own place, and I’ve gardened for him;
and from what I’ve heard, my money’s safer with
him than with a Savings’ Bank. When I want to
draw he likes to be satisfied what it’s for, and
he’s lent me as much as 33<i>s.</i> in different sums,
when I was hard up. He’s what I call a real
gentleman. He says if I ever go to him tipsy to
draw, and says it quite solemn like, he’ll take
me by the scruff of the neck and kick me out;
though [laughing] he can’t be much above five
foot, and has gray hairs, and seems a feeble sort
of a man, I mean of a gentleman. He enters all
I pay in a book. Here it is, sir, for this year, if
you’d like to see it. I wasn’t able to put anything
by for a goodish bit. I lost my book once, but I
knew how much, and so did Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and he put
it down in a lump.</p>

<p>“If I can’t save a little to start myself on when
I’m a single man, I can’t ever after, I fancy; so
I’m a trying.</p>

<p>“No, my expenses, over and above my living
and lodging and washing, and all that, ain’t heavy.
Yes, I’m very fond of a good play, very. Some
galleries is 6<i>d.</i>, and some 3<i>d.</i>; but then there’s
refreshment and that, so it costs 1<i>s.</i> a time. Perhaps
I go once a week, but only in autumn and
winter, when nights get long, and we leave work
at half-past five. The last time I was at the play
was at the Marylebone, but there was some opera
pieces that don’t suit me; such stuff and nonsense.
I like something very lively, or else a deep
tragedy. Sadler’s Wells is the place, sir. I
mean to go there to-morrow night. Yes, I’m
very fond of the pantomimes. Concerts I’ve been
at, but don’t care for them. They’re as dear at
2<i>d.</i> as an egg a penny, and an egg’s only a bite.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve gone to church sometimes, but a
carman hasn’t time, for he has his horses to attend
to on Sunday mornings, and that uses up his morning.
No, I never go now. Work must be done.
It ain’t my fault. I’m sure, if I could have my
wish, I’d never do anything on a Sunday.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s far too many as undersells us in
work. I know that, but I don’t like to think
about them or to talk about them.” [He seemed
desirous to ignore the very existence of the scurf
rubbish-carters.] “They’re Irish many of them.
They’re often quarrelsome and blood-thirsty, but
I know many decent men among the Irishmen in
our gangs. There’s good and bad among them,
as there is among the English. There’s very few
of the Irish that are carmen; they haven’t been
much used to horses.</p>

<p>“I have done a little as a nightman when I
worked for Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. He was a parish contractor,
and undertook such jobs, and liked to put
strong men on to them. I didn’t like it. I can’t
think it’s a healthy trade. I can’t say, but I
heard it represented, that in this particular calling
there was a great deal of under-contracting going
on when the railway undertakings generally received
a severe check, and when a great number
of hands were thrown out of employment, and
sought employment in rubbish-carting generally,
and apart from railway-work. These hands suffered
greatly for a long time. The tommy-shops
and the middle-man system were enough to
swallow the largest amount of railway wages, so
that very few had saved money, and they were
willing to work for very low wages. A good
many of these people went to endeavour to find
work at the large new docks being erected at
Great Grimsby, near Boston, in Lincolnshire.
Some of the more prudent were able to raise the
means of emigrating, and from one cause or other
the pressure of this surplus labour among rubbish-carters
and excavators, as regards the metropolis,
became relieved.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Casual Labour in General, and that of
the Rubbish-Carters in Particular.</span></h3>

<p>The subject of casual labour is one of such vast
importance in connection with the welfare of a
nation and its people, and one of which the causes
as well as consequences seem to be so utterly
ignored by economical writers and unheeded by the
public, that I purpose here saying a few words upon
the matter in general, with the view of enabling
the reader the better to understand the difficulties
that almost all unskilled and many skilled
labourers have to contend with in this country.</p>

<p>By <i>casual</i> labour I mean such labour as can
obtain only <i>occasional</i> as contradistinguished from
<i>constant</i> employment. In this definition I include
all classes of workers, literate and illiterate, skilled
and unskilled, whose professions, trades, or callings
expose them to be employed temporarily rather
than continuously, and whose incomes are in a consequent
degree fluctuating, casual, and uncertain.</p>

<p>In no country in the world is there such an
extent, and at the same time such a diversity,
of casual labour as in Great Britain. This is
attributable to many causes&mdash;commercial and agricultural,
natural and artificial, controllable and
uncontrollable.</p>

<p>I will first show what are the causes of casual
labour, and then point out its effects.</p>

<p>The causes of casual labour may be grouped
under two <span class="lock">heads:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul><li>I. <i>The Brisk and Slack Seasons, and Fit
Times</i>, or periodical increase and decrease of work
in certain occupations.</li>

<li>II. <i>The Surplus Hands</i> appertaining to the different
trades.</li></ul>


<p>First, as to the briskness or slackness of employment
in different occupations. This depends
in different trades on different causes, among which
may be <span class="lock">enumerated&mdash;</span></p>

<ul><li>A. The weather.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>B. The seasons of the year.</li>

<li>C. The fashion of the day.</li>

<li>D. Commerce and accidents.</li></ul>


<p>I shall deal with each of these causes <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>A. The labour of thousands is influenced by
the <i>weather</i>; it is suspended or prevented in many
instances by stormy or rainy weather; and in
some few instances it is promoted by such a state
of things.</p>

<p>Among those whose labour cannot be executed
on <i>wet days</i>, or executed but imperfectly, and
who are consequently deprived of their ordinary
means of living on such days, are&mdash;paviours,
pipe-layers, bricklayers, painters of the exteriors
of houses, slaters, fishermen, watermen (plying
with their boats for hire), the crews of the river
steamers, a large body of agricultural labourers
(such as hedgers, ditchers, mowers, reapers,
ploughmen, thatchers, and gardeners), costermongers
and all classes of street-sellers (to a great
degree), street-performers, and showmen.</p>

<p>With regard to the degree in which agricultural
(or indeed in this instance woodland) labour may
be influenced by the weather, I may state that a
few years back there had been a fall of oaks on an
estate belonging to Col. Cradock, near Greta-bridge,
and the poor people, old men and women, in the
neighbourhood, were selected to strip off the bark
for the tanners, under the direction of a person
appointed by the proprietor: for this work they
were paid by the basket-load. The trees lay in an
open and exposed situation, and the rain was so
incessant that the “barkers” could scarcely do any
work for the whole of the first week, but kept
waiting under the nearest shelter in the hopes
that it would “clear up.” In the first week of
this employment nearly one-third of the poor persons,
who had commenced their work with eagerness,
had to apply for some temporary parochial
relief. A rather curious instance this, of a parish
suffering from the casualty of a very humble
labour, and actually from the attempt of the poor
to earn money, and do work prepared for them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some few classes may be
said to be benefited by the rain which is impoverishing
others: these are cabmen (who are
the busiest on <i>showery</i> days), scavagers, umbrella-makers,
clog and patten-makers. I was told by
the omnibus people that their vehicles filled better
in hot than in wet weather.</p>

<p>But the labour of thousands is influenced also
by the <i>wind</i>; an easterly wind prevailing for a
few days will throw out of employment 20,000
dock labourers and others who are dependent on
the shipping for their employment; such as lumpers,
corn-porters, timber-porters, ship-builders, sail-makers,
lightermen, watermen, and, indeed, almost
all those who are known as ’long-shoremen. The
same state of things prevails at Hull, Bristol,
Liverpool, and all our large ports.</p>

<p><i>Frost</i>, again, is equally inimical to some labourers’
interests; the frozen-out market-gardeners are
familiar to almost every one, and indeed all those
who are engaged upon the land may be said to be
deprived of work by severely cold weather.</p>

<p>In the weather alone, then, we find a means of
starving thousands of our people. Rain, wind,
and frost are many a labourer’s natural enemies,
and to those who are fully aware of the influence
of “the elements” upon the living and comforts
of hundreds of their fellow-creatures, the changes
of weather are frequently watched with a terrible
interest. I am convinced that, altogether, a wet
day deprives not less than 100,000, and probably
nearer 200,000 people, including builders, bricklayers,
and agricultural labourers, of their ordinary
means of subsistence, and drives the same
number to the public-houses and beer-shops (on
this part of the subject I have collected some
curious facts); thus not only decreasing their income,
but positively increasing their expenditure,
and that, perhaps, in the worst of ways.</p>

<p>Nor can there be fewer dependent on the
winds for their bread. If we think of the vast
number employed either directly or indirectly at
the various ports of this country, and then remember
that at each of these places the prevalence of
a particular wind must prevent the ordinary arrival
of shipping, and so require the employment
of fewer hands; we shall have some idea of
the enormous multitude of men in this country
who can be starved by “a nipping and an
eager air.” If in London alone there are 20,000
people deprived of food by the prevalence of an
easterly wind (and I had the calculation from one
of the principal officers of the St. Katherine Dock
Company), surely it will not be too much to say
that throughout the country there are not less
than 50,000 people whose living is thus precariously
dependent.</p>

<p>Altogether I am inclined to believe, that we shall
not be over the truth if we assert there are
between 100,000 and 200,000 individuals and
their families, or half a million of people, dependent
on the elements for their support in this
country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But this calculation refers to those classes only
who are deprived of a certain number of <i>days’</i>
work by an alteration of the weather, a cause
that is essentially <i>ephemeral</i> in its character. The
other series of natural events influencing the
demand for labour in this country are of a more
<i>continuous</i> nature&mdash;the stimulus and the depression
enduring for weeks rather than days. I allude
to the <i>second</i> of the four circumstances above-mentioned
as inducing briskness or slackness of
employment in different occupations, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>B. The seasons.</p>

<p>These are the seasons of the year, and not the
arbitrary seasons of fashion, of which I shall speak
next.</p>

<p>The following classes are among those exposed
to the uncertainty of employment, and consequently
of income, from the above cause, since
it is only in particular seasons that particular
works, such as buildings, will be undertaken, or
that open-air pleasure excursions will be attempted:
carpenters, builders, brickmakers, painters, plasterers,
paper-hangers, rubbish-carters, sweeps, and
riggers and lumpers, the latter depending mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
on the arrival of the timber ships to the Thames
(and this, owing to the ice in the Baltic Sea and
in the river St. Lawrence, &amp;c., takes place only at
certain seasons of the year), coal-whippers and
coal-porters (the coal trade being much brisker
in winter), market-porters, and those employed
in summer in steam-boat, railway, van, and barge
excursions.</p>

<p>Then there are the casualties attending agricultural
labour, for, although the operations of nature
are regular “even as the seed time follows the
harvest,” there is, almost invariably, a smaller
employment of labour after the completion of
the haymaking, the sheep-shearing, and the grain-reaping
labours.</p>

<p>For the hay and corn harvests it is well known
that there is a periodical immigration of Irishmen
and women, who clamour for the <i>casual</i> employment;
others, again, leave the towns for the same
purpose; the same result takes place also in the
fruit and pea-picking season for the London green-markets;
while in the winter such people return
some to their own country, and some to form a
large proportion of the casual class in the metropolis.
A tall Irishman of about 34 or 35 (whom
I had to see when treating of the religion of the
street Irish) leaves his accustomed crossing-sweeping
at all or most of the seasons I have mentioned,
and returns to it for the winter at the
end of October; while his wife and children are
then so many units to add to the casualties of the
street sale of apples, nuts, and onions, by overstocking
the open-air markets.</p>

<p>The autumnal season of hop-picking is the grand
rendezvous for the vagrancy of England and Ireland,
the stream of London vagrancy flowing freely
into Kent at that period, and afterwards flowing
back with increased volume. Men, women, and
children are attracted to the hop harvest. The
season is over in less than a month, and then the
casual labourers engaged in it (and they are
nearly all casual labourers) must divert their industry,
or their endeavours for a living, into other
channels, swelling the amount of casualty in unskilled
work or street-trade.</p>

<p>Numerically to estimate the influence of the
seasons on the labour-market of this country is
almost an overwhelming task. Let us try, however:
there are in round numbers one million
agricultural labourers in this country; saying that
in the summer four labourers are employed for
every three in the winter, there would be 250,000
people and their families, or say 1,000,000 of
individuals, deprived of their ordinary subsistence
in the winter time; this, of course, does not
include those who come from Ireland to assist
at the harvest-getting&mdash;how many these may be
I have no means of ascertaining. Added to these
there are the natural vagabonds, whom I have
before estimated at another hundred thousand
(see p. 408, vol. i.), and who generally help at
the harvest work or the fruit or hop-picking.</p>

<p>Then there are the carpenters, who are 163,000
in number; the builders, 9200; the brickmakers,
18,000; the painters, 48,200; the coal-whippers,
9200; the coal-miners, 110,000; making altogether
350,000 people, and estimating that for every
four hands employed in the brisk season, there
are only three required in the slack, we have
80,000 more families, or 300,000 people, deprived
of their living by the casualty of labour; so that
if we assert that there are, at the least, including
agricultural labourers, 1,250,000 people thus deprived
of their usual means of living, we shall not
be very wide of the truth.</p>

<p>The next cause of the briskness or slackness of
different employments <span class="lock">is&mdash;</span></p>

<p>C. Fashion.</p>

<p>The London fashionable season is also the parliamentary
season, and is the “briskest” from
about the end of February to the middle of July.</p>

<p>The workmen most affected by the aristocratic,
popular, or general fashions, <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Tailors, ladies’ habit-makers, boot and shoe-makers,
hatters, glovers, milliners, dress-makers,
mantua-makers, drawn and straw bonnet-makers,
artificial flower-makers, plumassiers, stay-makers,
silk and velvet weavers, saddlers, harness-makers,
coach-builders, cabmen, job-coachmen, farriers,
livery stable keepers, poulterers, pastry-cooks, confectioners,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned classes may be taken,
according to the Occupation Abstract of the last
Census, at between 500,000 and 600,000; and,
assuming the same ratio as to the difference of
employment between the brisk and the slack
seasons of the trades, or, in other words, that
25 per cent. less hands are required at the slack
than at the brisk time of these trades, we have
another 150,000 people, who, with their families,
may be estimated altogether at say 500,000, who
are thrown out of work at a certain season, and
have to starve on as best they can for at least
three months in the year.</p>

<p>The last-mentioned of the causes inducing
briskness or slackness of employment <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<p>D. Commerce and Accidents.</p>

<p><i>Commerce</i> has its periodical fits and starts.
The publishers, for instance, have their season,
generally from October to March, as people read
more in winter than in summer; and this arrangement
immediately effects the printers and bookbinders;
there is no change, however, as regards the
newspapers and periodicals. Again, the early importation
to this country of the new foreign fruits
gives activity to the dock and wharf labourers and
porters and carmen. Thus the arrival here, generally
in autumn, of the nut, chestnut, and grape (raisin)
produce of Spain; of the almond crops in Portugal,
Spain, and Barbary; the date harvest in Morocco,
and different parts of Africa; the orange gathering
in Madeira, and in St. Michael’s, Terceira,
and other islands of the Azores; the fig harvest
from the Levant; the plum harvest of the south
of France; the currant picking of Zante, Ithaca,
and other Ionian Islands;&mdash;all these events give an
activity, as new fruit is always most saleable, to
the traders in these southern productions; and
more shopmen, shop-porters, wharf labourers, and
assistant lightermen are required&mdash;casually required&mdash;for
the time.</p>

<p>I was told by a grocer, with a country connec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>tion,
and in a large way of business, that for
three weeks or a month before Christmas he required
the aid of four fresh hands, a shopman, an
errand-boy, and two porters (one skilled in packing),
for whom he had nothing to do after Christmas.
If in the wide sweep of London trade there
be 1000 persons, including the market salesmen,
the retail butchers, the carriers, &amp;c., so circumstanced,
then 4000 men are <i>casually</i> employed,
and for a very brief time.</p>

<p>The brief increase of the carrying business generally
about Christmas, by road, water, or railway,
is sufficiently indicated by the foregoing account.</p>

<p>The employment, again, in the cotton and woollen
manufacturing districts may be said to depend for
its briskness on commerce rather than on the
seasons.</p>

<p><i>Accidents</i>, or extraordinary social events, promote
casual labour and then depress it. Often
they depress without having promoted it.</p>

<p>During the display of the Great Exhibition,
there were some thousands employed in the different
capacities of police, packing, cleaning, porterage,
watching, interpreting, door-keeping and
money-taking, cab-regulating, &amp;c.; and after the
close of the Exhibition how many were retained?
Thus the Great Exhibition fostered casual, or uncertain
labour. Foreign revolutions, moreover,
affect the trade of England: speculators become
timid and will not embark in trade or in any
proposed undertaking; the foreign import and
export trades are paralysed; and fewer clerks
and fewer labourers are employed. Home political
agitations, also, have the same effect; as
was seen in London during the corn-law riots,
about 35 years ago (when only eight members of
the House of Commons supported a change in
those laws); the Spafields riots in 1817; the
affair in St. Peter’s-field, Manchester, in 1819;
the disturbances and excitement during the trial
of Queen Caroline, in 1820-1, and the loss of life
on the occasion of her funeral in 1821; the agitation
previously to the passing of the Reform Bill
had a like effect; the meeting on Kennington
Common on the 10th of April;&mdash;in all these
periods, indeed, employment decreased. Labour is
affected also by the death of a member of the
royal family, and the hurried demand for general
mourning, but in a very small degree to what was
once the case. A West-End tailor employing a
great number of hands did not receive a single
order for mourning on the death of Queen Adelaide;
while on the demise of the Princess Charlotte
(in 1817) thousands of operative tailors, throughout
the three kingdoms, worked day and night,
and for double wages, on the general mourning.
Gluts in the markets, an increase of heavy bankruptcies
and “panics,” such as were experienced
in the money market in 1825-6, and again in
1846, with the failure of banks and merchants,
likewise have the effect of augmenting the mass
of casual labour; for capitalists and employers,
under such circumstances, expend as little as
possible in wages or employment until the storm
blows over. Bad harvests have a similar depressing
effect.</p>

<p>There are also the consequences of changes of
taste. The abandonment of the fashions of gentlemen’s
wearing swords, as well as embroidered
garments, flowing periwigs, large shoe-buckles,
all reduced able artizans to poverty by depriving
them of work. So it was, when, to carry on
the war with France, Mr. Pitt introduced a tax
on hair powder. Hundreds of hair-dressers were
thrown out of employment, many persons abandoning
the fashion of wearing powder rather than
pay the tax. There are now city gentlemen, who
can remember that when clerks, they had sometimes
to wait two or three hours for “their turn”
at a barber’s shop on a Sunday morning; for they
could not go abroad until their hair was dressed
and powdered, and their queues trimmed to the
due standard of fashion. So it has been, moreover,
in modern times in the substitution of silk
for metal buttons, silk hats for stuff, and in the
supersedence of one material of dress by another.</p>

<p>These several causes, then, which could only
exist in a community of great wealth and great
poverty have rendered, and are continually rendering,
the labour market uncertain and over-stocked;
to what extent they do and have done this,
it is, of course, almost impossible to say <i>precisely</i>;
but, even with the strongest disposition to avoid
exaggeration, we may assert that there are in this
country no less than 125,000 families, or 500,000
people, who depend on the weather for their food;
300,000 families, or 1,250,000 people, who can
obtain employment only at particular seasons;
150,000 more families, or 500,000 people, whose
trade depends upon the fashionable rather than
the natural seasons, are thrown out of work at the
cessation of the brisk time of their business; and,
perhaps, another 150,000 of families, or 500,000
people, dependent on the periodical increase and
decrease of commerce, and certain social and political
accidents which tend to cause a greater or less
demand for labour. Altogether we may assert,
with safety, that there are at the least 725,000
families, or three millions of men, women, and
children, whose means of living, far from being
certain and constant, are of a precarious kind,
depending either upon the rain, the wind, the
sunshine, the caprice of fashion, or the ebbings
and flowings of commerce.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But there is a still more potent cause at work
to increase the amount of <i>casual</i> labour in this
country. Thus far we have proceeded on the
assumption that at the brisk season of each trade
there is full employment for all; but this is far
from being the case in the great majority, if not
the whole, of the instances above cited. In almost
all occupations there is in this country a <i>superfluity
of labourers</i>, and this alone would tend to
render the employment of a vast number of the
hands of a casual rather than a regular character.
In the generality of trades the calculation is
that one-third of the hands are fully employed,
one-third partially, and one-third unemployed
throughout the year. This, of course, would
be the case if there were twice too many work-people;
for suppose the number of work-people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
a given trade to be 6000, and the work sufficient
to employ (fully) only half the quantity, then,
of course, 2000 might be occupied their whole
time, 2000 more might have work sufficient to
occupy them half their time, and the remaining
2000 have no work at all; or the whole 4000 might,
on the average, obtain three months’ employment
out of the twelve; and this is frequently the case.
Hence we see that a surplusage of hands in a trade
tends to change the employment of the great
majority from a state of constancy and regularity
into one of casualty and precariousness.</p>

<p>Consequently it becomes of the highest importance
that we should endeavour to ascertain what are
the circumstances inducing a surplusage of hands
in the several trades of the present day. A <i>surplusage
of hands</i> in a trade may proceed from
three different causes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>1. The alteration of the hours, rate, or mode
of working, or else the term of hiring.</li>

<li>2. The increase of the hands themselves.</li>

<li>3. The decrease of the work.</li></ul>


<p>Each of these causes is essentially distinct; in
the first case there is neither an increase in the
number of hands nor a decrease in the quantity of
work, and yet a surplusage of labourers is the
consequence, for it is self-evident that if there be
work enough in a given trade to occupy 6000
men all the year round, labouring twelve hours per
day for six days in the week, the same quantity
of work will afford occupation to only 4000 men,
or one-third less, labouring between fifteen and
sixteen hours per diem for seven days in the week.
The same result would, of course, take place, if
the workman were made to labour one-third more
<i>quickly</i>, and so to get through one-third more work
in the same time (either by increasing their interest
in their work, by the invention of a new tool,
by extra supervision, or by the subdivision of
labour, &amp;c., &amp;c.), the same result would, of course,
ensue as if they laboured one-third longer hours,
viz., one-third of the hands must be thrown out
of employment. So, again, by altering the <i>mode
or form of work</i>, as by producing on the large
scale, instead of the small, a smaller number of
labourers are required to execute the same amount
of work; and thus (if the market for such work be
necessarily limited) a surplusage of labourers is
the result. Hence we see that the alteration of
the hours, rate, or mode of working may tend as
positively to overstock a country with labourers
as if the labourers themselves had unduly increased.</p>

<p>But this, of course, is on the assumption that both
the quantity of work and the number of hands
remain the same. The next of the three causes,
above mentioned as inducing a surplusage of hands,
is that which arises from a positive <i>increase in the
number of labourers</i>, while the quantity of work remains
the same or increases at a less rate than the
labourers; and the third cause is, where the surplusage
of labourers arises not from any alteration
in the number of hands, but from a positive
<i>decrease in the quantity of work</i>.</p>

<p>These are distinctions necessary to be borne
clearly in mind for the proper understanding of this
branch of the subject.</p>

<p>In the first case both the number of hands
and the quantity of work remain the same, but
the term, rate, or mode of working is changed.</p>

<p>In the second, hours, rate, or mode of
working remain the same, as well as the quantity
of work, but the number of hands is increased.</p>

<p>And in the third case, neither the number of
hands nor the hours, rate, or mode of working is
supposed to have been altered, but the work only
to have decreased.</p>

<p>The surplusage of hands will, of course, be the
same in each of these cases.</p>

<p>I will begin with the first, viz., that which induces
a surplusage of labourers in a trade by
enabling fewer hands to get through the ordinary
amount of work. This is what is called the
“economy of labour.”</p>

<p>There are, of course, only three modes of economizing
labour, or causing the same quantity of
work to be done by a smaller number of hands.</p>

<p>1st. By causing the men to work <i>longer</i>.</p>

<p>2nd. By causing the men to work <i>quicker</i>, and
so get through more work in the same time.</p>

<p>3rd. By <i>altering the mode</i> of work, or hiring,
as in the “large system of production,” where
fewer hands are required; or the custom of temporary
hirings, where the men are retained only
so long as their services are needed, and discharged
immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>First, of that mode of economizing labour which
depends on an <i>increase of either the ordinary
hours or days for work</i>. This is what is usually
termed over-work and Sunday-work, both of
which are largely creative of surplus hands. The
hours of labour in mechanical callings are usually
twelve, two of them devoted to meals, or 72 hours
(less by the permitted intervals) in a week. In
the course of my inquiries for the <i>Chronicle</i>, I
met with slop cabinet-makers, tailors, and milliners
who worked sixteen hours and more daily, their
toil being only interrupted by the necessity of
going out, if small masters, to purchase materials,
and offer the goods for sale; or, if journeymen
in the slop trade, to obtain more work and carry
what was completed to the master’s shop. They
worked on Sundays also; one tailor told me that
the coat he worked at on the previous Sunday
was for the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who “little thought
it,” and these slop-workers rarely give above a
few minutes to a meal. Thus they toil 40 hours
beyond the hours usual in an honourable trade
(112 hours instead of 72), in the course of a week,
or between three and four days of the regular
hours of work of the six working days. In other
words, two such men will in less than a week accomplish
work which should occupy three men a
full week; or 1000 men will execute labour fairly
calculated to employ 1500 at the least. A paucity
of employment is thus caused among the general
body, by this system of over-labour decreasing the
share of work accruing to the several operatives,
and so adding to surplus hands.</p>

<p>Of over-work, as regards excessive labour, both
in the general and fancy cabinet trade, I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the following accounts, which different operatives
concurred in giving; while some represented the
labour as of longer duration by at least an hour,
and some by two hours, a day, than I have stated.</p>

<p>The labour of the men who depend entirely on
“the slaughter-houses” for the purchase of their
articles is usually seven days a week the year
through. That is, seven days&mdash;for Sunday work
is all but universal&mdash;each of 13 hours, or 91
hours in all; while the established hours of
labour in the “honourable trade” are six days of
the week, each of 10 hours, or 60 hours in all.
Thus 50 per cent. is added to the extent of the
production of low-priced cabinet-work, merely
from “over-hours;” but in some cases I heard of
15 hours for seven days in the week, or 105 hours
in all.</p>

<p>Concerning the hours of labour in this trade, I
had the following minute particulars from a
garret-master who was a chair-<span class="lock">maker:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I work from six every morning to nine at
night; some work till ten. My breakfast at eight
stops me for ten minutes. I can breakfast in less
time, but it’s a rest; my dinner takes me say
twenty minutes at the outside; and my tea, eight
minutes. All the rest of the time I’m slaving at
my bench. How many minutes’ rest is that, sir?
Thirty-eight; well, say three-quarters of an hour,
and that allows a few sucks at a pipe when I
rest; but I can smoke and work too. I have
only one room to work and eat in, or I should
lose more time. Altogether I labour 14&frac14; hours
every day, and I must work on Sundays&mdash;at
least 40 Sundays in the year. One may as well
work as sit fretting. But on Sundays I only
work till it’s dusk, or till five or six in summer.
When it’s dusk I take a walk. I’m not well-dressed
enough for a Sunday walk when it’s
light, and I can’t wear my apron on that day very
well to hide patches. But there’s eight hours
that I reckon I take up every week one with
another, in dancing about to the slaughterers.
I’m satisfied that I work very nearly 100 hours
a week the year through; deducting the time
taken up by the slaughterers, and buying stuff&mdash;say
eight hours a week&mdash;it gives more than 90
hours a week for my work, and there’s hundreds
labour as hard as I do, just for a crust.”</p>

<p>The East-end turners generally, I was informed,
when inquiring into the state of that trade,
labour at the lathe from six o’clock in the morning
till eleven and twelve at night, being 18 hours’
work per day, or 108 hours per week. They
allow themselves two hours for their meals. It
takes them, upon an average, two hours more
every day fetching and carrying their work home.
Some of the East-end men work on Sundays, and
not a few either, said my informant. “Sometimes
I have worked hard,” said one man, “from six
one morning till four the next, and scarcely had
any time to take my meals in the bargain. I
have been almost suffocated with the dust flying
down my throat after working so many hours
upon such heavy work too, and sweating so much.
It makes a man drink where he would not.”</p>

<p>This system of over-work exists in the “slop”
part of almost every business&mdash;indeed, it is the
principal means by which the cheap trade is
maintained. Let me cite from my letters in the
<i>Chronicle</i> some more of my experience on this
subject. As regards the London mantua-makers,
I said:&mdash;“The workwomen for good shops that
give fair, or tolerably fair wages, and expect
good work, can make six average-sized mantles
in a week, <i>working from ten to twelve hours a
day</i>; but the slop-workers, by toiling from thirteen
to sixteen hours a day, will make <i>nine</i>
such sized mantles in a week. In a season
of twelve weeks 1000 workers for the slop-houses
and warehouses would at this rate
make 108,000 mantles, or 36,000 more than
workers for the fair trade. Or, to put it in
another light, these slop-women, by being compelled,
in order to live, to work such over-hours
as inflict lasting injury on the health, supplant, by
their over-work and over-hours, the labour of 500
hands, working the regular hours.”</p>

<p>The following are the words of a chamber-master,
working for the cheap shoe <span class="lock">trade:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“From people being obliged to work twice the
hours they once <i>did</i> work, or that in reason they
<i>ought</i> to work, a glut of hands is the consequence,
and the masters are led to make reductions in
the wages. They take advantage of our poverty
and lower the wages, so as to undersell each
other, and command business. My daughters
have to work fifteen hours a day that we may
make a bare living. They seem to have no
spirit and no animation in them; in fact, such
very hard work takes the youth out of them.
They have no time to enjoy their youth, and,
with all their work, they can’t present the respectable
appearance they ought.” “I” (interposed
my informant’s wife) “often feel a faintness
and oppression from my hard work, as if my
blood did not circulate.”</p>

<p>The better class of artizans denounce the system
of Sunday working as the most iniquitous of all
the impositions. They object to it, not only on
moral and religious grounds, but economically
also. “Every 600 men employed on the Sabbath,”
say they, “deprive 100 individuals of a
week’s work. Every six men who labour seven
days in the week must necessarily throw one
other man out of employ for a whole week. The
seventh man is thus deprived of his fair share of
work by the overtoiling of the other six.” This
Sunday working is a necessary consequence of
the cheap slop-trade. The workmen cannot keep
their families by their six days’ labour, and therefore
they not only, under that system, get less
wages and do more work, but by their extra
labour throw so many more hands out of employment.</p>

<p>Here then, in the over-work of many of the
trade, we find a vast cause of surplus hands, and,
consequently, of casual labour; and that the work
in these trades has not proportionately increased is
proven by the fact of the existence of a superfluity
of workmen.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the second of
the causes above cited, viz., <i>the causing of men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
work quicker</i>, and so to accomplish more in the
same time. There are several means of attaining
this end; it may be brought about either (<i>a</i>) by
making the workman’s gains depend directly on
the quantity of work executed by him, as by the
substitution of piece-work for day-work; (<i>b</i>) by
the omission of certain details or parts necessary
for the perfection of the work; (<i>c</i>) by decreasing
the workman’s pay, and so increasing the necessity
for him to execute a greater quantity of work
in order to obtain the same income; (<i>d</i>) increasing
the supervision, and encouraging a spirit
of emulation among the workpeople; (<i>e</i>) by
dividing the labour into a number of simple and
minute processes, and so increasing the expertness
of the labourers; (<i>f</i>) by the invention of
some new tool or machine for expediting the
operations of the workman.</p>

<p>I shall give a brief illustration of each of these
causes <i>seriatim</i>, showing how they tend to produce
a surplusage of hands in the trades to which they
are severally applied. And first, as to <i>making
the workman’s gains depend directly on the quantity
of work executed by him</i>.</p>

<p>Of course there are but two direct modes of paying
for labour&mdash;either by the day or by the piece.
Over-work by day-work is effected by means of
what is called the “strapping system” (as described
in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> in my letter
upon the carpenters and joiners), where a whole
shop are set to race over their work in silence
one with another, each striving to outdo the rest,
from the knowledge that anything short of extraordinary
exertion will be sure to be punished
with dismissal. Over-work by piece-work, on the
other hand, is almost a necessary consequence of
that mode of payment&mdash;for where men are paid by
the quantity they do, of course it becomes the interest
of a workman to do more than he otherwise would.</p>

<p>“Almost all who work by the day, or for a
fixed salary, that is to say, those who labour for
the gain of others, not for their own, have,” it
has been well remarked, “no interest in doing
more than the smallest quantity of work that will
pass as a fulfilment of the mere terms of their
engagement. Owing to the insufficient interest
which day labourers have in the result of their
labour, there is a natural tendency in such labour
to be extremely inefficient&mdash;a tendency only to
be overcome by vigilant superintendence on the
part of the persons who <i>are</i> interested in the
result. The ‘master’s eye’ is notoriously the
only security to be relied on. But superintend
them as you will, day labourers are so much inferior
to those who work by the piece, that, as
was before said, the latter system is practised in
all industrial occupations where the work admits
of being put out in definite portions, without involving
the necessity of too troublesome a surveillance
to guard against inferiority (or scamping)
in the execution.” But if the labourer at piece-work
is made to produce a greater quantity than
at day-work, and this solely by connecting his
own interest with that of his employer, how much
more largely must the productiveness of workmen
be increased when labouring wholly on their own
account! Accordingly it has been invariably
found that whenever the operative unites in himself
the double function of capitalist and labourer,
as the “garret-master” in the cabinet trade, and
the “chamber-master” in the shoe trade, making
up his own materials or working on his own
property, his productiveness, single-handed, is
considerably greater than can be attained even
under the large system of production, where all the
arts and appliances of which extensive capital can
avail itself are brought into operation.</p>

<p>As regards the increased production by <i>omitting
certain details necessary for the due perfection of
the work</i>, it may be said that “scamping” adds
at least 200 per cent. to the productions of the
cabinet-maker’s trade. I ascertained, in the
course of my previous inquiries, several cases
of this over-work from scamping, and adduce
two. A very quick hand, a little master, working,
as he called it, “at a slaughtering pace,” for
a warehouse, made 60 plain writing-desks in a
week of 90 hours; while a first-rate workman,
also a quick hand, made 18 in a week of 70
hours. The scamping hand said he must work
at the rate he did to make 14<i>s.</i> a week from a
slaughter-house; and so used to such style of
work had he become, that, though a few years
back he did West-end work in the best style, he
could not now make eighteen desks in a week, if
compelled to finish them in the style of excellence
displayed in the work of the journeyman employed
for the honourable trade. Perhaps, he added, he
couldn’t make them in that style at all. The
frequent use of rosewood veneers in the fancy
cabinet, and their occasional use in the general
cabinet trade gives, I was told, great facilities for
scamping. If in his haste the scamping hand
injure the veneer, or if it have been originally
faulty, he takes a mixture of gum shellac and
“colour” (colour being a composition of Venetian
red and lamp black), which he has ready by him,
rubs it over the damaged part, smooths it with a
slightly-heated iron, and so blends it with the
colour of the rosewood that the warehouseman
does not detect the flaw. In the general, as contradistinguished
from the fancy, cabinet trade I found
the same ratio of “scamping.” A good workman
in the better-paid trade made a four-foot mahogany
chest of drawers in five days, working the regular
hours, and receiving, at piece-work price, 35<i>s.</i> A
scamping hand made five of the same size in a
week, and had time to carry them for sale to the
warehouses, wait for their purchase or refusal,
and buy material. But for the necessity of doing
this the scamping hand could have made seven
in the 91 hours of his week, though of course
in a very inferior manner. “They would hold
together for a time,” I was assured, “and that
was all; but the slaughterer cared only to have
them viewly and cheap.” These two cases exceed
the average, and I have cited them to show
what <i>can</i> be done under the scamping system.</p>

<p>We now come to the <i>increased rate of working
induced by a reduction of the ordinary rate of
remuneration of the workman</i>. Not only is it
true that over-work makes under-pay, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
converse of the proposition is equally true, that
under-pay makes over-work&mdash;that is to say, it is
true of those trades where the system of piece-work
or small mastership admits of the operative
doing the utmost amount of work that he is able
to accomplish; for the workman in such cases
seldom or never thinks of reducing his expenditure
to his income, but rather of increasing his labour,
so as still to bring his income, by extra production,
up to his expenditure. Hence we find that,
as the wages of a trade descend, so do the
labourers extend their hours of work to the
utmost possible limits&mdash;they not only toil earlier
and later than before, but the Sunday becomes a
work-day like the rest (amongst the “sweaters” of
the tailoring trade Sunday labour, as I have
shown, is almost universal); and when the hours
of work are carried to the extreme of human
industry, then more is sought to be done in a
given space of time, either by the employment of
the members of their own family, or apprentices,
upon the inferior portion of the work, or else by
“scamping it.” “My employer,” I was told by
a journeyman tailor working for the Messrs.
Nicoll, “reduces my wages one-third, and the consequence
is, I put in two stitches where I used
to give three.” “I must work from six to eight,
and later,” said a pembroke-table-maker to me,
“to get 18<i>s.</i> now for my labour, where I used to
get 54<i>s.</i> a week&mdash;that’s just a third. I could in
the old times give my children good schooling
and good meals. Now children have to be put
to work very young. I have four sons working
for me at present.” Not only, therefore, does any
stimulus to extra production make over-work, and
over-work make under-pay; but under-pay, by
becoming an additional provocative to increased
industry, again gives rise in its turn to over-work.
Hence we arrive at a plain unerring law&mdash;<i>over-work
makes under-pay and under-pay makes
over-work</i>.</p>

<p>But the above means of increasing the rate of
working refer solely to those cases where the
extra labour is induced by making it the <i>interest</i>
of the workman so to do. The other means of
extra production is <i>by stricter supervision of
journeymen, or those paid by the day</i>. The
shops where this system is enforced are termed
“strapping-shops,” as indicative of establishments
where an undue quantity of work is expected
from a journeyman in the course of the day.
Such shops, though not directly making use of
cheap labour (for the wages paid in them are
generally of the higher rate), still, by exacting
more work, may of course be said, in strictness,
to encourage the system now becoming general,
of less pay and inferior skill. These strapping
establishments sometimes go by the name of
“scamping shops,” on account of the time
allowed for the manufacture of the different
articles not being sufficient to admit of good
workmanship.</p>

<p>Concerning this “<i>strapping</i>” system I received
the following extraordinary account from a man
after his heavy day’s labour. Never in all my
experience had I seen so sad an instance of overwork.
The poor fellow was so fatigued that he
could hardly rest in his seat. As he spoke he
sighed deeply and heavily, and appeared almost
spirit-broken with excessive <span class="lock">labour:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I work at what is called a strapping shop,” he
said, “and have worked at nothing else for these
many years past in London. I call ‘strapping’
doing as much work as a human being or a horse
possibly can in a day, and that without any hanging
upon the collar, but with the foreman’s eyes
constantly fixed upon you, from six o’clock in the
morning to six o’clock at night. The shop in
which I work is for all the world like a prison;
the silent system is as strictly carried out there as
in a model gaol. If a man was to ask any common
question of his neighbour, except it was
connected with his trade, he would be discharged
there and then. If a journeyman makes the least
mistake, he is packed off just the same. A man
working at such places is almost always in fear;
for the most trifling things he’s thrown out of
work in an instant. And then the quantity of
work that one is forced to get through is positively
awful; if he can’t do a plenty of it, he
don’t stop long where I am. No one would
think it was possible to get so much out of
blood and bones. No slaves work like we do.
At some of the strapping shops the foreman
keeps continually walking about with his eyes
on all the men at once. At others the foreman is
perched high up, so that he can have the whole of
the men under his eye together. I suppose since
I knew the trade that a <i>man does four times the
work that he did formerly</i>. I know a man that’s
done four pairs of sashes in a day, and one is
considered to be a good day’s labour. What’s
worse than all, the men are every one striving
one against the other. Each is trying to get
through the work quicker than his neighbours.
Four or five men are set the same job, so that they
may be all pitted against one another, and then
away they go every one striving his hardest for
fear that the others should get finished first. They
are all bearing along from the first thing in the
morning to the last at night, as hard as they can
go, and when the time comes to knock off they
are ready to drop. I was hours after I got home
last night before I could get a wink of sleep; the
soles of my feet were on fire, and my arms ached
to that degree that I could hardly lift my hand to
my head. Often, too, when we get up of a morning,
we are more tired than when we went to bed,
for we can’t sleep many a night; but we mustn’t
let our employers know it, or else they’d be certain
we couldn’t do enough for them, and we’d
get the sack. So, tired as we may be, we are
obliged to look lively, somehow or other, at the
shop of a morning. If we’re not beside our bench
the very moment the bell’s done ringing, our time’s
docked&mdash;they wont give us a single minute out
of the hour. If I was working for a fair master,
I should do nearly one-third, and sometimes a half,
less work than I am now forced to get through,
and, even to manage that much, I shouldn’t be
idle a second of my time. It’s quite a mystery
to me how they <i>do</i> contrive to get so much work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
out of the men. But they are very clever people.
They know how to have the most out of a man,
better than any one in the world. They are all
picked men in the shop&mdash;regular ‘strappers,’ and
no mistake. The most of them are five foot ten,
and fine broad-shouldered, strong-backed fellows
too&mdash;if they weren’t they wouldn’t have them.
Bless you, they make no words with the men,
they sack them if they’re not strong enough to do
all they want; and they can pretty soon tell, the
very first shaving a man strikes in the shop, what
a chap is made of. Some men are done up at such
work&mdash;quite old men and gray with spectacles on,
by the time they are forty. I have seen fine
strong men, of 36, come in there and be bent
double in two or three years. They are most all
countrymen at the strapping shops. If they see
a great strapping fellow, who they think has got
some stuff about him that will come out, they will
give him a job directly. We are used for all the
world like cab or omnibus horses. Directly they’ve
had all the work out of us, we are turned off, and
I am sure, after my day’s work is over, my feelings
must be very much the same as one of the
London cab horses. As for Sunday, it is <i>literally</i>
a day of rest with us, for the greater part of us
lay a-bed all day, and even that will hardly take
the aches and pains out of our bones and muscles.
When I’m done and flung by, of course I must
starve.”</p>

<p>The next means of inducing a quicker rate of
working, and so economizing the number of labourers,
is by the <i>division</i> and <i>subdivision of
labour</i>. In perhaps all the skilled work of
London, of the better sort, this is more or less
the case; it is the case in a much smaller degree
in the country.</p>

<p>The nice subdivision makes the operatives perfect
adepts in their respective branches, working
at them with a greater and a more assured facility
than if their care had to be given to the whole
work, and in this manner the work is completed
in less time, and consequently by fewer hands.</p>

<p>In illustration of the extraordinary increased
productiveness induced by the division of labour,
I need only cite the well-known <span class="lock">cases:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It is found,” says Mr. Mill, “that the productive
power of labour is increased by carrying the
separation further and further; by breaking down
more and more every process of industry into
parts, so that each labourer shall confine himself
to an even smaller number of simple operations.
And thus, in time, arise those remarkable cases
of what is called the division of labour, with
which all readers on subjects of this nature are
familiar. Adam Smith’s illustration from pin-making,
though so well-known, is so much to the
point, that I will venture once more to transcribe
it. ‘The business of making a pin is divided into
eighteen distinct operations. One man draws out
the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a
fourth points it, and a fifth grinds it at the top for
receiving the head; to make the head requires
two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a
peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another;
it is even a trade by itself to put them into the
paper. I have seen a small manufactory where
ten men only were employed, and where some of
them, consequently, performed two or three distinct
operations. But though they were very poor,
and therefore but indifferently accommodated with
the necessary machinery, they could, when they
exerted themselves, make among them about
twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in
a pound upwards of 4000 pins of a middling
size.</p>

<p>“‘Those ten persons, therefore, could make
among them upwards of 48,000 pins in a day.
Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of
48,000 pins, might be considered as making 4800
pins in a day. But if they had all wrought
separately and independently, and without any of
them having been educated to this peculiar business,
they certainly could not each of them have
made 20, perhaps not one pin in a day.’”</p>

<p>M. Say furnishes a still stronger example of the
effects of division of labour, from a not very important
branch of industry certainly, the manufacture
of playing cards. “It is said by those engaged
in the business, that each card, that is, a piece
of pasteboard of the size of the hand, before being
ready for sale, does not undergo fewer than 70
operations, every one of which might be the occupation
of a distinct class of workmen. And
if there are not 70 classes of work-people in each
card manufactory, it is because the division of
labour is not carried so far as it might be; because
the same workman is charged with two, three, or
four distinct operations. The influence of this
distribution of employment is immense. I have
seen a card manufactory where thirty workmen
produced daily 15,500 cards, being above 500
cards for each labourer; and it may be presumed
that if each of these workmen were obliged to
perform all the operations himself, even supposing
him a practised hand, he would not, perhaps, complete
two cards in a day; and the 30 workmen,
instead of 15,500 cards, would make only 60.”</p>

<p>One great promoter of the decrease of manual
labour is to be found in the economy of labour
from a very different cause to any I have pointed
out as tending to the increase of surplus hands
and casual labour, viz., to <i>the use of machinery</i>.</p>

<p>In this country the use of machinery has
economised the labour both of man and horse to
a greater extent than is known in any other
land, and that in nearly all departments of commerce
or traffic. The total estimated machine
power in the kingdom is 600,000,000 of human
beings, and this has been all produced within the
last century. In agriculture, for example, the
threshing of the corn was the peasant’s work of
the later autumn and of a great part of the winter,
until towards the latter part of the last century.
The harvest was hardly considered complete until
the corn was threshed by the peasants. On the
first introduction of the threshing machines, they
were demolished in many places by the country
labourers, whose rage was excited to find that
their winter’s work, instead of being regular, had
become <i>casual</i>.</p>

<p>But the use of these machines is now almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
universal. It would, of course, be the height of
absurdity to say that threshing machines could
possibly increase the number of threshers, even as
the reaping machines cannot possibly increase
the number of reapers; their effect is rather to
displace the greater number of labourers so engaged,
and hence indeed the “economy” of them.
It is not known what number of men were, at
any time, employed in threshing corn. Their
displacement was gradual, and in some of the
more remote parts of the provinces, the flails of
the threshers may be heard still, but if a threshing
machine&mdash;for they are of different power&mdash;do the
work, as has been stated, of six labourers, the
economization or displacement of manual labour is
at once shown to be the economization and displacement
of the whole labour (for a season) of a
country side; thus increasing surplus hands.</p>

<p>In other matters&mdash;in the unloading vessels by
cranes, in <i>all</i> branches of manufactures, and even
in such minor matters as the grinding of coffee
berries, and the cutting and splitting of wood for
lucifer matches, an immense amount of manual
labour has been minimized, economized, or displaced
by steam machinery. On my inquiry into
the condition of the London sawyers, I found that
the labour of 2000 men had been displaced by
the steam saw-mills of the metropolis alone. At
one of the largest builder’s I saw machines for
making mortises and tenons, for sticking mouldings,
and, indeed, performing all the operations
of the carpenter&mdash;one such machine doing the
work, perhaps, of a hundred men. I asked the
probable influence that such an instrument was
likely to have on the men? “Ruin them all,” was
the laconic reply of the superintendent of the
business! Within the last year casks have been
made by machinery&mdash;a feat that the coopers
declared impossible. Wheels, also, have been
lately produced by steam. I need, however,
as I have so recently touched upon the subject,
do no more than call attention to the information
I have given (p. <a href="#Page_240">240</a>, vol. ii.) concerning
the use of machinery in lieu of human
labour. It is there shown that if the public street-sweeping
were effected, throughout the metropolis,
by the machines, nearly 196 of the 275 manual
labourers, now scavaging for the parish contractors,
would be thrown out of work, and deprived of
7438<i>l.</i>, out of their joint earnings, in the year.</p>

<p>It is the fashion of political economists to
insist on the general proposition that machinery
increases the demand for labour, rather than decreases
it; when they write unguardedly, however,
they invariably betray a consciousness that
the benefits of machinery to manual labourers are
not quite so invariable as they would otherwise
make out. Here, for instance, is a confession from
the pamphlet on “the Employer and Employed,”
published by the Messrs. Chambers, gentlemen
who surely cannot be accused of being averse to
economical doctrines. It is true the pamphlet is
intended to show the evils of strikes to working
men, but it likewise points out the evils of mechanical
power to the same class when applied to
certain operations.</p>

<p>“Strikes also lead to <i>the superseding of hand
labour by machines</i>,” says this little work. “In
1831, on the occasion of a strike at Manchester,
several of the capitalists, afraid of their business
being driven to other countries, had recourse to
the celebrated machinists, Messrs. Sharp and
Co. of Manchester, requesting them to direct
the inventive talents of their partner, Mr. Roberts,
to the construction of a self-acting mule, in
order to emancipate the trade from galling slavery
and impending ruin. Under assurances of the
most liberal encouragement in the adoption of
his invention, Mr. Roberts suspended his professional
pursuits as an engineer, and set his fertile
genius to construct a spinning automaton. In the
course of a few months he produced a machine,
called the ‘Self-acting Mule,’ which, in 1834, was
in operation in upwards of 60 factories; <i>doing
the work of the head spinners so much better than
they could do it themselves, as to leave them no
chance against it</i>.</p>

<p>“In his work on the ‘Philosophy of Manufactures,’
Dr. Ure observes on the same subject&mdash;‘The
elegant art of calico-printing, which embodies
in its operations the most elegant problems of
chemistry, as well as mechanics, had been for a
long period the sport of foolish journeymen, who
turned the liberal means of comfort it furnished
them into weapons of warfare against their employers
and the trade itself. They were, in fact,
by their delirious combinations, plotting to kill the
goose which laid the golden eggs of their industry,
or to force it to fly off to a foreign land, where it
might live without molestation. In the spirit of
Egyptian task-masters, the operative printers dictated
to the manufacturers the number and quality
of the apprentices to be admitted into the trade,
the hours of their own labour, and the wages to
be paid them. At length capitalists sought deliverance
from this intolerable bondage in the resources
of science, and were speedily reinstated in their
legitimate dominion of the head over the inferior
members. The four-colour and five-colour machines,
which now render calico-printing an unerring and
expeditious process, are mounted in all great
establishments. It was under the high-pressure
of the same despotic confederacies, that self-acting
apparatus for executing the dyeing and rinsing
operations has been devised.’</p>

<p>“The croppers of the West Riding of Yorkshire,
and the hecklers or flax-dressers, can unfold ‘a
tale of wo’ on this subject. Their earnings
exceeded those of most mechanics; but the frequency
of strikes among them, and the irregularities
in their hours and times of working,
compelled masters to substitute machinery for
their manual labour. <i>Their trades, in consequence,
have been in a great measure superseded.</i>”</p>

<p>It must, then, be admitted that machinery, <i>in
some cases at least</i>, does displace manual labour,
and so tend to produce a surplusage of labourers,
even as over-work, Sunday-work, scamping-work,
strapping-work, piece-work, minutely-divided work,
&amp;c., have the same effect so long as the quantity
of work to be done remains unaltered. <i>The extensibility
of the market</i> is the one circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
which determines whether the economy of labour
produced by these means is a blessing or a curse
to the nation. To apply mechanical power, the
division of labour, the large system of production,
or indeed any other means of enabling a less
number of labourers to do the same amount of
work <i>when the quantity of work to be done is
limited in its nature</i>, as, for instance, the threshing
of corn, the sawing of wood, &amp;c., is necessarily
to make either paupers or criminals of those who
were previously honest independent men, living by
the exercise of their industry in that particular
direction. Economize your labour one-half, in
connection with a particular article, and you must
sell twice the quantity of that article or displace
a certain number of the labourers; that is to say,
suppose it requires 400 men to produce 4000 commodities
in a given time, then, if you enable 200
men to produce the same quantity in the same time,
you must get rid of 8000 commodities, or deprive
a certain number of labourers of their ordinary
means of living. Indeed, the proposition is almost
self-evident, though generally ignored by social
philosophers: economize your labour at a greater
rate than you expand your markets, and you must
necessarily increase your paupers and criminals in
precisely the same ratio. “The division of labour,”
says Mr. Mill, following Adam Smith, “is limited
by the extent of the market. If by the separation
of pin-making into ten distinct employments
48,000 pins can be made in a day, this separation
will only be advisable if the number of accessible
consumers is such as to require every day something
like 48,000 pins. If there is a demand for
only 25,000, the division of labour can be advantageously
carried but to the extent which will
every day produce that smaller number.” Again,
as regards the large system of production, the
same authority says, “the possibility of substituting
the large system of production for the small
depends, of course, on the extent of the market.
The large system can only be advantageous when
a large amount of business is to be done; it
implies, therefore, either a populous and flourishing
community, or a great opening for exportation.”
But these are mere glimmerings of the broad incontrovertible
principle, that <i>the economization of
labour at a greater rate than the expansion of the
markets, is necessarily the cause of surplus labour
in a community</i>.</p>

<p>The effect of machinery in depriving the families
of agricultural labourers of their ordinary sources
of income is well established. “Those countries,”
writes Mr. Thornton, “in which the class of agricultural
labourers is most depressed, have all one
thing in common. Each of them was formerly
the seat of a flourishing manufacture carried
on by the cottagers at their own homes, which
has now decayed or been withdrawn to other
situations. Thus, in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire,
the wives and children of labouring
men had formerly very profitable occupation in
making lace; during the last war a tolerable lacemaker,
working eight hours a day, could easily
earn 10<i>s.</i> or 12<i>s.</i> a week; the profits of this employment
have been since so much reduced by the
use of machinery, that a pillow lacemaker must
now work twelve hours daily to earn 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last of the conditions above cited, as causing
the same or a greater amount of work to be executed
with a less quantity of labour, is <i>the large
system of production</i>. Mr. Babbage and Mr. Mill
have so well and fully pointed out “the economy
of labour” effected in this manner, that I cannot
do better than quote from them upon this
<span class="lock">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Even when no additional subdivision of the
work,” says Mr. Mill, “would follow an enlargement
of the operations, there will be good economy
in enlarging them to the point at which every
person to whom it is convenient to assign a
special occupation will have full employment in
that occupation.” This point is well illustrated
by Mr. Babbage:&mdash;“If machines be kept working
through the 24 hours” [which is evidently the
only economical mode of employing them], “it is
necessary that some person shall attend to admit
the workmen at the time they relieve each other;
and whether the porter or other servant so employed
admit one person or twenty, his rest will
be equally disturbed. It will also be necessary
occasionally to adjust or repair the machine; and
this can be done much better by a workman
accustomed to machine-making than by the person
who uses it. Now, since the good performance
and the duration of machines depend, to a very
great extent, upon correcting every shake or
imperfection in their parts as soon as they appear,
the prompt attention of a workman resident on
the spot will considerably reduce the expenditure
arising from the wear and tear of the machinery.
But in the case of a single lace-frame, or a single
loom, this would be too expensive a plan. Here,
then, arises another circumstance, which tends to
enlarge the extent of the factory. It ought to
consist of such a number of machines as shall
occupy the whole time of one workman in keeping
them in order. If extended beyond that number
the same principle of economy would point out
the necessity of doubling or tripling the number
of machines, in order to employ the whole time
of two or three skilful workmen. Where one
portion of the workman’s labour consists in the
exertion of mere physical force, as in weaving,
and in many similar arts, it will soon occur to the
manufacturer that, if that part were executed by a
steam-engine, the same man might, in the case of
weaving, attend to two or more looms at once;
and, since we already suppose that one or more
operative engineers have been employed, the
number of looms may be so arranged that their
time shall be fully occupied in keeping the steam-engine
and the looms in order.</p>

<p>“Pursuing the same principles, the manufactory
becomes gradually so enlarged that the expense of
lighting during the night amounts to a considerable
sum; and as there are already attached to
the establishment persons who are up all night,
and can therefore constantly attend to it, and
also engineers to make and keep in repair any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
machinery, the addition of an apparatus for making
gas to light the factory leads to a new extension,
at the same time that it contributes, by
diminishing the expense of lighting and the risk
of accidents from fire, to reduce the cost of manufacturing.</p>

<p>“Long before a factory has reached this extent
it will have been found necessary to establish an
accountant’s department, with clerks to pay the
workmen, and to see that they arrive at their
stated times; and this department must be in
communication with the agents who purchase the
raw produce, and with those who sell the manufactured
article. It will cost these clerks and
accountants little more time and trouble to pay a
large number of workmen than a small number,
to check the accounts of large transactions than
of small. If the business doubled itself it would
probably be necessary to increase, but certainly
not to double, the number either of accountants
or of buying and selling agents. <i>Every increase
of business would enable the whole to be carried on
with a proportionally smaller amount of labour.</i>
As a general rule, the expenses of a business do
not increase by any means proportionally to the
quantity of business. Let us take as an example
a set of operations which we are accustomed to
see carried on by one great establishment&mdash;that of
the Post Office.</p>

<p>“Suppose that the business, let us say only of
the London letter-post, instead of being centralised
in a single concern, were divided among five or
six competing companies. Each of these would
be obliged to maintain almost as large an establishment
as is now sufficient for the whole.
Since each must arrange for receiving and delivering
letters in all parts of the town, each must
send letter-carriers into every street, and almost
every alley, and this, too, as many times in the
day as is now done by the Post Office, if the
service is to be as well performed. Each must
have an office for receiving letters in every neighbourhood,
with all subsidiary arrangements for
collecting the letters from the different offices and
re-distributing them. I say nothing of the much
greater number of superior officers who would be
required to check and control the subordinates,
implying not only a greater cost in salaries for
such responsible officers, but the necessity, perhaps,
of being satisfied in many instances with an
inferior standard of qualification, and so failing in
the object.”</p>

<p>But this refers solely to the “large system of
business” as applied to purposes of manufacture
and distribution. In connection with agriculture
there is the same saving of labour effected.
“The large farmer,” says Mr. Mill, “has some
advantage in the article of buildings. It does
not cost so much to house a great number of
cattle in one building, as to lodge them equally
well in several buildings. There is also some
advantage in implements. A small farmer is
not so likely to possess expensive instruments.
But the principal agricultural implements, even
when of the best construction, are not expensive.
It may not answer to a small farmer
to own a threshing machine for the small
quantity of corn he has to thresh; but there is
no reason why such a machine should not in
every neighbourhood be owned in common, or
provided by some person to whom the others pay
a consideration for its use. The large farmer can
make some saving in cost of carriage. There is
nearly as much trouble in carrying a small portion
of produce to market, as a much greater produce;
in bringing home a small, as a much larger quantity
of manure, and articles of daily consumption.
There is also the greater cheapness of buying
things in large quantities.”</p>

<p>A short time ago I went into Buckinghamshire
to look into the allotment system. And, in one
parish of 1800 acres, I found that some years
ago there were seventeen farmers who occupied,
upon the average, 100 acres each, and who, previous
to the immigration of the Irish harvest-men, <i>constantly</i>
employed six men a-piece, or, in the aggregate,
upwards of 100 hands. Now, however, the
farmers in the same parish occupy to the extent of
300 acres each, and respectively employ only six
men <i>and a few extra hands at harvest time</i>.
Thus the number of hands employed by this
system has been decreased one-half. I learned,
moreover, from a clergyman there, who had
resided in Wiltshire, that the same thing was
going on in that county also; that small farms
were giving way to large farms, and that at least
half the labourers had been displaced. The
agricultural labourers, at the time of taking the
last census, were 1,500,000 in number; so that,
if this system be generally carried out, there must
be 750,000 labourers and their families, or
3,000,000 people, deprived of their living by it.</p>

<p>Sir James Graham, in his evidence before the
Committee on Criminal Commitments, has given us
some curious particulars as to the decrease of the
number of hands required for agricultural purposes,
where the large system of production is pursued
in place of the small: he has told us how many
hands he was enabled to get rid of by these
means, the proportion of labour displaced, it will
be seen, amounted to about 10 per cent. of the
labouring population. In answer to a question
relative to the increase of population in his district,
he <span class="lock">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have myself taken <i>very strong means to
prevent it</i>, for it so happens that my whole estate
came out of lease in the year 1822, after the
currency of a lease of fourteen years; and by
<i>consolidation of farms, and the destruction of
cottages, I have diminished, upon my own property,
the population to the extent of from 300 to
400 souls</i>.”</p>

<p>“On how many acres?&mdash;On about 30,000
acres.” [This is at the rate of one in every 100
acres].</p>

<p>“What was the whole extent of population?&mdash;It
was under 4000 before I reduced it.</p>

<p>“What became of those 300 or 400?&mdash;The
greater part of them, being small tenants, were
enabled to find farms on the estates of other proprietors,
who pursued the opposite course of subdividing
their estates for the purpose of obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
higher nominal rents; <i>others have become day
labourers</i>, and as day labourers, I have reason to
know, they are more thriving than they were on
my estate as small farmers, subject to a high rent,
which their want of capital seldom enabled them
to pay; two or three of these families went to
America.</p>

<p>“Have you any out of work?&mdash;None entirely
out of work, some only partially employed; but
since the <i>dispersion of this large mass of population</i>,
the supply of labour has not much exceeded
the demand, for <i>whenever I removed a family, I
pulled down the house</i>, and the parochial jealousy
respecting settlements is an ample check on the
influx of strangers.”</p>

<p>Similar to the influence of the large system of
production in its displacement of labourers, as
enabling a larger quantity of work to be executed
by one establishment with a smaller number of
hands than would be required were the amount of
work to be divided into a number of smaller establishments,&mdash;similar
to this mode of economizing
labour, is that mode of work which, by altering
the produce rather than the mode of production,
and by substituting an article that requires less
labour for one that required more, gets rid of a
large quantity of labour, and, consequently, adds to
the surplusage of labourers. An instance of this
is in the substitution of pasturage for tillage.
“<i>Plough less and graze more</i>,” says Sir J. Graham,
the great economist of labour, simply because
fewer people will be required to attend to the
land. But this plan of grazing instead of ploughing
was adopted in this country some centuries
back, and with what effect to the labourers and the
people at large, the following extract from the
work of Mr. Thornton, on over-population, will
<span class="lock">show:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The extension of the woollen manufacture
was raising the price of wool; and the little
attendance which sheep require was an additional
motive for causing sheep farming to be preferred
to tillage. Arable land, therefore, began to be
converted into pasture; and the seemingly-interminable
corn fields, which, like those of Germany
at this day, probably extended for miles without
having their even surface broken by fences or
any other visible boundaries, disappeared. After
being sown with grass they were surrounded and
divided by inclosures, to prevent the sheep from
straying, and to do away with the necessity of
having shepherds always on the watch. By these
changes the quantity of work to be done upon a
farm was exceedingly diminished, and most of the
servants, whom it had been usual to board and
lodge in the manor and farm-houses, were dismissed.
This was not all. The married farm-servants
were ousted from their cottages, which
were pulled down, and their gardens and fields
were annexed to the adjoining meadows. The
small farmers were treated in the same way, as
their leases fell in, <i>and were sent to join the daily
increasing crowd of competitors for work that was
daily increasing in quantity</i>.</p>

<p>“Even freeholders were in some instances ejected
from their lands. This social revolution had probably
commenced even before the prosperity of
the peasantry had reached its climax; but in
1487 it attracted the notice of Parliament, and
an Act was passed to restrain its progress; for
already it was observed that inclosures were becoming
‘more frequent, whereby arable land,
<i>which could not be manured without people and
families, was turned into pasture, which was
easily rid by a few herdsmen</i>;’ and that
‘tenancies for years, lives, and at will, whereupon
most of the yeomanry lived, were turned into
demesnes’<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. In 1533<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, an Act was passed
strongly condemning the practice of ‘accumulating’
farms, which it was declared had reduced
‘a marvellous multitude’ of the people to poverty
and misery, and left them no alternative but to
steal, or to die ‘pitifully’ of cold and hunger.
In this Act it was stated that single farms might
be found with flocks of from 10,000 to 20,000
sheep upon them; and it was ordained that no
man should keep more than 2000 sheep, except
upon his own land, or rent more than two
farms.</p>

<p>“Two years later it was enacted that the king
should have a moiety of the profits of land converted
(subsequently to a date specified) from
tillage to pastures, until a suitable house was
erected, and the land was restored to tillage. In
1552, a law<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> was made which required that on
all estates as large a quantity of land as had
been kept in tillage for four years together at any
time since the accession of Henry VIII., should
be so continued in tillage. But these, and many
subsequent enactments of the same kind, had not
the smallest effect in checking the consolidation of
farms. We find Roger Ascham, in Queen Elizabeth’s
reign, lamenting the dispersion of families,
the ruin of houses, the breaking up and destruction
of ‘the noble yeomanry, the honour and
strength of England.’ Harrison also speaks of
towns pulled down for sheep-walks; ‘and of the
tenements that had fallen either down or into the
lord’s hands;’ or had been ‘brought and united
together by other men, so that in some one
manor, seventeen, eighteen, or twenty houses
were shrunk.’<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>“‘Where have been a great many householders
and inhabitants,’ says Bishop Latimer, ‘there is
now but a shepherd and his dog.’<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And in a
curious tract, published in 1581, by one William
Stafford, a husbandman is made to exclaim,
‘Marry, these inclosures do and undo us all, for
they make us pay dearer for our land that we
occupy, and causeth that we can have no land to
put to tillage; all is taken up for pasture, either
for sheep or for grazing of cattle, insomuch that I
have known of late a dozen ploughs, within less
compass than six miles about me, laid down
within this seven years; and where threescore
persons or upwards had their livings, now one
man, with his cattle, hath all. Those sheep is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the cause of all our mischief, for they have driven
husbandry out of the country, by which was
increased before all kinds of victuals, and now
altogether sheep, sheep, sheep.’<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> While numbers
of persons were thus continually driven from
their homes, and deprived of their means of livelihood,
we need not be at a loss to account for the
increase of vagrancy, without ascribing it to the
increase of population.”</p>

<p>As an instance, within our time, of the same
mode of causing a surplusage of labourers, and so
adding to the quantity of casual labour in the
kingdom, viz., by the extension of pasturage and
consequent diminution of tillage, we may cite the
“clearances,” as they were called, which took place,
some few years back, in the Highlands of Scotland.
“It is only within the last few years,” says
the author above quoted, “that the strathes and
glens of Sutherland have been <i>cleared of their
inhabitants, and that the whole country has been
converted into one immense sheepwalk</i>, over which
the traveller may proceed for 40 miles together
without seeing a tree or a stone wall, or anything,
but a heath dotted with sheep and lambs<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>....
The example of Sutherland is imitated in the
neighbouring counties. During the last four
years <i>some hundreds of families</i> have been
‘weeded’ out of Ross-shire, and nearly 400
more have received notice to quit next year.
Similar notice has been given to 34 families in
Cromarty, and only the other day eighteen families,
who were living in peace and comfort, in Glencalvie,
in Ross-shire, were expelled from the farms
occupied for ages by themselves and their forefathers,
to make room for sheep.” And still we
are told to “<i>plough less and graze more!</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to the last-mentioned of the circumstances
inducing a surplusage of labourers,
and, consequently, augmenting the amount of
casual labour throughout the kingdom, viz., by
<i>altering the mode of hiring the labourers</i>. At
page <a href="#Page_236">236</a> of the present volume, I have said, in
connection with this part of the subject,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Formerly the mode of hiring farm-labourers
was by the year, so that the employer was bound
to maintain the men when unemployed. But now
weekly hirelings and even journey-work, or hiring
by the day, prevail, and the labourers being paid
mere subsistence-money only when wanted are
necessitated to become either paupers or thieves
when their services are no longer required. It is,
moreover, this change from yearly to weekly and
daily hirings, and the consequent discarding of
men when no longer wanted, that has partly
caused the immense mass of surplus labourers, who
are continually vagabondizing through the country,
begging or stealing as they go&mdash;men for whom
there is but some two or three weeks’ work (harvesting,
hop-picking, and the like) throughout the
year.”</p>

<p>Blackstone, in treating of the laws relating
to master and servant (the greater part of the
farm labourers or farm servants, as they were then
called, being included under the latter head), tells
us at page 425 of his first <span class="lock">volume&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The first sort of servants, acknowledged by the
laws of England, are <span class="smcap lowercase">MENIAL SERVANTS</span>; so called
from being <i>inter mœnia</i> or domestic. The contract
between them and their masters arises upon the
hiring. If the hiring be generally, without any
particular <i>time limited</i>, the law construes it to be
a <i>hiring for a year</i> (Co. Lit. 42); upon a principle
of natural equity, that the servant shall serve, and
the master maintain him, throughout all the revolutions
of the respective seasons, as well when
<i>there is work to be</i> done, as <i>when there is not</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton says, “until recently it had been
common for farm servants, even when married
and living in their own cottages, to take their
meals with their master; and, what was of more
consequence, in every farm-house, many unmarried
servants, of both sexes, were lodged, as well as
boarded. The latter, therefore, even if ill paid,
might be tolerably housed and fed, and many of
them fared, no doubt, much better than they could
have done if they had been left to provide for
themselves, with treble their actual wages.”</p>

<p>Formerly throughout the kingdom&mdash;and it is a
custom <i>still</i> prevalent in some parts, more especially
in the north&mdash;single men and women seeking
engagements as farm-servants, congregated at
what were called the “Hirings,” held usually on
the three successive market days, which were
nearest to May-day and Martinmas-day. The
hiring was thus at two periods of the year, but
the engagement was usually for the twelvemonth.
By the concurrent consent, however, of master
and servant, when the hiring took place, either
side might terminate it at the expiration of the six
months, by giving due notice; or a further hiring
for a second twelvemonth could be legally effected
without the necessity of again going to the hirings.
The servants, even before their term of service
had expired, could attend a hiring (generally held
under the authority of the town’s charter) as a
matter of right; the master and mistress having
no authority to prevent them. The Market Cross
was the central point for the holding of the hirings,
and the men and women, the latter usually the
most numerous, stood in rows around the cross.
The terms being settled, the master or mistress
gave the servant “a piece of money,” known as a
“god’s penny” (the “handsel penny”), the offer
and acceptance of this god’s penny being a legal
ratification of the agreement, without any other
step. In the old times such engagements had
almost always (as shown in the term “God’s
penny”) a character of religious obligation. At
the earliest period, the hirings were held in the
church-yards; afterwards by the Market Cross.</p>

<p>I have spoken of this matter more in the
past than the present tense, for the system is
greatly changed as regards the male farm-servant,
though little as regards the female. Now
the male farm-labourers, instead of being hired for
a specific term, are more generally hired by week,
by job, or by day; indeed, even “half-a-day’s”
work is known. At one period it was merely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
married country labourers, residing in their own
cottages, who were temporarily engaged, but it is
now the general body, married and unmarried, old
and young, with a few exceptions. Formerly the
farmer was bound to find work for six or twelve
months (for both terms existed) for his hired
labourers. If the land did not supply it, still the
man must be maintained, and be paid his full wages
when due. By such a provision, the labour and
wage of the hired husbandman were regular and
rarely <i>casual</i>; but this arrangement is now seldom
entered into, and the hired husbandman’s labour
is consequently generally casual and rarely regular.
This principle of hiring labourers only for so long
as they are wanted, as contradistinguished from
the “<i>principle of natural equity</i>,” spoken of by
Blackstone, which requires that “the servant shall
serve and the master maintain him <i>throughout all
the revolutions of the respective seasons, as well
when there is work to be done as when there is not</i>,”
has been the cause, perhaps, of more casual labour
and more pauperism and crime, in this country,
than, perhaps, any other of the antecedents before
mentioned. The harvest is now collected solely
by casual labourers, by a horde of squalid immigrants,
or the tribe of natural and forced vagabonds
who are continually begging or stealing their way
throughout the country; our hops are picked, our
fruit and vegetables gathered by the same precarious
bands&mdash;wretches who, perhaps, obtain
some three months’ harvest labour in the course of
the year. The ships at our several ports are discharged
by the same “<i>casual hands</i>,” who may be
seen at our docks scrambling like hounds for the
occasional bit of bread that is vouchsafed to them;
there numbers loiter throughout the day, even on
the chance of <i>an hour’s employment</i>; for the term
of hiring has been cut down to the finest possible
limits, so that the labourer may not be paid for
even a second longer than he is wanted. And
since he gets only bare subsistence money when
employed, “What,” we should ask ourselves,
“<i>must</i> be his lot when unemployed?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now come to consider the circumstances causing
an undue increase of the labourers in a country.
Thus far we have proceeded on the assumption
that both the quantity of work to be done and the
number of hands to do it remained stationary, and
we have seen that by the mere alteration of the
time, rate, and mode of working, a vast amount of
surplus, and, consequently, casual labour may be
induced in a community. We have now to ascertain
how, still assuming the quantity of work to
remain unaltered, the same effect may be brought
about by an undue <i>increase of the number of
labourers</i>.</p>

<p>There are many means by which the number
of labourers may be increased besides that of a
positive increase of the people. These <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1. By the undue increase of apprentices.</li>

<li>2. By drafting into the ranks of labour those
who should be otherwise engaged, as women and
children.</li>

<li>3. By the importation of labourers from abroad.</li>

<li>4. By the migration of country labourers to
towns, and so overcrowding the market in the
cities.</li>

<li>5. By the depression of other trades.</li>

<li>6. By the undue increase of the people themselves.</li></ul>


<p>Each and every of the first-mentioned causes
are as effective a circumstance for the promotion
of surplus labour, as even the positive extension
of the population of the country.</p>

<p>Let me begin with the undue increase of a
trade by means of <i>apprentices</i>.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, one of the chief aids to the
cheap system. For it is principally by apprentice
labour that the better masters, as well as workmen,
are undersold, and the skilled labourer consequently
depressed to the level of the unskilled.
But the great evil is, that the cheapening of goods
by this means causes an undue increase in the
trade. The apprentices grow up and become labourers,
and so the trade is glutted with workmen,
and casual labour is the consequence.</p>

<p>This apprentice system is the great bane of the
printer’s trade. Country printers take an undue
number of boys to help them cheap; these lads
grow up, and then, finding wages in the provinces
depressed through this system of apprentice
labour, they flock to the towns, and so tend to
glut the labour market, and consequently to increase
the number of casual hands.</p>

<p>One cause of the increased surplus and casual
labour in such trades as dressing-case, work-box,
writing-desk-making and other things in the fancy
cabinet trade (among the worst trades even in
Spitalfields and Bethnal Green), shoemaking, and
especially of women and children’s shoes, is the
taking of many apprentices by small masters (supplying
the great warehouses). As journey-work is
all but unknown in the slop fancy cabinet trade, an
apprentice, when he has “served his time,” must
start on his own account in the same wretched
way of business, or become a casual labourer in
some unskilled avocation, and this is one way in
which the hands surely, although gradually, increase
beyond the demand. It is the same with
the general slop cabinet-maker’s trade in the same
parts. The small masters supply the “slaughterhouses,”
the linen-drapers, &amp;c., who sell cheap
furniture; they work in the quickest and most
scamping manner, and do more work (which is
nearly all done on the chance of sale), as they must
confine themselves to one branch. The slop chair-makers
cannot make tables, nor the slop table-makers,
chairs; nor the cheffonier and drawer-makers,
bedsteads; for they have not been taught. Even
if they knew the method, and <i>could</i> accomplish
other work, the want of practice would compel
them to do it slowly, and the slop mechanic can
never afford to work slowly. Such classes of little
masters, then, to meet the demand for low-priced
furniture, rear their sons to the business, and frequently
take apprentices, to whom they pay small
amounts. The hands so trained (as in the former
instances) are not skilled enough to work for the
honourable trade, so that they can only adopt the
course pursued by their parents, or masters, before
them. Hence a rapid, although again gradual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
increase of surplus hands; or hence a resort to
some unskilled labour, to be wrought casually.
This happens too, but in a smaller degree, in trades
which are not slop, from the same cause. Concerning
the <i>apprentice system</i> in the boot and shoe
trade, when making my inquiries into the condition
of the London workmen, I received the
following <span class="lock">statements:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My employer had seven apprentices when I
was with him; of these, two were parish apprentices
(I was one), and the other five from the
Refuge for the Destitute, at Hoxton. With each
Refuge boy he got 5<i>l.</i> and three suits of clothes,
and a kit (tools). With the parish boys of Covent-garden
and St. Andrew’s, Holborn, he got 5<i>l.</i>
and two suits of clothes, reckoning what the boy
wore as one. My employer was a journeyman,
and by having all us boys he was able to get up
work very cheap, though he received good wages
for it. We boys had no allowance in money, only
board, lodging, and clothing. The board was
middling, the lodging was too, and there was
nothing to complain about in the clothing. He
was severe in the way of flogging. I ran away
six times myself, but was forced to go back again,
as I had no money and no friend in the world.
When I first ran away I complained to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
the magistrate, and he was going to give me six
weeks. He said it would do me good; but Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; interfered, and I was let go. I don’t
know what he was going to give me six weeks for,
unless it was for having a black eye that my
master had given me with the stirrup. Of the
seven only one served his time out. He let me
off two years before my time was up, as we
couldn’t agree. The mischief of taking so many
apprentices is this:&mdash;The master gets money with
them from the parish, and can feed them much as
he likes as to quality and quantity; and if they
run away soon, the master’s none the worse, for
he’s got the money; and so boys are sent out to
turn vagrants when they run away, as such boys
have no friends. Of us seven boys (at the wages
our employer got) one could earn 19<i>s.</i>, another
15<i>s.</i>, another 12<i>s.</i>, another 10<i>s.</i>, and the rest not
less than 8<i>s.</i> each, for all worked sixteen hours
a day&mdash;that’s 4<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> a week for the seven, or
225<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a year. You must recollect I reckon
this on nearly the best wages in the women’s
trade. My employer you may call a sweater, and
he made money fast, though he drank a good deal.
We seldom saw him when he was drunk; but he
<i>did</i> pitch into us when he was getting sober.
Look how easily such a man with apprentices can
undersell others when he wants to work as cheap
as possible for the great slop warehouses. They
serve haberdashers so cheap that oft enough it’s
starvation wages for the same shops.”</p>

<p>Akin to the system of using a large number of
apprentices is that of <i>employing boys and girls</i>
to displace the work of men, at the less laborious
parts of the trade.</p>

<p>“It is probable,” said a working shoemaker to
me, “that, independent of apprentices, 200 additional
hands are added to our already over-burdened
trade yearly. Sewing boys soon learn
the use of the knife. Plenty of poor men will
offer to finish them for a pound and a month’s
work; and men, for a few shillings and a few
weeks’ work, will teach other boys to sew. There
are many of the wives of chamber-masters teach
girls entirely to make children’s work for a pound
and a few months’ work, and there are many in
Bethnal-green who have learnt the business in this
way. These teach some other members of their
families, and then actually set up in business in
opposition to those who taught them, and in
cutting offer their work for sale at a much lower
rate of profit; and shopkeepers in town and
country, having circulars sent to solicit custom,
will have their goods from a warehouse that will
serve them cheapest; then the warehouseman will
have them cheap from the manufacturer; and he
in his turn cuts down the wages of the workpeople,
who fear to refuse offers at the warehouse
price, knowing the low rate at which chamber-masters
will serve the warehouse.”</p>

<p>As in all trades where lowness of wages is the
rule, the boy system of labour prevails among the
cheap cabinet-workers. It prevails, however, among
the garret-masters, by very many of them having
one, two, three or four youths to help them, and
so the number of boys thus employed through the
whole trade is considerable. This refers principally
to the general cabinet trade. In the fancy
trade the number is greater, as the boys’ labour
is more readily available; but in this trade the
greatest number of apprentices is employed by
such warehousemen as are manufacturers, as some
at the East end are, or rather by the men that
they constantly keep at work. Of these men, one
has now eight and another fourteen boys in his
service, some apprenticed, some merely “engaged”
and dischargeable at pleasure. A sharp boy, in
six or eight months, becomes “handy;” but four
out of five of the workmen thus brought up can
do nothing well but their own particular branch,
and that only well as far as celerity in production
is considered.</p>

<p>It is these boys who are put to make, or as
a master of the better class distinguished to me,
not to <i>make</i> but to put together, ladies’ work-boxes
at 5<i>d.</i> a piece, the boy receiving 2&frac12;<i>d.</i>
a box. ‘Such boxes,’ said another workman,
‘are nailed together; there’s no dove-tailing,
nothing of what I call <i>work</i>, or workmanship, as
you say, about them, but the deal’s nailed together,
and the veneer’s dabbed on, and if the deal’s
covered, why the thing passes. The worst of it
is, that people don’t understand either good work
or good wood. Polish them up and they look
well. Besides&mdash;and that’s another bad thing, for
it encourages bad work&mdash;there’s no stress on a
lady’s work-box, as on a chair or a sofa, and so
bad work lasts far too long, though not half so
long as good; in solids especially, if not in veneers.’</p>

<p>To such a pitch is this demand for children’s
labour carried, that there is a market in Bethnal-green,
where boys and girls stand twice a week
to be hired as binders and sewers. Hence it will
be easily understood that it is impossible for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
skilled and grown artizan to compete with the
labour of mere children, who are thus literally
brought into the market to undersell him!</p>

<p>Concerning this market for boys and girls, in
Bethnal-green, I received, during my inquiries
into the boot and shoe trade, the following statements
from shopkeepers on the <span class="lock">spot:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> has lived there sixteen years.
The market-days are Monday and Tuesday mornings,
from seven to nine. The ages of persons
who assemble there vary from ten to twenty, and
they are often of the worst character, and a decided
nuisance to the inhabitants. A great
many of both sexes congregate together, and most
market days there are three females to one male.
They consist of sewing boys, shoe-binders, winders
for weavers, and girls for all kinds of slop needlework,
girls for domestic work, nursing children,
&amp;c. No one can testify, for a fact, that they (the
females) are prostitutes; but, by their general
conduct, they are fit for anything. The market,
some years since, was held at the top of Abbey-street;
but, on account of the nuisance, it was
removed to the other end of Abbey-street. When
the schools were built, the nuisance became so
intolerable that it was removed to a railway arch
in White-street, Bethnal-green. There are two
policemen on market mornings to keep order, but
my informant says they require four to maintain
anything like subjection.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But <i>family work, or the conjoint labour of a
workman’s wife and children</i>, is an equally extensive
cause of surplus and casual labour.</p>

<p>A small master, working, perhaps, upon goods
to be supplied at the lowest rates to wholesale
warehousemen, will often contribute to this result
by the way in which he brings up his children.
It is less expensive to him to teach them his own
business, and he may even reap a profit from their
labour, than to have them brought up to some
other calling. I met with an instance of this in
an inquiry among the toy-makers. A maker of
common toys brought up five children to his own
trade, for boys and girls can be made useful in
such labour at an early age. His business fell off
rapidly, which he attributed to the great and
numerous packages of cheap toys imported from
Germany, Holland, and France, after the lowering
of the duty by Sir Robert Peel’s tariff. The
chief profit to the toy-maker was derived from the
labour, as the material was of trifling cost. He
found, on the change in his trade, that he could
not employ all his family. His fellow tradesmen,
he said, were in the same predicament; and thus
surplus hands were created, so leading to casualty
in labour.</p>

<p>“The system which has, I believe, the worst
effect on the women’s trade in the boot and shoe
business throughout England is,” I said in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, “chamber-mastering. There
are between 300 and 400 chamber-masters. Commonly
the man has a wife, and three or four children,
ten years old or upwards. The wife cuts
out the work for the binders, the husband does
the knife-work, the children sew with uncommon
rapidity. The husband, when the work is finished
at night, goes out with it, though wet and cold,
and perhaps hungry&mdash;his wife and children waiting
his return. He returns sometimes, having
sold his work at cost price, or not cleared 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for the day’s labour of himself and family. In
the winter, by this means, the shopkeepers and
warehouses can take the advantage of the chamber-master,
buying the work at their own price.
By this means haberdashers’ shops are supplied
with boots, shoes, and slippers; they can sell
women’s boots at 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per pair; shoes, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
per pair; children’s, 6<i>d.</i>, 8<i>d.</i>, and 9<i>d.</i> per pair,
getting a good profit, having bought them of the
poor chamber-master for almost nothing, and he
glad to sell them at any price, late at night, his
children wanting bread, and he having walked
about for hours, in vain trying to get a fair price
for them; thus, women and children labour as
well as husbands and fathers, and, with their
combined labours, they only obtain a miserable
living.”</p>

<p>The labour of the wife, and indeed the whole
family&mdash;family work, as it is called&mdash;is attended
with the same evil to a trade, introducing a large
supply of fresh hands to the labour market, and
so tending to glut with workpeople each trade
into which they are introduced, and thus to
increase the casual labour, and decrease the earnings
of the whole.</p>

<p>“The only means of escape from the inevitable
poverty,” I said in the same letters, “which
sooner or later overwhelms those in connection
with the cheap shoe trade, seems to the workmen
to be by the employment of his whole family as
soon as his children are able to be put to the
trade&mdash;and yet this only increases the very depression
that he seeks to avoid. I give the statement
of such a man residing in the suburbs of
London, and working with three girls to help
<span class="lock">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘I have known the business,’ he said, ‘many
years, but was not brought up to it. I took it up
because my wife’s father was in the trade, and
taught me. I was a weaver originally, but it is
a bad business, and I have been in this trade
seventeen years. Then I had only my wife and
myself able to work. At that time my wife and
I, by hard work, could earn 1<i>l.</i> a week; on the
same work we could not now earn 12<i>s.</i> a week.
As soon as the children grew old enough the
falling off in the wages compelled us to put them
to work one by one&mdash;as soon as a child could
make threads. One began to do that between
eight and nine. I have had a large family, and
with very hard work too. We have had to lie
on straw oft enough. Now, three daughters, my
wife, and myself work together, in chamber-mastering;
the whole of us may earn, one week
with another, 28<i>s.</i> a week, and out of that I have
eight to support. Out of that 28<i>s.</i> I have to pay
for grindery and candles, which cost me 1<i>s.</i> a
week the year through. I now make children’s
shoes for the wholesale houses and anybody.
About two years ago I travelled from Thomas-street,
Bethnal-green, to Oxford-street, “on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
hawk.” I then positively had nothing in my inside,
and in Holborn I had to lean against a
house, through weakness from hunger. I was
compelled, as I could sell nothing at that end of
the town, to walk down to Whitechapel at ten at
night. I went into a shop near Mile-end turnpike,
and the same articles (children’s patent
leather shoes) that I received 8<i>s.</i> a dozen for
from the wholesale houses, I was compelled to
sell to the shopkeeper for 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> This is a very
frequent case&mdash;very frequent&mdash;with persons circumstanced
as I am, and so trade is injured and
only some hard man gains by it.’”</p>

<p>Here is the statement of a worker at “fancy
cabinet” work on the same <span class="lock">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The most on us has got large families. We
put the children to work as soon as we can. My
little girl began about six, but about eight or nine
is the usual age.” <i>“Oh, poor little things,” said
the wife, “they are obliged to begin the very minute
they can use their fingers at all.”</i> “The most of
the cabinet-makers of the East end have from five
to six in family, and they are generally all at
work for them. The small masters mostly marry
when they are turned of 20. You see our trade’s
coming to such a pass, that unless a man has
children to help him he can’t live at all. <i>I’ve
worked more than a month together, and the
longest night’s rest I’ve had has been an hour and
a quarter; aye, and I’ve been up three nights a
week besides.</i> I’ve had my children lying ill,
and been obliged to wait on them into the bargain.
You see, we couldn’t live if it wasn’t for
the labour of our children, though it makes ’em&mdash;poor
little things!&mdash;old people long afore they are
growed up.”</p>

<p>“Why, I stood at this bench,” said the wife,
“with my child, only ten years of age, from four
o’clock on Friday morning till ten minutes past
seven in the evening, without a bit to eat or
drink. I never sat down a minute from the
time I began till I finished my work, and then I
went out to sell what I had done. I walked all
the way from here [Shoreditch] down to the
Lowther Arcade, to get rid of the articles.”
<i>Here she burst out in a violent flood of tears,
saying, “Oh, sir, it is hard to be obliged to labour
from morning till night as we do, all of us,
little ones and all, and yet not be able to live by
it either.”</i></p>

<p>“And you see the worst of it is, this here
children’s labour is of such value now in our
trade, that there’s more brought into the business
every year, so that it’s really for all the world
<i>like breeding slaves</i>. Without my children I
don’t know how we should be able to get along.”
“There’s that little thing,” said the man, pointing
to the girl ten years of age before alluded to, as
she sat at the edge of the bed, “why she works
regularly every day from six in the morning till
ten at night. She never goes to school. We
can’t spare her. There’s schools enough about
here for a penny a week, but we could not afford
to keep her without working. If I’d ten more
children I should be obliged to employ them all
the same way, and there’s hundreds and thousands
of children now slaving at this business.
There’s the <span class="lock">M&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s; they have a family of
eight, and the youngest to the oldest of all works
at the bench; and the oldest ain’t fourteen. I’m
sure, of the 2500 small masters in the cabinet
line, you may safely say that 2000 of them, at
the very least, has from five to six in family, <i>and
that’s upwards of</i> 12,000 <i>children that’s been
put to the trade since prices has come down</i>.
Twenty years ago I don’t think there was a child
at work in our business; and I am sure there is
not a small master now whose whole family doesn’t
assist him. But what I want to know is, what’s
to become of the 12,000 children when they’re
growed up, and come regular into the trade?
Here are all my young ones growing up without
being taught anything but a business that I know
they must starve at.”</p>

<p>In answer to my inquiry as to what dependence
he had in case of sickness, “Oh, bless you,” he
said, “there’s nothing but the parish for us. I
<i>did</i> belong to a Benefit Society about four years
ago, but I couldn’t keep up my payments any
longer. I was in the society above five-and-twenty
year, and then was obliged to leave it
after all. I don’t know of one as belongs to
any Friendly Society, and I don’t think there is
a man as can afford it in our trade now. They
must all go to the workhouse when they’re sick
or old.”</p>

<p>The following is from a journeyman tailor, concerning
the employment of women in his <span class="lock">trade:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“When I first began working at this branch,
there were but very few females employed in it: a
few white waistcoats were given out to them, under
the idea that women would make them cleaner than
men&mdash;and so indeed they can. But since the last
five years the sweaters have employed females
upon cloth, silk, and satin waistcoats as well, and
before that time the idea of a woman making a
cloth waistcoat would have been scouted. But
since the increase of the puffing and the sweating
system, masters and sweaters have sought everywhere
for such hands as would do the work below
the regular ones. Hence the wife has been made
to compete with the husband, and the daughter
with the wife: they all learn the waistcoat business,
and must all get a living. If the man will
not reduce the price of his labour to that of the
female, why he must remain unemployed; and if
the full-grown woman will not take the work at
the same price as the young girl, why she must
remain without any. The female hands, I can
confidently state, have been sought out and introduced
to the business by the sweaters, from a
desire on their part continually to ferret out hands
who will do the work cheaper than others. The
effect that this continual reduction has had upon
me is this: Before the year 1844 I could live comfortably,
and keep my wife and children (I had
five in family) by my own labour. My wife then
attended to her domestic and family duties; but
since that time, owing to the reduction in prices,
she has been compelled to resort to her needle, as
well as myself, for her living.” [On the table
was a bundle of crape and bombazine ready to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
made up into a dress.] “I cannot afford now to
let her remain idle&mdash;that is, if I wish to live, and
keep my children out of the streets, and pay my
way. My wife’s earnings are, upon an average,
8<i>s.</i> per week. She makes dresses. I never
would teach her to make waistcoats, because I
knew the introduction of female hands had been
the ruin of my trade. With the labour of myself
and wife now I can only earn 32<i>s.</i> a week, and
six years ago I could make my 36<i>s.</i> If I had a
daughter I should be obliged to make her work
as well, and then probably, with the labour of
the three of us, we could make up at the week’s
end as much money, as, up to 1844, I could get
by my own single hands. My wife, since she
took to dressmaking, has become sickly from over-exertion.
Her work, and her domestic and
family duties altogether, are too much for her.
Last night I was up all night with her, and was
compelled to call in a female to attend her as well.
The over-exertion now necessary for us to maintain
a decent appearance, has so ruined her constitution
that she is not the same woman as she
was. In fact, ill as she is, she has been compelled
to rise from her bed to finish a mourning-dress
against time, and I myself have been obliged to
give her a helping-hand, and turn to at women’s
work in the same manner as the women are
turning to at men’s work.”</p>

<p>“The cause of the serious decrease in our
trade,” said another tailor to me, “is the employment
given to workmen at their own homes; or,
in other words, to the ‘sweaters.’ The sweater
is the greatest evil to us; as the sweating system
increases the number of hands to an almost incredible
extent&mdash;wives, sons, daughters, and
extra women, all working ‘long days’&mdash;that is,
labouring from sixteen to eighteen hours per day,
and Sundays as well. I date the decrease in
the wages of the workman from the introduction
of piece-work and giving out garments to be
made off the premises of the master; for the effect
of this was, that the workman making the garment,
knowing that the master could not tell
whom he got to do his work for him, employed
women and children to help him, and paid them
little or nothing for their labour. This was the
beginning of the sweating system. The workmen
gradually became transformed from journeymen
into ‘middlemen,’ living by the labour of others.
Employers soon began to find that they could get
garments made at a less sum than the regular
price, and those tradesmen who were anxious to
force their trade, by underselling their more
honourable neighbours, readily availed themselves
of this means of obtaining cheap labour. The
consequence was, that the sweater sought out
where he could get the work done the cheapest,
and so introduced a fresh stock of hands into the
trade. Female labour, of course, could be had
cheaper than male, and the sweater readily
availed himself of the services of women on that
account. Hence the males who had formerly
been employed upon the garments were thrown
out of work by the females, and obliged to remain
unemployed, unless they would reduce the price
of their work to that of the women. It cannot,
therefore, be said that the reduction of prices
originally arose from there having been more
workmen than there was work for them to do.
There was no superabundance of hands until
female labour was generally introduced&mdash;and
even if the workmen had increased 25 per cent.
more than what they were twenty years back, still
that extra number of hands would be required now
to make the same number of garments, owing to
the work put into each article being at least one-fourth
more than formerly. So far from the trade
being over-stocked with male hands, if the work
were confined to the men or the masters’ premises,
there would not be sufficient hands to do the
whole.”</p>

<p>According to the last Census (1841, G.B.),
out of a population of 18,720,000 the proportions
of the people occupied and unoccupied were as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Occupied</td><td>7,800,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Unoccupied (including women and children)</td><td>10,920,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of those who were occupied the following were
the <span class="lock">proportions:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Engaged in productive employments<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></td><td>5,350,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Engaged in non-productive employments</td><td>2,450,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Of those who were engaged in productive employments,
the proportion (in round numbers)
ran as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Men</td><td>3,785,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Women</td><td>660,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Boys and girls</td><td>905,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here, then, we find nearly one-fifth, or 20 per
cent., of our producers to be boys and girls, and
upwards of 10 per cent. to be women. Such was
the state of things in 1841. In order to judge of
the possible and probable condition of the labour
market of the country, if this introduction of
women and children into the ranks of the
labourers be persisted in, let us see what were
the proportions of the 10,920,000 men, women,
and children who ten years ago still remained
unoccupied among us. The ratio was as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Men</td><td>275,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Women</td><td>3,570,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Boys and girls</td><td>7,075,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here the unoccupied men are about 5 per cent.
of the whole, the children nearly two-thirds, and
the wives about one-third. Now it appears that
out of say 19,000,000 people, 8,000,000 were, in
1841, occupied, and by far the greater number,
11,000,000, unoccupied.</p>

<p>Who were the remaining eleven millions, and
what were they doing? They, of course, consisted
principally of the unemployed wives and
children of the eight millions of people before
specified, three millions and a half of the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
being females of twenty years of age and upwards,
and seven millions being children of both sexes
under twenty. Of these children, four millions,
according to the “age abstract,” were under ten
years, so that we may fairly assume that, at the
time of taking the last census, <i>there were very
nearly seven millions of wives and children of a
workable age still unoccupied</i>. Let us suppose,
then, that these seven millions of people are brought
in competition with the five million producers.
What is to be the consequence? If the labour
market be overstocked at present with only five
millions of people working for the support of
nineteen millions (I speak according to the Census
of 1841), what would it be if another seven
millions were to be dragged into it? And if
wages are low now, and employment is precarious
on account of this, what will not both work
and pay sink to when the number is again increased,
and the people clamouring for employment
are at least treble what they are at present? When
the wife has been taught to compete for work with
the husband, and son and daughter to undersell
their own father, what will be the state of our
labour market then?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the labour of wives, and children, and
apprentices, is not the only means of glutting a
particular trade with hands. There is another
system becoming every day more popular with our
enterprising tradesmen, and this is the <i>importation
of foreign labourers</i>. In the cheap tailoring this
is made a regular practice. Cheap labour is regularly
imported, not only from Ireland (the wives
of sweaters making visits to the Emerald Isle for
the express purpose), but small armies of working
tailors, ready to receive the lowest pittance, are
continually being shipped into this country. That
this is no exaggeration let the following statement
<span class="lock">prove:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am a native of Pesth, having left Hungary
about eight years ago. By the custom of the
country I was compelled to travel three years in
foreign parts, before I could settle in my native
place. I went to Paris, after travelling about in
the different countries of Germany. I stayed in
Paris about two years. My father’s wish was
that I should visit England, and I came to London
in June, 1847. I first worked for a West end show
shop&mdash;not <i>directly</i> for them&mdash;but through the
person who is their middleman getting work done
at what rates he could for the firm, and obtaining
the prices they allowed for making the garments.
I once worked four days and a half for him,
finding my own trimmings, &amp;c., for 9<i>s.</i> For this
my employer would receive 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> He then
employed 190 hands; he <i>has</i> employed 300.
Many of those so employed set their wives,
children, and others to work, some employing as
many as five hands this way. The middleman
keeps his carriage, and will give fifty guineas for
a horse. I became unable to work from a pain
in my back, from long sitting at my occupation.
The doctor told me not to sit much, and so, as a
countryman of mine was doing the same, I employed
hands, making the best I could of their
labour. I have now four young women (all Irish
girls) so employed. Last week one of them received
4<i>s.</i>, another 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, the other two 5<i>s.</i> each.
They find their board and lodging, but I find
them a place to work in, a small room, the rent of
which I share with another tailor, who works on
his own account. There are not so many Jews
come over from Hungary or Germany as from
Poland. The law of travelling three years brings
over many, but not more than it did. The revolutions
have brought numbers this year and last.
They are Jew tailors flying from Russian and
Prussian Poland to avoid the conscription. I never
knew any of these Jews go back again. <i>There
is a constant communication among the Jews, and
when their friends in Poland, and other places,
learn they are safe in England, and in work and
out of trouble, they come over too. I worked as a
journeyman in Pesth, and got</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d. a week, my
board and washing, and lodging, for my labour.</i>
We lived well, everything being so cheap. The
Jews come in the greatest number about Easter.
They try to work their way here, most of them.
Some save money here, but they never go back;
if they leave England it is to go to America.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The labour market of a particular place, however,
comes to be overstocked with hands, not
only from the introduction of an inordinate number
of apprentices and women and children into the
trade, as well as the importation of workmen from
abroad, but the same effect is produced by <i>the
migration of country labourers to towns</i>. This,
as I have before said, is specially the case in the
printer’s and carpenter’s trades, where the cheap
provincial work is executed chiefly by apprentices,
who, when their time is up, flock to the principal
towns, in the hopes of getting better wages than can
be obtained in the country, owing to the prevalence
of the apprentice system of work in those parts.
The London carpenters suffer greatly from what
are called “improvers,” who come up to town to
get perfected in their art, and work for little or no
wages. The work of some of the large houses is executed
mainly in this way; that of Mr. Myers was,
for instance, against whom the men lately struck.</p>

<p>But the unskilled labour of towns suffers far
more than the skilled from the above cause.</p>

<p>The employment of unskilled labourers in
towns is being constantly rendered more casual
by the migrations from the country parts. The
peasants, owing to the insufficiency of their
wages, and the wretchedness of their dwellings
and diet, in Wilts, Somerset, Dorset, and elsewhere,
leave their native places without regret,
and swell the sum of unskilled labour in towns.
This is shown by the increase of population far
beyond the excess of births over deaths in those
counties where there are large manufacturing or
commercial towns; whilst in purely agricultural
counties the increase of population does not keep
pace with the excess of births. “Thus in Lancashire,”
writes Mr. Thornton, in his work on
Over-Population, “the increase of the population
in the ten years ending in 1841, was 330,210,
and in Cheshire, 60,919; whilst the excess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
births was only 150,150 in the former, and
28,000 in the latter. In particular towns the
contrast is still more striking. In Liverpool and
Bristol the annual deaths actually exceed the
births, so that these towns are only saved from
depopulation by their rural recruits, yet the first
increased the number of its inhabitants in ten
years by more than one-third, and the other by
more than one-sixth. In Manchester, the annual
excess of births could only have added 19,390
to the population between 1831 and 1841; the
actual increase was 68,375. The number of emigrants
(immigrants) into Birmingham, during the
same period, may, in the same way, be estimated
at 40,000; into Leeds, at 8000; into the metropolis,
at 130,000. On the other hand, in
Dorset, Somerset, and Devon, the actual addition
to the population, in the same decennial period,
was only 15,491, 31,802, and 39,253 respectively;
although the excess of births over deaths in the
same counties was about 20,000, 38,600, and
48,700.”</p>

<p>The unskilled labour market suffers, again, from
the depression of almost any branch of skilled
labour; for whatever branch of labour be depressed,
and men so be deprived of a sufficiency
of employment, one especial result ensues&mdash;the
unskilled labour market is glutted. The skilled
labourer, a tailor, for instance, may be driven to
work for the wretched pittance of an East end
slop-tailor, but he cannot “turn his hand” to any
other description of skilled labour. He cannot
say, “I will make billiard-tables, or book-cases,
or boots, or razors;” so that there is no resource
for him but in unskilled labour. The Spitalfields
weavers have often sought dock labour; the
turners of the same locality, whose bobbins were
once in great demand by the silk-winders, and
for the fringes of upholsterers, have done the
same; and in this way the increase of casual
labour increases the poverty of the poor, and so
tends directly to the increase of pauperism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now seen what a vast number of surplus
labourers may be produced by an extension
of time, rate, or mode of working, as well as by
the increase of the hands, by other means than
by <i>the increase of the people themselves</i>. If, however,
we are increasing our workers at a greater
rate than we are increasing the means of work,
the excess of workmen must, of course, remain
unemployed. But are we doing this?</p>

<p>Let us test the matter on the surest data. In
the first instance let us estimate the increase of
population, both according to the calculations of
the late Mr. Rickman and the returns of the several
censuses. The first census, I may observe, was
taken in 1801, and has been regularly continued
at intervals of ten years. The table first given
refers to the population of England and <span class="lock">Wales:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Discarding, then, all conjectural results, and adhering
solely to the returns of the censuses, we
find that, according to the official numberings of
the people <i>throughout the kingdom</i>, the increased
rate of population is, in round numbers, 10 per
cent. every ten years; that is to say, where 100
persons were living in the United Kingdom in
1821, there are 130 living in the present year
of 1851. The average increase in England and
Wales for the last 50 years may, however, be
said to be 1·5 per cent. per annum, the population
having doubled itself during that period.</p>

<p>How, then, does this rate of increase among the
people, and consequently the labourers and artizans
of the country, correspond with the rate of increase
in the production of commodities, or, in
plain English, the means of employment? <i>This</i>
is the main inquiry.</p>

<p>The only means of determining the total amount
of commodities produced, and consequently the
quantity of work done in the country, is from official
returns, submitted to the Parliament and the
public as part of the “revenue” of the kingdom.
These afford a broad and accurate basis for the
necessary statistics; and to get rid of any speculating
or calculating on the subject, I will confine
my notice to such commodities; giving, however,
further information bearing on the subject, but
still derived from official sources, so that there
may be no doubt on the matter. The facts in
connection with this part of the subject are exhibited
in the table given in the next page.</p>

<p>The majority of the articles there specified
supply the elements of trade and manufacture in
furnishing the materials of our clothing, in all its
appliances of decency, comfort, and luxury. The
table relates, moreover, to our commerce with
other countries&mdash;to the ships which find profitable
employment, and give such employment to our
people, in the aggregate commerce of the nation.
Under almost every head, it will be seen, the increase
in the means of labour has been more extensive
than has the increase in the number of labourers;
in some instances the difference is wide
indeed.</p>

<p>The annual rate of increase among the population
has been ·9 per cent. From 1801 to 1841 the
population of the kingdom at the outside cannot be
said to have doubled itself. Yet the productions
in cotton goods <i>were not less than ten times greater
in 1851 than in 1801</i>. The increase in the use of
wool from 1821 to 1851 was more than sixfold;
that of the population, I may repeat, <i>not</i> twofold. In
<i>twenty</i> years (1831 to 1851) the hides were more
than doubled in amount as a means of production;
in <i>fifty</i> years the population has not increased to
the same amount. Can any one, then, contend
that the labouring population has extended itself
at a greater rate than the means of labour, or
that the vast mass of surplus labour throughout
the country is owing to the working classes having
increased more rapidly than the means of employing
them?</p>

<p>Thus, it is evident, that the means of labour
have increased at a more rapid pace than the
labouring population. But the increase in “property”
of the country, in that which is sometimes
called the “staple” property, being the assured
possessions of the class of proprietors or capitalists,
as well as in the profits, prove that, if the
labourers of the country have been hungering for
want of employment, at least the wealth of the
nation has kept pace with the increase of the people,
while the profits of trade have exceeded it.</p>

1·7 per cent. every year, whereas the population
of Great Britain has increased at the rate of only 1·4
per cent. per annum. But the amount of assessment
under the property tax, it should be borne
in mind, does not represent the full value of the
possessions, so that among this class of proprietors
there is far greater wealth than the returns show.</p>

<p>As regards the annual profits of trade, the increase
between the years 1815 and 1844 has been
23,000,000<i>l.</i> in 29 years. This is at the rate of
1·7 per cent. per annum, and the annual increase
in the population of Great Britain is only 1·4 per
cent. But the amount of the profits of trade is
unquestionably greater than appears in the financial
tables of the revenue of the country; consequently
there is a greater increase of wealth over

<p>Far, very far indeed then, beyond the increase

<p>And now, after this imposing array of wealth,
let us contemplate the reverse of the picture: let

also in the sad long lists of paupers and
criminals. Has our progress in poverty and crime
been “<i>pari passu</i>,” or been more than commensurate

<p>Here, then, we have an increase of 56 per cent.
in less than ten years, though the increase of the
population of England and Wales, in the same
time, was but 13 per cent.; and let it be remembered
that the increase of upwards of 650,000 paupers,
in nine years, has accrued since the New Poor
Law has been in what may be considered full
working; a law which many were confident would
result in a diminution of pauperism, and which certainly
cannot be charged with offering the least
encouragement to it. Still in <i>nine</i> years, our poverty
increases while our wealth increases, and our paupers
grow nearly four times as quick as our people,
while the profits on trade nearly double themselves
in little more than a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>From these results&mdash;and such figures are facts,
and therefore stubborn things&mdash;the people cannot
be said to have increased beyond the wealth or
the means of employing them, for it is evident
that <i>we increase in poverty and crime as we increase
in wealth, and in both far beyond our
increase in numbers</i>. The above are the bare facts
of the country&mdash;it is for the reader to explain
them as he pleases.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As yet we have dealt with those causes of
casual labour only which may induce a surplusage
of labourers without any <i>decrease taking place in
the quantity of work</i>. We have seen, first, how
the number of the unemployed may be increased
either by altering the hours, rate, or mode of
working, or else by changing the term of hiring,
and this while the number of labourers remains
the same; and, secondly, we have seen how the
same results may ensue from increasing the number
of labourers, while the conditions of working
and hiring are unaltered. Under both these
circumstances, however, the actual quantity of
work to be done in the country has been supposed
to undergo no change whatever; and at present
we have to point out not only how the amount of
surplus, and, consequently, of casual labour, in
the kingdom, may be increased by <i>a decrease of
the work</i>, but also how the work itself may be
made to decrease. To know the causes of the
one we must ascertain the antecedents of the
other. What, then, are the circumstances inducing
a decrease in the quantity of work? and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
consequently, what the circumstances inducing an
increase in the amount of surplus and casual
labour?</p>

<p>In the first place we may induce a large
amount of casual labour <i>in particular districts</i>,
not by decreasing the gross quantity of work required
by the country, but by merely shifting
the work into new quarters, and so decreasing
the quantity in the ordinary localities. “The
west of England,” says Mr. Dodd, in his account
of the textile manufactures of Great Britain,
“was formerly, and continued to be till a
comparatively recent period, the most important
clothing district in England. The changes
which the woollen manufacture, as respects both
localization and mode of management, has been
and is now undergoing, are very remarkable.
Some years ago the ‘west of England cloths’
were the test of excellence in this manufacture;
while the productions of Yorkshire were
deemed of a coarser and cheaper character. At
present, although the western counties have not
deteriorated in their product, the West Riding of
Yorkshire has made giant strides, by which equal
skill in every department has been attained;
while the commercial advantages resulting from
coal-mines, from water-power, from canals and
railroads, and from vicinage to the eastern port of
Hull and the western port of Liverpool, give to
the West Riding a power which Gloucestershire
and Somersetshire cannot equal. The steam-engine,
too, and various machines for facilitating
some of the manufacturing processes, have been
more readily introduced into the former than into
the latter; a circumstance which, even without
reference to other points of comparison, is sufficient
to account for much of the recent advance in
the north.”</p>

<p>Of late years the products of many of the west
of England clothing districts have considerably
declined. Shepton Mallet, Frome and Trowbridge,
for instance, which were at one time the seats of a
flourishing manufacture for cloth, have now but
little employment for the workmen in those parts;
and so with other towns. “At several places in
Wiltshire, Somersetshire, and Gloucestershire,
and others of the western counties,” says Mr.
Thornton, “most of the cottagers, fifty years ago,
were weavers, whose chief dependence was their
looms, though they worked in the field at harvest
time and other busy seasons. By so doing they
kept down the wages of agricultural labourers,
who had no other employment; and now that
they have themselves become dependent upon
agriculture, in consequence of the removal of the
woollen manufacture from the cottage to the
factory” [as well as to the north of England],
“these reduced wages have become their own
portion also;” or, in other words, since the
shifting of the woollen manufacture in these
parts, the quantity of casual labour in the
cultivation of the land has been augmented.</p>

<p>The same effect takes place, of course, if the
work be shifted to the Continent, instead of
merely to another part of our own country. This
has been the main cause of the misery of the
straw-plaiters of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire.
“During the last war,” says the author
before quoted, “there were examples of women
(the wives and children of labouring men) earning
as much as 22<i>s.</i> a week. The profits of this
employment have been so much reduced by the
competition of Leghorn hats and bonnets, that a
straw-plaiter cannot earn much more than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
in the week.”</p>

<p>But the work of particular localities may not
only decrease, and the casual labour, in those
parts, increase in the same proportion, by shifting
it to other localities (either at home or abroad),
even while the gross quantity of work required
by the nation remains the same, but the quantity
of work may be less than ordinary at <i>a particular
time</i>, even while the same gross quantity annually
required undergoes no change. This is the case
in those periodical gluts which arise from over-production,
in the cotton and other trades. The
manufacturers, in such cases, have been increasing
the supplies at a too rapid rate in proportion to
the demand of the markets, so that, though there
be no decrease in the requirements of the country,
there ultimately accrues such a surplus of commodities
beyond the wants and means of the people,
that the manufacturers are compelled to stop producing
until such time as the regular demand
carries off the extra supply. And during all this
time either the labourers have to work half-time
at half-pay, or else they are thrown out of employment
altogether.</p>

<p>Thus far we have proceeded in the assumption
that the actual quantity of work required by the
nation <i>does not decrease in the aggregate, but only
in particular places or at particular times</i>, owing
to a greater quantity than usual being done in
other places or at other times<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. We have still to
consider what are the circumstances which tend to
<i>diminish the gross quantity of work required by
the country</i>. To understand these we must know
the conditions on which all work depends; these
are simply the conditions of demand and supply,
and hence to know what it is that regulates
the demand for commodities, and what it is that regulates
the supply of them, is also to know what it is
that regulates the quantity of work required by
the nation.</p>

<p>Let me begin with the decrease of work arising
from a <i>decrease of the demand</i> for certain commodities.
This decrease of demand may proceed
from one of three <span class="lock">causes:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. An increase of cost.</li>
<li>2. A change of taste or fashion.</li>
<li>3. A change of circumstances.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <i>increase of cost</i> may be brought about
either by an increase in the expense of production
or by a tax laid upon the article, as in the case
of hair-powder, before quoted. Of the <i>change
of taste or fashion</i>, as a means of decreasing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
demand for a certain article of manufacture,
and, consequently, of a particular form of labour,
many instances have already been given; to these
the following may be added:&mdash;“In Dorsetshire,”
says Mr. Thornton, “the making of wire shirt-buttons
(now in a great measure superseded by
the use of mother-o’-pearl) once employed great
numbers of women and children.” So it has been
with the manufacture of metal coat-buttons; the
change to silk has impoverished hundreds.</p>

<p>The decrease of work arising from a <i>change of
circumstances</i> may be seen in the fluctuations of
the iron trade; in the railway excitement the
demand for labour in the iron districts was at
least tenfold as great as it is at present, and so
again with the demand for arms during war time;
at such periods the quantity of work in that particular
line at Birmingham is necessarily increased,
while the contrary effects, of course, ensue immediately
the requirements cease, and a large mass
of surplus and casual hands is the result. It is
the same with the soldiers themselves, as with the
gun and sword makers; on the disbanding of
certain portions of the army at the conclusion of a
war, a vast amount of surplus labourers are
poured into the country to compete with those
already in work, and either to drag down their
weekly earnings, or else, by obtaining <i>casual</i>
employment in their stead, to reduce the gross
quantity of work accruing to each, and so to
render their incomes not only less in amount but
less constant and regular. Within the last few
weeks no less than 1000 policemen employed
during the Exhibition have been discharged, of
course with a like result to the labour market.</p>

<p>The circumstances tending to <i>diminish the supply</i>
of certain commodities, <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>


<ul><li>1. Want of capital.</li>
<li>2. Want of materials.</li>
<li>3. Want of labourers.</li>
<li>4. Want of opportunity.</li></ul>



<p>The <i>decrease of the quantity of capital</i> in a trade
may be brought about by several means: it may
be produced by a want of security felt among the
moneyed classes, as at the time of revolutions,
political agitations, commercial depressions, or
panics; or it may be produced by a deficiency of
enterprise after the bursting of certain commercial
“bubbles,” or the decline of particular manias for
speculation, as on the cessation of the railway excitement;
so, again, it may be brought about by
a failure of the ordinary produce of the year, as
with bad harvests.</p>

<p>The <i>decrease of the quantity of materials</i>, as
tending to diminish the supply of certain commodities,
may be seen in the failure of the cotton
crops, which, of course, deprive the cotton manufacturers
of their ordinary quantity of work.
The same diminution in the ordinary supply of
particular articles ensues when the men engaged
in the production of them “strike” either for an
advance of wages, or more generally to resist the
attempt of some cutting employer to reduce their
ordinary earnings; and lastly, a like decrease of
work necessarily ensues when the <i>opportunity of
working is changed</i>. Some kinds of work, as we
have already seen, depend on the weather&mdash;on
either the wind, rain, or temperature; while other
kinds can only be pursued at certain seasons of the
year, as brick-making, building, and the like;
hence, on the cessation of the opportunities for
working in these trades, there is necessarily a great
decrease in the quantity of work, and consequently
a large increase in the amount of surplus and
therefore casual labour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now, I believe, exhausted the several
causes of that vast national evil&mdash;casual labour.
We have seen that it depends,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First, upon certain times and seasons, fashions
and accidents, which tend to cause a periodical
briskness or slackness in different
employments;</p>

<p>And secondly, upon the number of surplus
labourers in the country.</p></div>

<p>The circumstances inducing surplus labour we
have likewise ascertained to be three.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. An alteration in the hours, rate, or mode
of working, as well as in the mode of
hiring.</p>

<p>2. An increase of the hands.</p>

<p>3. A decrease of the work, either in particular
places, at particular times, or in the aggregate,
owing to a decrease either in the
demand or means of supply.</p></div>

<p>Any one of these causes, it has been demonstrated,
must necessarily tend to induce an over
supply of labourers and consequently a casualty of
labour, for it has been pointed out that an over
supply of labourers does not depend <i>solely</i> on an
increase of the workers beyond the means of working,
but that a decrease of the ordinary quantity
of work, or a general increase of the hours or rate
of working, or an extension of the system of production,
or even a diminution of the term of hiring,
will also be attended with the same result&mdash;facts
which should be borne steadily in mind by all
those who would understand the difficulties of the
times, and which the “economists” invariably
ignore.</p>

<p>On a careful revision of the whole of the circumstances
before detailed, I am led to believe
that there is considerable truth in the statement
lately put forward by the working classes, that only
one-third of the operatives of this country are fully
employed, while another third are partially employed,
and the remaining third wholly unemployed;
that is to say, estimating the working
classes as being between four and five millions in
number, I think we may safely assert&mdash;considering
how many depend for their employment on particular
times, seasons, fashions, and accidents, and
the vast quantity of over-work and scamp-work in
nearly all the cheap trades of the present day, the
number of women and children who are being continually
drafted into the different handicrafts with
the view of reducing the earnings of the men, the
displacement of human labour in some cases by
machinery, and the tendency to increase the division
of labour, and to extend the large system
of production beyond the requirements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
markets, as well as the temporary mode of hiring&mdash;all
these things being considered, I say I believe
we may safely conclude that, out of the four
million five hundred thousand people who have
to depend on their industry for the livelihood of
themselves and families, there is (owing to the extraordinary
means of economizing labour which
have been developed of late years, and the discovery
as to how to do the work of the nation
with fewer people) barely sufficient work for the
<i>regular</i> employment of half of our labourers, so
that only 1,500,000 are fully and constantly employed,
while 1,500,000 more are employed only
half their time, and the remaining 1,500,000
wholly unemployed, obtaining a day’s work <i>occasionally</i>
by the displacement of some of the others.</p>

<p>Adopt what explanation we will of this appalling
deficiency of employment, one thing at
least is certain: we cannot <i>consistently with the
facts of the country</i>, ascribe it to an increase of
the population beyond the means of labour; for
we have seen that, while the people have increased
during the last fifty years at the rate
of ·9 per cent. per annum, the wealth and productions
of the kingdom have far exceeded that
amount.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Casual Labourers among the
Rubbish-Carters.</span></h3>

<p>The casual labour of so large a body of men as
the rubbish-carters is a question of high importance,
for it affects the whole unskilled labour
market. And this is one of the circumstances
distinguishing unskilled from skilled labour.
Unemployed cabinet-makers, for instance, do not
apply for work to a tailor; so that, with skilled
labourers, only one trade is affected in the slack
season by the scarcity of employment among
its operatives. With unskilled labourers it is
otherwise. If in the course of next week 100 rubbish-carters
were from any cause to be thrown out
of employment, and found an impossibility to
obtain work at rubbish-carting, there would be
100 fresh applicants for employment among the
bricklayer’s-labourers, scavagers, nightmen, sewermen,
dock-workers, lumpers, &amp;c. Many of the 100
thus unemployed would, of course, be willing to
work at reduced wages merely that they might
subsist; and thus the hands employed by the
regular and “honourable” part of those trades
are exposed to the risk of being underworked, as
regards wages, from the surplusage of labour in
other unskilled occupations.</p>

<p>The employment of the rubbish-carters depends,
in the first instance, upon the <i>season</i>. The
services of the men are called into requisition
when houses are being built or removed. In
the one case, the rubbish-carters cart away the
refuse earth; in the other they remove the old
materials. The <i>brisk season</i> for the builders, and
consequently for the rubbish-carters, is, as I heard
several of them express it, “when days are long.”
From about the middle of April to the middle of
October is the <i>brisk</i> season of the rubbish-carters,
for during those six months more buildings are
erected than in the winter half of the year. There
is an advantage in fine weather in the masonry
becoming <i>set</i>; and efforts are generally made to
complete at least the carcase of a house before the
end of October, at the latest.</p>

<p>I am informed that the difference in the employment
of labourers about buildings is 30 per
cent.&mdash;one builder estimated it at 50 per cent.&mdash;less
in winter than in summer, from the circumstance
of fewer buildings being then in the course
of erection. It may be thought that, as rubbish-carters
are employed frequently on the foundation
of buildings, their business would not be greatly
affected by the season or the weather. But the
work is often more difficult in wet weather, the
ground being heavier, so that a smaller extent of
work only can be accomplished, compared to
what can be done in fine weather; and an employer
may decline to pay six days’ wages for
work in winter, which he might get done in five
days in summer. If the men work by the piece
or the load the result is the same; the rubbish-carter’s
employer has a smaller return, for there is
less work to be charged to the customer, while the
cost in keeping the horses is the same.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that under the most favourable
circumstances about <i>one-fourth</i> of the rubbish-carters,
even in the honourable trade, may be
exposed to the evils of non-employment merely
from the state of the weather influencing, more or
less, the custom of the trade, and this even during
<i>the</i> six months’ employment out of the year; after
which the men must find some other means of
earning a livelihood.</p>

<p>There are, in round numbers, 850 operative
rubbish-carters employed in the brisk season
throughout the metropolis; hence 212 men, at
this calculation, would be regularly deprived of
work every year for six months out of the twelve.
It will be seen, however, on reference to the table
here given, that the average number of weeks
each of the rubbish-carters is employed throughout
the twelve months is far below 26; indeed
many have but three and four weeks work out of
the 52.</p>

<p>By an analysis of the returns I have collected
on this subject I find the following to have been
the actual term of employment for the several
rubbish-carters in the course of last <span class="lock">year:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence about one-fourth of the trade appear to
have been employed for six months, while upwards
of one-half had work for only three
months or less throughout the year&mdash;many being
at work only three days in the week during that
time.</p>

<p>The rubbish-carter is exposed to another casualty
over which he can no more exercise control
than he can over the weather; I mean to
what is generally called <i>speculation</i>, or a rage for
building. This is evoked by the state of the
money market, and other causes upon which I
need not dilate; but the effect of it upon the
labourers I am describing is this: capitalists may
in one year embark sufficient means in building
speculations to erect, say 500 new houses, in any
particular district. In the following year they
may not erect more than 200 (if any), and thus,
as there is the same extent of unskilled labour in
the market, the number of hands required is, if
the trade be generally less speculative, less in one
year than in its predecessor by the number of rubbish-carters
required to work at the foundations
of 300 houses. Such a cause may be exceptional;
but during the last ten years the inhabited houses
in the five districts of the Registrar-General have
increased to the extent of 45,000, or from 262,737
in 1841, to 307,722 in 1851. It appears, then,
that the annual increase of our metropolitan
houses, concluding that they increase in a regular
yearly ratio, is 4500. Last year, however,
as I am informed by an experienced builder, there
were rather fewer buildings erected (he spoke only
from his own observations and personal knowledge
of the business) than the yearly average of the decennial
term.</p>

<p>The casual and constant wages of the rubbish-carters
may be thus detailed. The whole system
of the labour, I may again state, must be regarded
as <i>casual</i>, or&mdash;as the word imports in its derivation
from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus</i>, a chance&mdash;the labour of men
who are occasionally employed. Some of the
most respectable and industrious rubbish-carters
with whom I met, told me they generally might
make up their minds, though they might have
excellent masters, to be six months of the year
unemployed at rubbish-carting; this, too, is less
than the average of this chance employment.</p>

<p>Calculating, then, the rubbish-carter’s receipt
of <i>nominal wages</i> at 18<i>s.</i>, and his <i>actual wages</i> at
20<i>s.</i> in the honourable trade, I find the following
amount to be paid.</p>

<p>By nominal wages, I have before explained, I
mean what a man is <i>said</i> to receive, or has been
<i>promised</i> that he shall be paid weekly. Actual
wages, on the other hand, are what a man positively
<i>receives</i>, there being sometimes additions
in the form of perquisites or allowances; sometimes
deductions in the way of fines and stoppages;
the additions in the rubbish-carting trade
appear to average about 2<i>s.</i> a week. But these
<i>actual wages</i> are received only so long as the men
are employed, that is to say, they are the <i>casual</i>
rather than the <i>constant</i> earnings of the men
working at a trade, which is essentially of an
occasional or temporary character; the average
employment at rubbish-carting being only three
months in the year.</p>

<p>Let us see, therefore, what would be the constant
earnings or income of the men working at
the better-paid portion of the trade.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td></td><td class="center">£</td><td><i>s.</i></td><td><i>d.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The gross actual wages of ten rubbish-carters, casually employed for 39 weeks, at 20<i>s.</i> per week, amount to</td><td>390</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The gross actual wages of 250 rubbish-carters, casually employed for 26 weeks, at 20<i>s.</i> per week</td><td>6500</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The gross actual wages of 360 rubbish-carters, casually employed for 13 weeks, at 20<i>s.</i> per week</td><td>4600</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total gross actual wages of 620 of the better-paid rubbish-carters</td><td class="total">11,490</td><td class="total">0</td><td class="total">0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>But this, as I said before, represents only the
<i>casual</i> wages of the better-paid operatives&mdash;that
is to say, it shows the amount of money or money’s
worth that is positively received by the men
while they are in employment. To understand
what are the <i>constant</i> wages of these men, we
must divide their gross casual earnings by 52, the
number of weeks in the year: thus we find that
the constant wages of the ten men who were employed
for 39 weeks, were 15<i>s.</i> instead of 20<i>s.</i>
per week&mdash;that is to say, their wages, equally divided
throughout the year, would have yielded that
constant weekly income. By the same reasoning,
the 20<i>s.</i> per week casual wages of the 250 men
employed for 26 weeks out of the 52, were equal
to only 10<i>s.</i> constant weekly wages; and so the
360 men, who had 20<i>s.</i> per week casually for
only three months in the year, had but 5<i>s.</i> a week
<i>constantly</i> throughout the whole year. Hence
we see the enormous difference there may be between
a man’s casual and his constant earnings
at a given trade.</p>

<p>The next question that forces itself on the
mind is, how do the rubbish-carters live when no
longer employed at this kind of work?</p>

<p>When the slack season among rubbish-carters
commences, nearly one-fifth of the operatives are
discharged. These take to scavaging or dustman’s
work, as well as that of navigators, or, indeed, any
form of unskilled labour, some obtaining full employ,
but the greater part being able to “get a
job only now and then.” Those masters who keep
their men on throughout the year are some of
them large dust contractors, some carmen, some
dairymen, and (in one or two instances in the
suburbs, as at Hackney) small farmers. The dust-contractors
and carmen, who are by far the more
numerous, find employment for the men employed
by them as rubbish-carters in the season, either at
the dust-yard or carrying sand, or, indeed, carting
any materials they may have to move&mdash;the wages
to the men remaining the same; indeed such is
the transient character of the rubbish-carting
trade, that there are no masters or operatives who
devote themselves solely to the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Effects of Casual Labour in General.</span></h3>

<p>Having now pointed out the causes of casual
labour, I proceed to set forth its effects.</p>

<p>All casual labour, as I have said, is necessarily
<i>uncertain</i> labour; and wherever uncertainty
exists, there can be no foresight or pro-vidence.
Had the succession of events in nature been irregular,&mdash;had
it been ordained by the Creator that
similar causes under similar circumstances should
<i>not</i> be attended with similar effects,&mdash;it would
have been impossible for us to have had any
knowledge of the future, or to have made any
preparations concerning it. Had the seasons followed
each other fitfully,&mdash;had the sequences in
the external world been variable instead of invariable,
and what are now termed “constants” from
the regularity of their succession been changed
into inconstants,&mdash;what provision could even the
most prudent of us have made? Where all was
dark and unstable, we could only have guessed
instead of reasoned as to what was to come;
and who would have deprived himself of present
enjoyments to avoid future privations, which
could appear neither probable nor even possible
to him? Pro-vidence, therefore, is simply the
result of certainty, and whatever tends to increase
our faith in the uniform sequences of outward
events, as well as our reliance on the means
we have of avoiding the evils connected with
them, necessarily tends to make us more prudent.
Where the means of sustenance and comfort
are fixed, the human being becomes conscious of
what he has to depend upon; and if he feel
<i>assured</i> that such means may fail him in old age
or in sickness, and be fully impressed with the
<i>certainty</i> of suffering from either, he will immediately
proceed to make some provision against
the time of adversity or infirmity. If, however,
his means be <i>uncertain</i>&mdash;abundant at one time,
and deficient at another&mdash;a spirit of speculation or
gambling with the future will be induced, and the
individual get to believe in “luck” and “fate”
as the arbiters of his happiness rather than to
look upon himself as “the architect of his fortunes”&mdash;trusting
to “chance” rather than his own powers
and foresight to relieve him at the hour of necessity.
The same result will necessarily ensue
if, from defective reasoning powers, the ordinary
course of nature be not sufficiently apparent to
him, or if, being in good health, he grow too
confident upon its continuance, and, either from
this or other causes, is led to believe that death
will overtake him before his powers of self-support
decay.</p>

<p>The ordinary effects of uncertain labour, then,
are to drive the labourers to improvidence, recklessness,
and pauperism.</p>

<p>Even in the classes which we do not rank among
labourers, as, for instance, authors, artists, musicians,
actors, uncertainty or irregularity of employment
and remuneration produces a spirit of wastefulness
and carelessness. The steady and daily
accruing gains of trade and of some of the professions
form a certain and staple income; while in
other professions, where a large sum may be realized
at one time, and then no money be earned
until after an interval, incomings are rapidly spent,
and the interval is one of suffering. This is part
of the very nature, the very essence, of the casualty
of employment and the delay of remuneration.
The past privation gives a zest to the present enjoyment;
while the present enjoyment renders the
past privation faint as a remembrance and unimpressive
as a warning. “Want of providence,”
writes Mr. Porter, “on the part of those who live
by the labour of their hands, and whose employments
so often depend upon circumstances beyond
their control, is a theme which is constantly
brought forward by many whose lot in life has
been cast beyond the reach of want. It is, indeed,
greatly to be wished, for their own sakes,
that the habit were general among the labouring
classes of saving some part of their wages when
fully employed, against less prosperous times; but
it is difficult for those who are placed in circumstances
of ease to <i>estimate the amount of virtue
that is implied in this self-denial</i>. It must be a
hard trial for one who has recently, perhaps, seen
his family enduring want, to deny them the small
amount of indulgences, which are, at the best of
times, placed within their reach.”</p>

<p>It is easy enough for men in smooth circumstances
to say, “the privation is a man’s own fault,
since, to avoid it, he has but to apportion the sum
he may receive in a lump over the interval of non-recompense
which he knows will follow.” Such a
course as this, experience and human nature
have shown not to be easy&mdash;perhaps, with a
few exceptions, not to be possible. It is the
starving and not the well-fed man that is in
danger of surfeiting himself. When pestilence or
revolution are rendering life and property <i>casualties</i>
in a country, the same spirit of improvident
recklessness breaks forth. In London, on the last
visitation of the plague, in the reign of Charles
II., a sort of Plague Club indulged in the wildest
excesses in the very heart of the pestilence. To
these orgies no one was admitted who had not been
bereft of some relative by the pest. In Paris,
during the reign of terror in the first revolution,
the famous Guillotine Club was composed of none
but those who had lost some near relative by the
guillotine. When they met for their half-frantic
revels every one wore some symbol of death:
breast pins in the form of guillotines, rings with
death’s-heads, and such like. The duration of
their own lives these Guillotine Clubbists knew to
be uncertain, not merely in the ordinary uncertainty
of nature, but from the character of the
times; and this feeling of the jeopardy of existence,
from the practice of violence and bloodshed,
wrought the effects I have described. Life was
more than naturally casual. When the famine
was at the worst in Ireland, it was remarked in
the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, that in that city there never
had been seen more street “larking” or street
gambling among the poor lads and young men
who were really starving. This was a natural
result of the casualty of labour and the consequent
casualty of food. Persons, it should be
remembered, do not insure houses or shops that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
are “doubly or trebly hazardous;” they gamble
on the uncertainty.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter, in his “Progress of the Nation,”
cites a fact bearing immediately upon the present
subject.</p>

<p>“The formation of a canal, which has been in
progress during the last five years, in the north of
Ireland (this was written in 1847), has afforded
steady employment to a portion of the peasantry,
who before that time were suffering all the evils,
so common in that country, which result from the
precariousness of employment. Such work as they
could previously get came at uncertain intervals,
and was sought by so many competitors, that the
remuneration was of the scantiest amount. In this
condition of things the men were improvident, to
recklessness; their wages, insufficient for the comfortable
sustenance of their families, were wasted
in procuring for themselves a temporary forgetfulness
of their misery at the whiskey-shop, and the
men appeared to be sunk into a state of hopeless
degradation. From the moment, however, that
work was offered to them which was <i>constant in its
nature and certain in its duration</i>, and on which
their weekly earnings would be sufficient to provide
for their comfortable support, <i>men who had
been idle and dissolute were converted into sober
hard-working labourers, and proved themselves
kind and careful husbands and fathers</i>; and it is
stated as a fact, that, notwithstanding the distribution
of several hundred pounds weekly in wages,
the whole of which must be considered as so much
additional money placed in their hands, the consumption
of whiskey was absolutely and <i>permanently</i>
diminished in the district. During the comparatively
short period in which the construction
of this canal was in progress, some of the most
careful labourers&mdash;men who most probably before
then never knew what it was to possess five shillings
at any one time&mdash;saved sufficient money to
enable them to emigrate to Canada.”</p>

<p>There can hardly be a stronger illustration of
the blessing of constant and the curse of casual labour.
We have competence and frugality as the
results of one system; poverty and extravagance
as the results of the other; and among the very
same individuals.</p>

<p>In the evidence given by Mr. Galloway, the
engineer, before a parliamentary committee, he
remarks, that “when employers are competent to
show their men that their business is <i>steady and
certain</i>, and when men find that they are likely
to have <i>permanent</i> employment, they have always
<i>better habits and more settled notions</i>, which will
make them <i>better men</i> and <i>better workmen</i>, and
will produce great benefits to all who are interested
in their employment.”</p>

<p>Moreover, even if payment be assured to a
working man regularly, <i>but deferred for long intervals</i>,
so as to make the returns lose all appearance
of regularity, he will rarely be found able to
resist the temptation of a tavern, and, perhaps, a
long-continued carouse, or of some other extravagance
to his taste, when he receives a month’s
dues at once. I give an instance of this in the
following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>For some years after the peace of 1815 the
staffs of the militias were kept up, but not in any
active service. During the war the militias performed
what are now the functions of the regular
troops in the three kingdoms, their stations being
changed more frequently than those of any of the
regular regiments at the present day. Indeed,
they only differed from the “regulars” in name.
There was the same military discipline, and the
sole difference was, that the militia-men&mdash;who were
balloted for periodically&mdash;could not, by the laws
regulating their embodiment, be sent out of the
United Kingdom for purposes of warfare. The
militias were embodied for twenty-eight days’
training, once in four years (seldom less) after the
peace, and the staff acted as the drill sergeants.
They were usually steady, orderly men, working
at their respective crafts when not on duty after
the militia’s disembodiment, and some who had
not been brought up to any handicraft turned out&mdash;perhaps
from their military habits of early rising
and orderliness&mdash;very good gardeners, both on
their own account and as assistants in gentlemen’s
grounds. No few of them saved money. Yet
these men, with very few exceptions, when they
received a month’s pay, fooled away a part of it in
tippling and idleness, to which they were not at
all addicted when attending regularly to their work
with its regular returns. If they got into any
trouble in consequence of their carousing, it was
looked upon as a sort of legitimate excuse, “Why
you see, sir, it was the 24th” (the 24th of each
month being the pension day).</p>

<p>The thoughtless extravagance of sailors when,
on their return to port, they receive in one sum the
wages they have earned by severe toil amidst
storms and dangers during a long voyage, I need
not speak of; it is a thing well known.</p>

<p>These soldiers and seamen cannot be said to
have been <i>casually</i> employed, but the results were
the same as if they had been so employed; the
money came to them in a lump at so long an interval
as to appear uncertain, and was consequently
squandered.</p>

<p>I may cite the following example as to the
effects of uncertain earnings upon the household
outlay of labourers who suffer from the casualties
of employment induced by the season of the year.
“In the long fine days of summer, the little daughter
of a working brickmaker,” I was told, “used to
order chops and other choice dainties of a butcher,
saying, ‘Please, sir, father don’t care for the price
just a-now; but he must have his chops good;
line-chops, sir, and tender, please&mdash;’cause he’s a
brickmaker.’ In the winter, it was, ‘O please,
sir, here’s a fourpenny bit, and you must send
father something cheap. He don’t care what it is,
so long as it’s cheap. It’s winter, and he hasn’t
no work, sir&mdash;’cause he’s a brickmaker.’”</p>

<p>I have spoken of the tendency of casual labour
to induce intemperate habits. In confirmation of
this I am enabled to give the following account as
to the increase of the sale of malt liquor in the
metropolis <i>consequent upon wet weather</i>. The
account is derived from the personal observations
of a gentleman long familiar with the brewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
trade, in connection with one of the largest
houses. In short, I may state that the account is
given on the very best authority.</p>

<p>There are <i>nine</i> large brewers in London; of
these the two firms transacting the greatest extent
of business supply, daily, 1000 barrels each firm
to their customers; the seven others, among
them, dispose, altogether, of 3000 barrels daily.
All these 5000 barrels a day are solely for town
consumption; and this may be said to be the
<i>average</i> supply the year through, but the public-house
sale is far from regular.</p>

<p>After a wet day the sale of malt liquor, principally
beer (porter), to the metropolitan retailers
is from 500 to 1000 barrels more than when a
wet day has not occurred; that is to say, the
supply increases from 5000 barrels to 5500 and
6000. Such of the publicans as keep small
stocks go the next day to their brewers to order a
further supply; those who have better-furnished
cellars may not go for two or three days after, but
the result is the same.</p>

<p>The reason for this increased consumption is
obvious; when the weather prevents workmen
from prosecuting their respective callings in
the open air, they have recourse to drinking, to
pass away the idle time. Any one who has made
himself familiar with the habits of the working
classes has often found them crowding a public-house
during a hard rain, especially in the neighbourhood
of new buildings, or any public open-air
work. The street-sellers, themselves prevented
from plying their trades outside, are busy in such
times in the “publics,” offering for sale braces,
belts, hose, tobacco-boxes, nuts of different kinds,
apples, &amp;c. A bargain may then be struck for
so much and a half-pint of beer, and so the consumption
is augmented by the trade in other
matters.</p>

<p>Now, taking 750 barrels as the average of
the extra sale of beer in consequence of wet
weather, we have a consumption beyond the demands
of the ordinary trade in malt liquor of
27,000 gallons, or 216,000 pints. This, at 2<i>d.</i> a
pint, is 3000<i>l.</i> for a day’s needless, and often prejudicial,
outlay caused by the casualty of the
weather and the consequent casualty of labour.
A censor of morals might say that these men
should go home under such circumstances; but
their homes may be at a distance, and may present
no great attractions; the single men among them
may have no homes, merely sleeping-places; and
even the more prudent may think it advisable to
wait awhile under shelter in hopes of the weather
improving, so that they could resume their labour,
and only an hour or so be deducted from their
wages. Besides, there is the attraction to the
labourer of the warmth, discussion, freedom, and
excitement of the public-house.</p>

<p>That the great bulk of the consumers of this
<i>additional</i> beer are of the classes I have mentioned
is, I think, plain enough, from the increase
being experienced only in that beverage, the consumption
of gin being little affected by the same
means. Indeed, the statistics showing the ratio
of beer and gin-drinking are curious enough
(were this the place to enter into them), the most
gin, as a general rule, being consumed in the most
depressed years.</p>

<p>“It is a fact worth notice,” said a statistical
journal, entitled “Facts and Figures,” published
in 1841, “as illustrative of the <i>tendency of the
times of pressure to increase spirit drinking</i>, that
whilst under the privations of last year (1840)
the poorer classes paid 2,628,286<i>l.</i> tax for spirits;
in 1836, a year of the greatest prosperity, the tax
on British spirits amounted only to 2,390,188<i>l.</i>
<i>So true is it that to impoverish is to demoralise.</i>”</p>

<p>The numbers who imbibe, in the course of a
wet day, these 750 barrels, cannot, of course, be
ascertained, but the following calculations may be
presented. The class of men I have described
rarely have spare money, but if known to a landlord,
they probably may obtain credit until the
Saturday night. Now, putting their <i>extra</i> beer-drinking
on wet days&mdash;for on fine days there is
generally a pint or more consumed daily per
working man&mdash;putting, I say, the <i>extra</i> potations
at a pot (quart) each man, we find <i>one hundred
and eight thousand</i> consumers (out of 2,000,000
people, or, discarding the women and children, not
1,000,000)! A number doubling, and trebling,
and quadrupling the male adult population of
many a splendid continental city.</p>

<p>Of the data I have given, I may repeat, no
doubt can be entertained; nor, as it seems to me,
can any doubt be entertained that the increased
consumption is directly attributable to the
casualty of labour<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Scurf Trade among the Rubbish-Carters.</span></h3>

<p>Before proceeding to treat of the cheap or
“scurf” labourers among the rubbish-carters, I
shall do as I have done in connection with the
casual labourers of the same trade, say a few
words on that kind of labour in general, both as
to the means by which it is usually obtained and
as to the distinctive qualities of the scurf or low-priced
labourers; for experience teaches me that
the mode by which labour is cheapened is more or
less similar in all trades, and it will therefore save
much time and space if I here&mdash;as with the casual
labourers&mdash;give the general facts in connection
with this part of my subject.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, there are but two direct
modes of cheapening labour, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. By making the workmen do <i>more</i> work for
the <i>same</i> pay.</p>

<p>2. By making them do the <i>same</i> work for <i>less</i> pay.</p>

<p>The first of these modes is what is technically
termed “<i>driving</i>,” especially when effected by compulsory
“overwork;” and it is called the “economy
of labour” when brought about by more elaborate
and refined processes, such as the division of labour,
the large system of production, the invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of machinery, and the <i>temporary</i>, as contradistinguished
from the <i>permanent</i>, mode of hiring.</p>

<p>Each of these modes of making workmen do
<i>more</i> work for the <i>same</i> pay, can but have the
same depressing effect on the labour market, for
not only is the <i>rate</i> of remuneration (or ratio of
the work to the pay) reduced when the operative
is made to do a greater quantity of work for the
same amount of money, but, unless the means of
disposing of the extra products be proportionately
increased, it is evident that just as many workmen
must be displaced thereby as the increased
term or rate of working exceeds the extension of
the markets; that is to say, if 4000 workpeople
be made to produce each twice as much as formerly
(either by extending the hours of labour or increasing
their rate of labouring), then if the
markets or means of disposing of the extra products
be increased only one-half, 1000 hands must,
according to Cocker, be deprived of their ordinary
employment; and these competing with those who
are in work will immediately tend to reduce the
wages of the trade generally, so that not only
will the <i>rate</i> of wages be decreased, since each will
have more work to do, but the actual earnings of
the workmen will be diminished likewise.</p>

<p>Of the economy of labour itself, as a means of
cheapening work, there is no necessity for me to
speak here. It is, indeed, generally admitted,
that to economize labour without proportionally
extending the markets for the products of such
labour, is to deprive a certain number of workmen
of their ordinary means of living; and under the
head of casual labour so many instances have
been given of this principle that it would be
wearisome to the reader were I to do other than
allude to the matter at present. There are, however,
several other means of causing a workman to do
more than his ordinary quantity of work. These
<span class="lock">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. By extra supervision when the workmen
are paid by the day. Of this mode of
increased production an instance has already
been cited in the account of the
strapping-shops given at p. <a href="#Page_304">304</a>, vol. ii.</p>

<p>2. By increasing the workman’s interest in
his work; as in piece-work, where the
payment of the operative is made proportional
to the quantity of work done by
him. Of this mode examples have already
been given at p. <a href="#Page_303">303</a>, vol. ii.</p>

<p>3. By large quantities of work given out at
one time; as in “lump-work” and “contract
work.”</p>

<p>4. By the domestic system of work, or giving
out materials to be made up at the
homes of the workpeople.</p>

<p>5. By the middleman system of labour.</p>

<p>6. By the prevalence of small masters.</p>

<p>7. By a reduced rate of pay, as forcing
operatives to labour both longer and
quicker, in order to make up the same
amount of income.</p></div>

<p>Of several of these modes of work I have
already spoken, citing facts as to their pernicious
influence upon the greater portion of those trades
where they are found to prevail. I have already
shown how, by extra supervision&mdash;by increased
interest in the work&mdash;as well as by decreased pay,
operatives can be made to do more work than they
otherwise would, and so be the cause, unless the
market be proportionately extended, of depriving
some of their fellow-labourers of their fair share
of employment. It now only remains for me to
set forth the effect of those modes of employment
which have not yet been described, viz., the
domestic system, the middleman system, and the
contract and lump system, as well as the small-master
system of work.</p>

<p>Let me begin with the first of the last-mentioned
modes of cheapening labour, viz., <i>the domestic
system of work</i>.</p>

<p>I find, by investigation, that in trades where
the system of working on the master’s premises
has been departed from, and a man is allowed to
take his work home, there is invariably a tendency
to cheapen labour. These home workers,
whenever opportunity offers, will use other men’s
ill-paid labour, or else employ the members of
their family to enhance their own profits.</p>

<p>The domestic system, moreover, naturally induces
<i>over-work and Sunday-work, as well as tends to
change journeymen into trading operatives, living
on the labour of their fellow-workmen</i>. When the
work is executed off the master’s premises, of
course there are neither definite hours nor days for
labour; and the consequence is, the generality of
home workers labour early and late, Sundays as
well as week-days, availing themselves at the
same time of the co-operation of their wives and
children; thus the trade becomes overstocked
with workpeople by the introduction of a vast
number of new hands into it, as well as by the
overwork of the men themselves who thus obtain
employment. When I was among the tailors, I
received from a journeyman to whom I was referred
by the Trades’ Society as the one best able
to explain the causes of the decline of that trade,
the following lucid account of the evils of this
system of <span class="lock">labour:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The principal cause of the decline of our
trade is the employment given to workmen at
their own homes, or, in other words, to the
‘sweaters.’ The sweater is the greatest evil in
the trade; as the sweating system increases the
number of hands to an almost incredible extent&mdash;wives,
sons, daughters, and extra women, all
working ‘long days’&mdash;that is, labouring from
sixteen to eighteen hours per day, and Sundays
as well. By this system two men obtain as much
work as would give employment to three or four
men working regular hours in the shop. Consequently,
the sweater being enabled to get the
work done by women and children at a lower
price than the regular workman, obtains the
greater part of the garments to be made, while
men who depend upon the shop for their living
are obliged to walk about idle. A greater quantity
of work is done under the sweating system
at a lower price. I consider that the decline of
my trade dates from the change of day-work into
piece-work. According to the old system, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
journeyman was paid by the day, and consequently
must have done his work under the eye
of his employer. It is true that work was given
out by the master before the change from day-work
to piece-work was regularly acknowledged
in the trade. But still it was morally impossible
for work to be given out and not be paid by the
piece. <i>Hence I date the decrease in the wages of
the workman from the introduction of piece-work,
and giving out garments to be made off the premises
of the master.</i> The effect of this was, that
the workman making the garment, knowing that
the master could not tell whom he got to do his
work for him, employed women and children to
help him, and paid them little or nothing for
their labour. This was the beginning of the
sweating system. The workmen gradually became
transformed from journeymen into ‘middlemen,’
living by the labour of others. Employers
soon began to find that they could get garments
made at a less sum than the regular price, and
those tradesmen who were anxious to force their
trade, by underselling their more honourable
neighbours, readily availed themselves of this
means of obtaining cheap labour.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>middleman system of work</i> is so much akin
to the domestic system, of which, indeed, it is
but a necessary result, that it forms a natural
addendum to the above. Of this indirect mode of
employing workmen, I said, in the <i>Chronicle</i>,
when treating of the timber-porters at the <span class="lock">docks:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The middleman system is the one crying evil
of the day. Whether he goes by the name of
‘sweater,’ ‘chamber-master,’ ‘lumper,’ or contractor,
it is this <i>trading operative</i> who is the great means
of reducing the wages of his fellow working-men.
To make a profit out of the employment of his
brother operatives he must, of course, obtain a
lower class and, consequently, cheaper labour.
Hence it becomes a <i>business</i> with him to hunt out
the lowest grades of working men&mdash;that is to say,
those who are either morally or intellectually inferior
in the craft&mdash;the drunken, the dishonest,
the idle, the vagabond, and the unskilful; these
are the instruments that he seeks for, because, these
being unable to obtain employment at the regular
wages of the sober, honest, industrious, and skilful
portion of the trade, he can obtain their labour at
a lower rate than what is usually paid. Hence
drunkards, tramps, men without character or station,
apprentices, children&mdash;all suit him. Indeed,
the more degraded the labourers, the better they
answer his purpose, for the cheaper he can get
their work, and consequently the more he can
make out of it.</p>

<p>“‘Boy labour or thief labour,’ said a middleman,
on a large scale, to me, ‘what do I care, so
long as I can get my work done cheap?’ That this
<i>seeking out</i> of cheap and inferior labour really
takes place, and is a necessary consequence of the
middleman system, we have merely to look into
the condition of any trade where it is extensively
pursued. I have shown, in my account of the tailors’
trade printed in the <i>Chronicle</i>, that the wives of
the sweaters not only parade the streets of London
on the look-out for youths raw from the country,
but that they make periodical trips to the poorest
provinces of Ireland, in order to obtain workmen
at the lowest possible rate. I have shown, moreover,
that foreigners are annually imported from
the Continent for the same purpose, and that among
the chamber-masters in the shoe trade, the child-market
at Bethnal-green, as well as the workhouses,
are continually ransacked for the means of
obtaining a cheaper kind of labour. All my investigations
go to prove, that it is chiefly by
means of this middleman system that the wages
of the working men are reduced. It is this
contractor&mdash;this trading operative&mdash;who is invariably
the prime mover in the reduction of
the wages of his fellow-workmen. He uses the
most degraded of the class as a means of underselling
the worthy and skilful labourers, and of
ultimately dragging the better down to the abasement
of the worst. He cares not whether the
trade to which he belongs is already overstocked
with hands, for, be those hands as many as they
may, and the ordinary wages of his craft down to
bare subsistence point, it matters not a jot to him;
<i>he</i> can live solely by reducing them still lower,
and so he immediately sets about drafting or importing
a fresh and cheaper stock into the trade.
If <i>men</i> cannot subsist on lower prices, then he
takes apprentices, or hires children; if women of
chastity cannot afford to labour at the price he
gives, then he has recourse to prostitutes; or if
workmen of character and worth refuse to work at
less than the ordinary rate, then he seeks out the
moral refuse of the trade&mdash;those whom none else
will employ; or else he flies, to find labour meet
for his purpose, to the workhouse and the gaol.
Backed by this cheap and refuse labour, he offers
his work at lower prices, and so keeps on reducing
and reducing the wages of his brethren, until all
sink in poverty, wretchedness, and vice. Go
where we will, look into whatever poorly-paid
craft we please, we shall find this <i>trading operative</i>,
this <i>middleman</i> or contractor, at the bottom
of the degradation.”</p>

<p>The “contract system” or “lump work,” as it
is called, is but a corollary, as it were, of the
foregoing; for it is an essential part of the middleman
system, that the work should be obtained by
the trading operative in large quantities, so that
those upon whose labour he lives should be kept
continually occupied, and the more, of course, that
he can obtain work for, the greater his profit. When
a quantity of work, usually paid for by the piece,
is given out at one time, the natural tendency is
for the piece-work to pass into lump-work; that is
to say, if there be in a trade a number of distinct
parts, each requiring, perhaps, from the division
of labour, a distinct hand for the execution of it,
or if each of these parts bear a different price, it
is frequently the case that the master will contract
with some one workman for the execution of the
whole, agreeing to give a certain price for the job
“in the lump,” and allowing the workman to get
whom he pleases to execute it. This is the case
with the piece-working masters in the coach-building
trade; but it is not essential to the contract or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
lump system of work, that other hands should be
employed; the main distinction between it and
piece-work being that the work is given out in
large quantities, and a certain allowance or reduction
of price effected from that cause alone.</p>

<p>It is this contract or lump work which constitutes
the great evil of the carpenter’s, as well
as of many other trades; and as in those crafts,
so in this, we find that the lower the wages are
reduced the greater becomes the number of trading
operatives or middlemen. For it is when workmen
find the difficulty of living by their labour
increased that they take to scheming and trading
upon the labour of their fellows. In the slop
trade, where the pay is the worst, these creatures
abound the most; and so in the carpenter’s trade,
where the wages are the lowest&mdash;as among the
speculative builders&mdash;there the system of contracting
and sub-contracting is found in full force.</p>

<p>Of this contract or lump work, I received the
following account from the foreman to a large
speculating builder, when I was inquiring into
the condition of the London <span class="lock">carpenters:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The way in which the work is done is mostly
by letting and subletting. The masters usually
prefer to let work, because it takes all the trouble
off their hands. They know what they are to
get for the job, and of course they let it as much
under that figure as they possibly can, all of
which is clear gain without the least trouble.
How the work is done, or by whom, it’s no
matter to them, so long as they can make what
they want out of the job, and have no bother
about it. Some of our largest builders are taking
to this plan, and a party who used to have one of
the largest shops in London has within the last
three years discharged all the men in his employ
(he had 200 at least), and has now merely an
office, and none but clerks and accountants in his
pay. He has taken to letting his work out
instead of doing it at home. The parties to whom
the work is let by the speculating builders are
generally working men, and these men in their
turn look out for other working men, who will
take the job cheaper than they will; and so I leave
you, sir, and the public to judge what the party
who really executes the work gets for his labour,
and what is the quality of work that he is likely
to put into it. The speculating builder generally
employs an overlooker to see that the work
is done sufficiently well to pass the surveyor.
That’s all he cares about. Whether it’s done by
thieves, or drunkards, or boys, it’s no matter to
him. The overlooker, of course, sees after the
first party to whom the work is let, and this
party in his turn looks after the several hands
that he has sublet it to. The first man who
agrees to the job takes it in the lump, and he
again lets it to others in the piece. I have
known instances of its having been let again a
third time, but this is not usual. The party who
takes the job in the lump from the speculator
usually employs a foreman, whose duty it is to
give out the materials and to make working
drawings. The men to whom it is sublet only
find labour, while the ‘lumper,’ or first contractor,
agrees for both labour and materials. It
is usual in contract work, for the first party who
takes the job to be bound in a large sum for the
due and faithful performance of his contract. He
then, in his turn, finds out a sub-contractor, who is
mostly a small builder, who will also bind himself
that the work shall be properly executed, and
there the binding ceases&mdash;those parties to whom
the job is afterwards let, or sublet, employing
foremen or overlookers to see that their contract is
carried out. The first contractor has scarcely any
trouble whatsoever; he merely engages a gentleman,
who rides about in a gig, to see that what is
done is likely to pass muster. The sub-contractor
has a little more trouble; and so it goes on as it
gets down and down. Of course I need not tell
you that the first contractor, who does the <i>least</i> of
all, gets the <i>most</i> of all; while the poor wretch of
a working man, who positively executes the job,
is obliged to slave away every hour, night after
night, to get a bare living out of it; and this is
the contract system.”</p>

<p>A tradesman, or a speculator, will contract, for
a certain sum, to complete the skeleton of a house,
and render it fit for habitation. He will sublet
the flooring to some working joiner, who will, in
very many cases, take it on such terms as to
allow himself, by working early and late, the regular
journeymen’s wages of 30<i>s.</i> a week, or perhaps
rather more. Now this sub-contractor cannot
complete the work within the requisite time by
his own unaided industry, and he employs men to
assist him, often subletting again, and such
assistant men will earn perhaps but 4<i>s.</i> a day.
It is the same with the doors, the staircases, the
balustrades, the window-frames, the room-skirtings,
the closets; in short, all parts of the building.</p>

<p>The subletting is accomplished without difficulty.
Old men are sometimes employed in such
work, and will be glad of any remuneration to
escape the workhouse; while stronger workmen are
usually sanguine that by extra exertion, “though
the figure is low, they may make a tidy thing out
of it after all.” In this way labour is cheapened.
“Lump” work, “piece” work, work by “the job,”
are all portions of the contract system. The principle
is the same. “Here is this work to be done,
what will you undertake to do it for?”</p>

<p>In number after number of the <i>Builder</i> will be
found statements headed “Blind Builders.” One
firm, responding to an advertisement for “estimates”
of the building of a church, sends in an
offer to execute the work in the best style for
5000<i>l.</i> Another firm may offer to do it for somewhere
about 3000<i>l.</i> The first-mentioned firm
would do the work well, paying the “honourable”
rate of wages. The under-working firm <i>must</i> resort
to the scamping and subletting system I have
alluded to. It appears that the building of
churches and chapels, of all denominations, is one
of the greatest encouragement to slop, or scamp, or
under-paid work. The same system prevails in
many trades with equally pernicious effects.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“If you will allow me,” says a correspondent,
“I would state that there is one cause of hardship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and suffering to the labouring or handicraftsman,
which, to my mind, is far more productive of
distress and poor-grinding than any other, or than
all other causes put together: I allude to the <i>contract</i>
system, and especially in reference to printing.
Depend upon it, sir, the father of wickedness
himself could not devise a more malevolent
or dishonest course than that now very generally
pursued by those who should be, of all others,
the friends of the poor and working man. The
Government and the great West-end clubs have
reduced their transactions to such a low level in
this respect that it seems to be the only question
with them, Who will work lowest or supply goods
at the lowest figure? And this, too, totally irrespective
of the circumstance whether it may not
reduce wages or bankrupt the contractor. No
matter whether a party who has executed the
work required for years be noted for paying a
fair and remunerating price to his workmen or
sub-tradesmen, and bears the character of a responsible
and trustworthy man&mdash;all this is as
nothing; for somebody, who may be, for aught
that is cared, deficient in all these points, will do
what is needful at <i>so much</i> less; and then,
unless willing to reduce the wage of his workpeople,
the long-employed tradesman has but the
alternative of losing his business or cheating his
creditors. And then, to give a smack to the
whole affair, the ‘Stationery Office’ of the Government,
or the committee of the club, will
congratulate themselves and their auditors on
the fact that a diminution in expenses has been
effected; a result commemorated perhaps by an
addition of salary to the officials in the former
case, and of a ‘cordial vote of thanks’ in the
latter. I do not write ‘without book,’ I can
assure you, on these matters; for I have long and
earnestly watched the subject, and could fill many
a page with the details.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the ruinous effects of the contract system in
connection with the army clothing, Mr. Pearse, the
army clothier, gave the following evidence before the
Select Committee on Army and Navy Appointments.</p>

<p>“When the contract for soldier’s great coats was
opened, Mr. Maberly took it at the same price (13<i>s.</i>)
in December, 1808; this shows the effect of wild
competition. In February following, Esdailes’
house, who were accoutrement makers, and not
clothiers, got knowledge of what was Mr. Maberly’s
price, and <i>they</i> tendered at 12<i>s.</i> 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> a month
afterwards; it was evidently then a struggle for
the price, and how the quality the least good (if
we may use such a term) could pass. Mr. Maberly
did not like to be outbidden by Esdailes; <i>Esdailes
stopped subsequently</i>, and Mr. Maberly bid 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
three months after, and Mr. Dixon bid again,
and got the contract for 11<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> in October, and
in December of that year another public tender
took place, and Messrs. A. and D. Cock took it at
11<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>, <i>and they subsequently broke</i>. It went
on in this sort of way,&mdash;changing hands every
two or every three months, by bidding against each
other. Presently, though it was calculated that
the great coat was to wear four years, it was found
that <i>those great coats were so inferior in quality,
that they wore only two years</i>, and representations
were accordingly made to the Commander-in-Chief,
when it was found necessary that great care should
be taken to go back to the original good quality
that had been established by the Duke of York.”</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw, another army clothier, and a gentleman
with whose friendship, I am proud to say, I
have been honoured since the commencement of
my inquiries&mdash;a gentleman actuated by the most
kindly and Christian impulses, and of whom the
workpeople speak in terms of the highest admiration
and regard; this gentleman, impressed with a
deep sense of the evils of the contract system to
the under-paid and over-worked operatives of his
trade, addressed a letter to the Chairman of the
Committee on Army, Navy, and Ordnance Estimates,
from which the following are <span class="lock">extracts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My Lord, my object more particularly is, to
request your lordship will submit to the committee,
<i>as an evidence of the evils of contracts</i>, the great
coat sent herewith, made similar to those supplied
to the army, and I would respectfully appeal to
them as men, gentlemen, <i>as Christians</i>, whether
<i>fivepence</i>, the price now being given to poor females
for making up those coats, is a fair and just price
for six, seven, and eight hours’ work....
My Lord, <i>the misery amongst the workpeople is
most distressing</i>&mdash;of a mass of people, <i>willing to
work</i>, who cannot obtain it, and of a mass, especially
women, most iniquitously paid for their
labour, who are in a state of oppression disgraceful
to the Legislature, the Government, the Church,
and the consuming public.... I would,
therefore, most humbly and earnestly call upon
your lordship, and the other members of the committee,
to recommend an <i>immediate stop to be put
to the system of contracting</i> now pursued by the
different government departments, as being one of
false economy, as a system most <i>oppressive to the
poor</i>, and <i>being most injurious</i>, in every way, to
the best <i>interests of the country</i>.”</p>

<p>In another place the same excellent gentleman
<span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I could refer to the screwing down of other
things by the government authorities, but the
above will be sufficient to show <i>how cruelly the
workpeople employed in making up this clothing
are oppressed; and some of the men will tell you
they are tired of life. Last week I found one man
making a country police coat, who said his wife
and child were out begging</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last mentioned of the several modes of
cheapening labour is the “<i>small-master system</i>”
of work, that is to say, the operatives taking
to make up materials on their own account rather
than for capitalist employers. In every trade
where there are <i>small</i> masters, trades into which it
requires but little capital to embark, there is certain
to be a cheapening of labour. Such a man
works himself, and to get work, to meet the exigences
of the rent and the demands of the collectors
of the parliamentary and parochial taxes, he
will often underwork the very journeymen whom
he occasionally employs, doing “the job” in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
cases with the assistance of his family and apprentices,
at a less rate of profit than the amount of
journeymen’s wages.</p>

<p>Concerning these garret masters I said, when
treating of the Cabinet trade, in the <i>Chronicle</i>,
“The cause of the extraordinary decline of wages
in the Cabinet trade (even though the hands decreased
and the work increased to an unprecedented
extent) will be found to consist in the increase
that has taken place within the last 20 years
of what are called ‘garret masters’ in the cabinet
trade. These garret masters are a class of small
‘trade-working masters,’ the same as the ‘chamber
masters’ in the shoe trade, supplying both capital
and labour. They are in manufacture what ‘the
peasant proprietors’ are in agriculture&mdash;their own
employers and their own workmen. There is,
however, this one marked distinction between the
two classes&mdash;the garret master cannot, like the
peasant proprietor, <i>eat</i> what he produces; the consequence
is, that he is obliged to convert each article
into food immediately he manufactures it&mdash;no
matter what the state of the market may be. The
capital of the garret master being generally sufficient
to find him in materials for the manufacture of
only one article at a time, and his savings being
but barely enough for his subsistence while he is
engaged in putting those materials together, he is
compelled, the moment the work is completed, to
part with it for whatever he can get. He cannot
afford to keep it even a day, for to do so is generally
to remain a day unfed. Hence, if the market
be at all slack, he has to force a sale by offering
his goods at the lowest possible price. What
wonder, then, that the necessities of such a class
of individuals should have created a special race
of employers, known by the significant name of
‘slaughter-house men’&mdash;or that these, being aware
of the inability of the ‘garret masters’ to hold out
against any offer, no matter how slight a remuneration
it affords for their labour, should continually
lower and lower their prices, until the entire body
of the competitive portion of the cabinet trade is
sunk in utter destitution and misery? Moreover,
it is well known how strong is the stimulus among
peasant proprietors, or, indeed, any class working
for themselves, to extra production. So it is, indeed,
with the garret masters; their industry is
almost incessant, and hence a greater quantity of
work is turned out by them, and continually forced
into the market, than there would otherwise be.
What though there be a brisk and a slack season
in the cabinet-maker’s trade as in the majority of
others?&mdash;slack or brisk, the garret masters must
produce the same excessive quantity of goods. In
the hope of extricating himself from his overwhelming
poverty, he toils on, producing more and
more&mdash;and yet the more he produces the more
hopeless does his position become; for the greater
the stock that he thrusts into the market, the
lower does the price of his labour fall, until at last,
he and his whole family work for less than half
what he himself could earn a few years back by
his own unaided labour.”</p>

<p>The small-master system of work leads, like the
domestic system, with which, indeed, it is intimately
connected, to the employment of wives,
children, and apprentices, as a means of assistance
and extra production&mdash;for as the prices decline so
do the small masters strive by further labour to
compensate for their loss of income.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, then, are the several modes of work by
which labour is cheapened. There are, as we
have seen, but two ways of <i>directly</i> effecting this,
viz., first by making men do more work for the
same pay, and secondly, by making them do the
same work for less pay. The way in which men
are made to do more, it has been pointed out, is, by
causing them either to work longer or quicker, or
else by employing fewer hands in proportion to the
work; or engaging them only for such time as
their services are required, and discharging them
immediately afterwards. These constitute the
several modes of economizing labour, which lowers
the rate of remuneration (the ratio of the pay to
the work) rather than the pay itself. The several
means by which this result is attained are termed
“systems of work, production, or engagement,”
and such are those above detailed.</p>

<p>Now it is a necessity of these several systems,
though the actual amount of remuneration is not
directly reduced by them, that a cheaper labour
should be obtained for carrying them out. Thus,
in contract or lump work, perhaps, the price may
not be immediately lowered; the saving to the
employer consisting chiefly in supervision, he
having in such a case only one man to look to
instead of perhaps a hundred. The contractor,
or lumper, however, is differently situated; he, in
order to reap any benefit from the contract, must,
since he cannot do the whole work himself, employ
others to help him, and to reap any benefit from
the contract, this of course must be done at a lower
price than he himself receives; so it is with the
middleman system, where a profit is derived from
the labour of other operatives; so, again, with the
domestic system of work, where the several members
of the family, or cheaper labourers, are generally
employed as assistants; and even so is it
with the small-master system, where the labour of
apprentices and wives and children is the principal
means of help. Hence the operatives adopting
these several systems of work are rather the instruments
by which cheap labour is obtained than
the cheap labourers themselves. It is true that a
sweater, a chamber master, or garret master, a
lumper or contractor, or a home worker, generally
works cheaper than the ordinary operatives, but
this he does chiefly by the cheap labourers he employs,
and then, finding that he is able to underwork
the rest of the trade, and that the more
hands he employs the greater becomes his profit,
he offers to do work at less than the usual rate.
It is not a necessity of the system that the middleman
operative, the domestic worker, the lumper,
or garret master should be himself underpaid, but
simply that he should employ others who are so,
and it is thus that such systems of work tend to
cheapen the labour of those trades in which they
are found to prevail. Who, then, are the cheap
labourers?&mdash;who the individuals, by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
whose services the sweater, the smaller master,
the lumper, and others, is enabled to underwork
the rest of his trade?&mdash;what the general characteristics
of those who, in the majority of handicrafts,
are found ready to do the same work for less pay,
and how are these usually distinguished from such
as obtain the higher rate of remuneration?</p>

<p><i>The cheap workmen</i> in all trades, I find, are
divisible into three <span class="lock">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. The unskilful.</li>
<li>2. The untrustworthy.</li>
<li>3. The inexpensive.</li>
</ul>


<p>First, as regards the <i>unskilful</i>. Long ago it has
been noticed how frequently boys were put to
trades to which their tastes and temperaments were
antagonistic. Gay, who in his quiet, unpretending
style often elicited a truth, tells how a century and
a half ago the generality of parents never considered
for what business a boy was best <span class="lock">adapted&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“But ev’n in infancy decree</div>
      <div class="verse">What this or t’ other son shall be.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A boy thus brought up to a craft for which he
entertains a dislike can hardly become a proficient
in it. At the present time thousands of parents
are glad to have their sons reared to <i>any</i> business
which their means or opportunities place within
their reach, even though the lad be altogether unsuited
to the craft. The consequence is, that these
boys often grow up to be unskilful workmen.
There are technical terms for them in different
trades, but perhaps the generic appellation is
“muffs.” Such workmen, however well conducted,
can rarely obtain employment in a good shop at
good wages, and are compelled, therefore, to accept
second, third, and fourth-rate wages, and are often
driven to slop work.</p>

<p>Other causes may be cited as tending to form
unskilful workmen: the neglect of masters or foremen,
or their incapacity to teach apprentices; irregular
habits in the learner; and insufficient practice
during a master’s paucity of employment. I
am assured, moreover, that hundreds of mechanics
yearly come to London <i>from the country parts</i>,
whose skill is altogether inadequate to the demands
of the “honourable trade.” Of course, during
the finishing of their education they can only work
for inferior shops at inferior wages; hence another
cause of cheap labour. Of this I will cite an instance:
a bootmaker, who for years had worked
for first-rate West-end shops, told me that when
he came to London from a country town he was
sanguine of success, because he knew that he was
a <i>ready</i> man (a quick workman.) He very soon
found out, however, he said, that as he aspired to
do the best work, he “had his business to learn
all over again;” and until he attained the requisite
skill, he worked for “just what he could get:” he
was a cheap, because then an unskilful, labourer.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, the cheaper labour of <i>apprentices</i>,
the great prop of many a slop-trader;
for as such traders disregard all the niceties of
work, as they disregard also the solidity and perfect
finish of any work (finishing it, as it was once
described to me, “just to the eye”), a lad is soon
made useful, and his labour remunerative to his
master, as far as slop remuneration goes, which,
though small in a small business, is wealth in a
“monster business.”</p>

<p>There are, again, the “<i>improvers</i>.” These are
the most frequent in the dress-making and millinery
business, as young women find it impossible
to form a good connection among a wealthier class
of ladies in any country town, unless the “patronesses”
are satisfied that their skill and taste have
been perfected in London. In my inquiry (in the
course of two letters in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>)
into the condition of the workwomen in this calling,
I was told by a retired dressmaker, who had
for upwards of twenty years carried on business
in the neighbourhood of Grosvenor-square, that
she had sometimes met with “improvers” so tasteful
and quick, from a good provincial tuition, that
they had really little or nothing to learn in London.
And yet their services were secured for one,
and oftener for two years, merely for board and
lodging, while others employed in the same establishment
had not only board and lodging, but
handsome salaries. The improver’s, then, is generally
a cheap labour, and often a very cheap labour
too. The same form of cheap labour prevails in the
carpenter’s trade.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, the labour of <i>old men</i>. A
tailor, for instance, who may have executed the
most skilled work of his craft, in his old age, or
before the period of old age, finds his eyesight fail
him,&mdash;finds his tremulous fingers have not a full
and rapid mastery of the needle, and he then labours,
at greatly reduced rates of payment, on the
making of soldiers’ clothing&mdash;“sanc-work,”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> as it
is called&mdash;or on any ill-paid and therefore ill-wrought
labour.</p>

<p>The inferior, as regards the quality of the work,
and under-paid class of <i>women</i>, in tailoring, for
example, again, cheapen labour. It is cheapened,
also, by the employment of <i>Irishmen</i> (in, perhaps,
all branches of skilled or unskilled labour), and of
<i>foreigners</i>, more especially of Poles, who are inferior
workmen to the English, and who will work
<i>very</i> cheap, thus supplying a low-price labour to
those who seek it.</p>

<p>I may remark further, that if a first-rate workman
be driven to slop work, he soon loses his skill;
he can only work slop; this has been shown over
and over again, and so <i>his</i> labour becomes cheap
in the mart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. Of <i>Untrustworthy Labour</i> (as a cause of
cheap labour) I need not say much. It is obvious
that a drunken, idle, or dishonest workman
or workwoman, when pressed by want, will and
must labour, not for the recompense the labour
merits, but for whatever pittance an employer will
accord. There is no reliance to be placed in him.
Such a man cannot “hold out” for terms, for he is
perhaps starving, and it is known that “he cannot
be depended upon.” In the sweep’s trade many
of those who work at a lower rate than the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the trade are men who have lost their regular
work by dishonesty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>3. The <i>Inexpensive class</i> of workpeople are very
numerous. They consist of three sub-<span class="lock">divisions:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Those who have been accustomed to a
coarser kind of diet, and who, consequently,
requiring less, can afford to work for less.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Those who derive their subsistence from
other sources, and who, consequently, do
not live by their labour.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Those who are in receipt of certain “aids
to their wages,” or who have other means
of living beside their work.</p></div>

<p>Of course these causes can alone have influence
where the wages are <i>minimized</i> or reduced to the
lowest ebb of subsistence, in which case they become
so many means of driving down the price of
labour still lower.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Those who, being what is designated hard-reared
that is to say, accustomed to a scantier or
coarser diet, and who, therefore, “can do” with a
less quantity or less expensive quality of food than
the average run of labourers, can of course live at a
lower cost, and so <i>afford</i> to work at a lower rate.
Among such (unskilled) labourers are the peasants
from many of the counties, who seek to
amend their condition by obtaining employment
in the towns. I will instance the agricultural
labourers of Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>“Bread and potatoes,” writes Mr. Thornton,
in his work on Over-Population and its Remedy,
p. 21, “do really form the staple of their food.
As for meat, most of them would not know its
taste, if, once or twice <i>in the course of their lives</i>,&mdash;on
the squire’s having a son and heir born to
him, or on the young gentleman’s coming of age,&mdash;they
were not regaled with a dinner of what the
newspapers call ‘old English fare.’ Some of them
contrive to have a little bacon, in the proportion,
it seems, of <i>half a pound a week to a dozen persons</i>,
but they more commonly use fat to give
the potatoes a relish; and, as one of them said to
Mr. Austin (a commissioner), ‘they don’t <i>always</i>
go without cheese.’”</p>

<p>With many poor Irishmen the rearing has been
still harder. I had some conversation with an
Irish rubbish-carter, who had been thrown out of
work (and was entitled to no allowance from any
trade society) in consequence of a strike by Mr.
Myers’s men. On my asking him how he subsisted
in Ireland, “Will, thin, sir,” he said, “and
it’s God’s truth, I once lived for days on green
things I picked up by the road side, and the
turnips, and that sort of mate I stole from the
fields. It was called staling, but it was the
hunger, ’deed was it. That was in the county
Limerick, sir, in the famine and ’viction times;
and, glory be to God, I ’scaped when others
didn’t.”</p>

<p>I may observe that the chief local paper, the
<i>Limerick and Clare Examiner</i>, published twice
a week, gave, twice a week, at the period of
“the famine and evictions,” statements similar to
that of my informant.</p>

<p>Now, would not a poor man, reared as the
Limerick peasant I have spoken of, who was
actually driven to eat the grass, which biblical
history shows was once a signal punishment to a
great offender&mdash;would not such a man work for
the veriest dole, rather than again be subjected
to the pangs of hunger? In my inquiries among
the costermongers, one of them said of the Irish
in his trade, and without any bitterness, “they’ll
work for nothing, and live on less.” The meaning
is obvious enough, although the assertion is, of
course, a contradiction in itself.</p>

<p>“This department of labour,” says Mr. Baines, in
his History of the Hand-Loom Weavers, is “greatly
overstocked, and the price necessarily falls. The
evil is aggravated by the multitudes of Irish who
have flocked into Lancashire, some of whom, having
been linen weavers, naturally resort to the loom,
and others learn to weave as the easiest employment
they can adopt. Accustomed to a wretched
mode of living in their own country, they are contented
with wages that would starve an English
labourer. They have, in fact, so lowered the <i>rate</i>
of wages as to drive many of the English out of
the employment, and to drag down those who
remain in it to their own level.”</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Those who derive their subsistence from
other sources can, of course, afford to work cheaper
than those who have to live by their labour. To
this class belongs the labour of wives and children,
who, being supposed to be maintained by
the toil of the husband, are never paid “living
wages” for what they do; and hence the misery
of the great mass of needlewomen, widows, unmarried
and friendless females, and the like,
who, having none to assist them, are forced to
starve upon the pittance they receive for their
work. The labour of those who are in prisons,
workhouses, and asylums, and who consequently
have their subsistence found them in such places,
as well as the work of prostitutes, who obtain
their living by other means than work, all come
under the category of those who can afford to
labour at a lower rate than such as are condemned
to toil for an honest living. It is the same with
apprentices and “improvers,” for whose labour
the instruction received is generally considered
to be either a sufficient or partial recompense, and
who consequently look to other means for their
support. Under the same head, too, may be
cited the labour of amateurs, that is to say, of
persons who either are not, or who are too proud
to acknowledge themselves, regular members
of the trade at which they work. Such is the
case with very many of the daughters of tradesmen,
and of many who are considered <i>genteel</i>
people. These young women, residing with their
parents, and often in comfortable homes, at no
cost to themselves, will, and do, undersell the
regular needlewomen; the one works merely for
pocket-money (often to possess herself of some
article of finery), while the other works for what
is called “the bare life.”</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The last-mentioned class, or those who are
in possession of what may be called “aids to
wages,” are differently circumstanced. Such are
the men who have other employment besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
that for which they accept less than the ordinary
pay, as is the case with those who attend at
gentlemen’s houses for one or two hours every
morning, cleaning boots, brushing clothes, &amp;c.,
and who, having the remainder of the day at their
own disposal, can afford to work at any calling
cheaper than others, because not solely dependent
upon it for their living.</p>

<p>The army and navy pensioners (non-commissioned
officers and privates) were, at one period,
on the disbanding of the militia and other forces,
a very numerous body, but it was chiefly the
military pensioners whose position had an effect
upon the labour of the country. The naval pensioners
found employment as fishermen, or in some
avocation connected with the sea. The military
pensioners, however, were men who, after a
career of soldiership, were not generally disposed
to settle down into the drudgery of regular work,
even if it were in their power to do so; and so,
as they always had their pensions to depend
upon, they were a sort of universal jobbers, and
jobbed cheaply. At the present time, however,
this means of cheap labour is greatly restricted,
compared with what was the case, the number of
the pensioners being considerably diminished.
Many of the army pensioners turn the wheels for
turners at present.</p>

<p>The allotment of gardens, which yield a partial
support to the allottee, are another means of
cheap labour. The allotment demands a certain
portion of time, but is by no means a thorough
employment, but merely an “aid,” and consequently
a <i>means</i>, to low wages. Such a man has
the advantage of obtaining his potatoes and vegetables
at the cheapest rate, and so can afford to
work cheaper than other men of his class. It
was the same formerly with those who received
“relief” under the old Poor-Law.</p>

<p>And even under the present system it has been
found that the same practice is attended with the
same result. In the Sixth Annual Report of the
Poor-Law Commissioners, 1840, at p. 31, there are
the following remarks on the <span class="lock">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Whilst upon the subject of relief to widows
in aid of wages, we must not omit to bring under
your Lordship’s notice an illustration of the
<i>depressing effect</i> which is produced by the practice
of giving relief in aid of wages to widows
upon the earnings of females. Colonel A’Court
<span class="lock">states:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘As regards females, the instance to which I
have alluded presents itself in the Portsea Island
Union, where, from the insufficiency of workhouse
accommodation, as well as from benevolent feelings,
small allowances of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> a week
are given to widows with or without small children,
or to married women deserted by their
husbands. <i>Having this certain income, however
small, they are enabled to work at lower wages
than those who do not possess this advantage.</i>
The consequence is, that competition has enabled
the shirt and stay manufacturers, who abound in
the Union, and who furnish in great measure the
London as well as many foreign markets with
these articles of their trade, to get their work
done at the extraordinary low prices of&mdash;stays,
complete, 9<i>d.</i>; shirts, from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per
dozen.</p>

<p>“‘The women all declare that they cannot
possibly, after working from twelve to fifteen
hours per day, earn more than 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week.
The manufacturers assert that, by steady work,
4<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> a week may be earned under ordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>“‘In the meantime <i>the demand for workwomen
increases</i>, and it is by no means unusual to see
hand-bills posted over the town requiring from
500 to 1000 additional stitchers.’”</p>

<p>Such, then, is the character of the cheap workers
in all trades; go where we will, we shall find the
low-priced labour of the trade to consist of either
one or other of the three classes above-mentioned;
while the <i>means</i> by which this labour is brought
into operation will be generally by one of the
“systems of work” before specified.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The cheap labour of the rubbish-carters’ trade
appears to be a consequence of two distinct antecedents,
viz., casual labour and the prevalence of
the contract system among builder’s work. The
small-master system also appears to have some
influence upon it.</p>

<p>First as regards the influence of casual labour
in reducing the ordinary rate of wages.</p>

<p>The tables given at p. <a href="#Page_289">290</a>, vol. ii., showing the
wages paid to the rubbish-carters, present what appears,
and indeed is, a strange discrepancy of payment
to the labourers in rubbish-carting. About
three-fourths of the rubbish-carters throughout
London receive 18<i>s.</i> weekly, when in work; in
Hampstead, however, the rate of their wages is
(uniformly) 20<i>s.</i> a week; in Lambeth (but less
uniformly), it is 19<i>s.</i>; in Wandsworth, 17<i>s.</i>; in
Islington, 16<i>s.</i>; and in Greenwich, 14<i>s.</i> and 12<i>s.</i>
The character of the work, whether executed
for 12<i>s.</i> or 20<i>s.</i> weekly, is the same; why, then,
can a rubbish-carter, who works at Hampstead,
earn 8<i>s.</i> a week more than one who works at
Greenwich? An employer of rubbish-carters, and
of similar labourers, on a large scale, a gentleman
thoroughly conversant with the subject in all its
industrial bearings, accounts for the discrepancy
in this <span class="lock">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>After the corn and the hop-harvests have terminated,
there is always an influx of unskilled
labourers into Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich.
These are the men who, from the natural
bent of their dispositions, or from the necessity of
their circumstances, resort to the casual labour
afforded by the revolution of the seasons, when
to gather the crops before the weather may render
the harvest precarious and its produce unsound,
is a matter of paramount necessity, and
the increase of hands employed during this season
is, as a consequence, proportionately great.
The chief scene of such labour in the neighbourhood
of the metropolis, is in the county of Kent;
and on the cessation of this work, of course there
is a large amount of labour “turned adrift,” to
seek, the next few days, for any casual employment
that may “turn up.” In this way, I am assured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
a large amount of cheap and unskilled labour is
being constantly placed at the command of those
masters who, so to speak, occupy the line of march
to London, and are, therefore, first applied to for
employment by casual labourers; who, when engaged,
are employed as inferior, or unskilful,
workmen, at an inferior rate of remuneration.
Greenwich may be looked upon as the first stage
or halt for casual labourers, on their way to London.</p>

<p>My informant assured me, as the result of his
own observations, that an English labourer would,
as a general rule, execute more work by one-sixth,
in a week, than an Irish labourer (a large proportion
of the casual hands are Irish); that is, the
extent of work which would occupy the Irishman
six, would occupy the Englishman but five days,
were it so calculated. The Englishman was, however,
usually more skilled and persevering, and
far more to be depended upon. So different was
the amount of work, even in rubbish-carting,
between an able and experienced hand and one
unused to the toil, or one inadequate from want of
alertness or bodily strength, or any other cause,
to its full and quick execution, that two “good”
men in a week have done as much work as three
indifferent hands. Thus two men at 18<i>s.</i> weekly
each are as cheap (only employers cannot always
see it), when they are thorough masters of their
business, as three unready hands at 12<i>s.</i> a week
each. The misfortune, however, is, that the 12<i>s.</i>
a week men have a tendency to reduce the 16<i>s.</i>
to their level.</p>

<p>With regard to the difference between the
wages of Hampstead and Greenwich, I am informed
that stationary working rubbish-carters are
not too numerous in Hampstead, which is considered
as rather “out of the way;” and as that
metropolitan suburb is surrounded in every direction
by pasture-land and wood-land, it is not in
the line of resort of the class of men who seek
the casual labour in harvesting, &amp;c., of which I
have spoken; it is rarely visited by them, and
consequently, the regular hands are less interfered
with than elsewhere, and wages have not been
deteriorated.</p>

<p>The mode of work among the scurf labourers
differs somewhat from that of the honourable
part of the trade; the work executed by the
scurf masters being for the most part on a more
limited scale than that of the others. To meet
the demands of builders or of employers generally,
when “time” is an object, demands the use
of relays of men, and of strong horses. This
demand the smaller or scurf master cannot always
meet. He may find men, but not always horses
and carts, and he will often enough undertake
work beyond his means and endeavour to aggrandise
his profits by screwing his labourers. The
<i>hours of scurf-employed labour</i> are nominally the
same as the regular trade, but as an Irish carter
said, “it’s ralely the hours the masther plases, and
they’re often as long as it’s light.” The <i>scurf
labourer is often paid by the day</i>, with “a day’s
hire, and no notice beyond.” I am informed
that scurf labourers generally work an hour a
day, without extra remuneration, longer than those
in the honourable trade.</p>

<p>The rubbish-carters employed by the scurf
masters are not, as a body, I am assured, so badly
paid as they were a few years back. It is rarely
that labouring men can advance any feasible
reason for the changes in their trade.</p>

<p><i>One of the main causes of the deteriorated wages</i>
of the rubbish-carters is the system of contracting
and subletting. This, however, is but a
branch of the ramified system of subletting in
the construction of the “scamped” houses of the
speculative builders. The building of such houses
is sublet, literally from cellar to chimney. The
rubbish-carting may be contracted for at a certain
sum. The contractor may sublet it to
men who will do it for one-fourth less perhaps,
and who may sublet the labour in their turn.
For instance, the calculation may be founded on
the working men’s receiving 15<i>s.</i> weekly. A
contractor, a man possessing a horse, perhaps, and
a couple of carts, and hiring another horse, will
undertake it on the knowledge of his being able
to engage men at 12<i>s.</i> or 13<i>s.</i> weekly, and so
obtain a profit; indeed the reduction of price in
such cases must all come out of the labour.</p>

<p>This subletting, I say, is but a small part of a
gigantic system, and it is an unquestionable cause
of the grinding down of the rubbish-carters’
wages, and that by a class who have generally
been working men themselves, and risen to be
the owners of one or two carts and horses.</p>

<p>From one of these men, now a working carter, I
had the following account, which further illustrates
the mode of labour as well as of employment.</p>

<p>“I got a little a-head,” he stated, “from
railway jobbing and such like, and my father-in-law,
as soon as I got married, made me a
present of 20<i>l.</i> unexpected. I started for myself,
thinking to get on by degrees, and get a fresh
horse and cart every year. But it couldn’t be
done, sir. If I offered to take a contract to cart
the rubbish and dig it, a builder would say,&mdash;‘I
can’t wait; you haven’t carts and horses
enough from your own account, and I can’t wait.
If you have to hire them I can do that myself.’
I was too honest, sir, in telling the plain truth, or
I might have got more jobs. It’s not a good
trade in a small way, for if your horses aren’t at
work, they’re eating their heads off, and you’re
fretting your heart out. Then I got to do sub-contracting,
as you call it. No, it weren’t that, it
was under-working. I’d go to Mr. <span class="lock">V&mdash;&mdash;</span> as I
knew, and say, ‘You’re on such a place, sir, have
you room for me?’ ‘I think not,’ he’d say, ‘I’ve
only the regular thing and no advantages&mdash;10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
for a day’s work, horse and cart, or 4<i>s.</i> a load.’
Those are the regular terms. Then I’d say,
‘Well, sir, I’ll do it for 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and be my own
carman;’ and so perhaps I’d get the job, and
masters often say: ‘I know I shall lose at
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but if I don’t, you shall have something
over.’ Get anything over! Of course not, sir. I
could have lived if I had constant work for two
horses and carts, for I would have got a cheap
man; such as me must get cheap men to drive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
second cart, and under my own eye, whenever I
could; but one of my poor horses broke his leg,
and had to be sent to the knacker’s, and I sold the
other and my carts, and have worked ever since
as a labouring man; mainly at pipe-work. O,
yes, and rubbish-carting. I get 18<i>s.</i> a week now,
but not regular.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’m sure I can’t say, and I think
no man could say, how much there’s doing in sub-contracting.
If I’m at work in Cannon-street, I
don’t know what’s doing at Notting-hill, or beyond
Bow and Stratford. No, I’m satisfied
there’s not so much of it as there was, but it’s
done so on the sly; who knows how much is done
still, or how little? It’s a system as may be
carried on a long time, and is carried on, as far as
men’s labour goes, but it’s different where
there’s horses, and stable rent. They can’t be
screwed, or under-fed, beyond a certain pitch, or
they couldn’t work at all, and so there’s not as
much under-work about horse-labour.”</p>

<p>These small men are among the scurf and petty
rubbish-carters, and are often the means of depressing
the class to which they have belonged.</p>

<p>The employment in the honourable trade at
rubbish-carting would be one of the best among
unskilled labourers, were it continuous. But it is
not continuous, and three-fourths of those engaged
in it have only six months’ work at it in the year.
In the scurf-masters’ employ, the work is really
“casual,” or, as I heard it quite as often described,
“chance.” In both departments of this
trade, the men out of work look for a job in
scavagery, and very generally in night-work, or,
indeed, in any labour that offers. The Irish rubbish-carters
will readily become hawkers of
apples, oranges, walnuts, and even nuts, when out
of employ, so working in concert with their wives.
I heard of only four instances of a similar resource
by the English rubbish-carters.</p>

<p>What I have said of the education, religion,
politics, concubinage, &amp;c., &amp;c., of the better-paid
rubbish-carters would have but to be repeated, if
I described those of the under-paid. The latter
may be more reckless when they have the means
of enjoyment, but their diet, amusements, and
expenditure would be the same, were their means
commensurate. As it is, they sometimes live very
barely and have hardly any amusements at their
command. Their dinners, when single men, are
often bread and a saveloy; when married, sometimes
tea and bread and butter, and occasionally
some “block ornaments;” the Irish being the
principal consumers of cheap fish.</p>

<p>The labour of the wives of the rubbish-carters
is far more frequently that of char-women than
of needle-women, for the great majority of these
women before their marriage were servant-maids.
All the information I received was concurrent in
that respect. The wife of a carman who keeps a
chandler’s shop near the Edgeware-road, greatly
resorted to by the class to which her husband
belonged, told me that out of somewhere about 25
wives of rubbish-carters or similar workmen,
whom she knew, 20 had been domestic servants;
what the others had been she did not know.</p>

<p>“I can tell you, sir,” said the woman, “charing
is far better than needle-work; far. If a young
woman has conducted herself well in service, she
can get charing, and then if she conducts herself
well again, she makes good friends. That’s, of
course, if they’re honest, sir. I know it from experience.
My husband&mdash;before we were able to
open this shop&mdash;was in the hospital a long time,
and I went out charing, and did far better than a
sister I have, who is a capital shirt-maker. There’s
broken victuals, sometimes, for your children. It’s
a hard world, sir, but there’s a many good people
in it.”</p>

<p>One woman (before mentioned) earned not less
than 5<i>s.</i> weekly in superior shirt-making, as
it was described to me, which was evidently
looked upon as a handsome remuneration for
such toil. Another earned 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; another
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and others, with uncertain employ, 2<i>s.</i>,
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and in some weeks nothing. Needle-work,
however, is, I am informed, not the work of one-tenth
of the rubbish-carters’ wives, whatever the
earnings of the husband. From all I could learn,
too, the wives of the under-paid rubbish-carters
earned more, by from 10 to 20 per cent., than those
of the better-paid. The earnings of a charwoman
in average employ, as regards the wives
of the rubbish-carters, is about 4<i>s.</i> weekly,
without the exhausting toil of the needle-woman,
and with the advantage of sometimes receiving
broken meat, dripping, fat, &amp;c., &amp;c. The wives
of the Irish labourers in this trade are often all
the year street-sellers, some of wash-leathers,
some of cabbage-nets, and some of fruit, clearing
perhaps from 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> a day, if used to street-trading,
as the majority of them are.</p>

<p>The under-paid labourers in this trade are
chiefly poor Irishmen. The Irish workmen in
this branch of the trade have generally been
brought up “on the land,” as they call it, in their
own country, and after the sufferings of many of
them during the famine, 12<i>s.</i> a week is regarded
as “a rise in the world.”</p>

<p>From one of this class I learned the following
particulars. He seemed a man of 26 or <span class="lock">28:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was brought up on the land, sir,” he said,
“not far from Cullin, in the county Wexford. I
lived with my father and mother, and shure we
were badly off. Shure, thin, we were. Father
and mother&mdash;the Heavens be their bed&mdash;died one
soon after another, and some friends raised me the
manes to come to this country. Well, thin,
indeed, sir, and I can’t say how they raised them,
God reward them. I got to Liverpool, and walked
to London, where I had some relations. I sold
oranges in the strates the first day I was in
London. God help me, I was glad to do anything
to get a male’s mate. I’ve lived on 6<i>d.</i>
a-day sometimes. I have indeed. There was 2<i>d.</i>
for the lodging, and 4<i>d.</i> for the mate, the tay and
bread and butter. Did I live harder than that in
Ireland, your honour? Well, thin, I have. I’ve
lived on a dish of potatoes that might cost a penny
there, where things is bhutiful and chape. Not
like this country. No, no. I wouldn’t care to go
back. I have no friends there now. Thin I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ingaged by a man&mdash;yis, he was a rubbish-carter&mdash;to
help him to fill his cart, and then we shot it on
some new garden grounds, and had to shovel it
about to make the grounds livil, afore the top soil
was put on, for the bhutiful flowers and the gravel
walks. Tim&mdash;yis, he was a counthryman of mine,
but a Cor-rk man&mdash;said he’d made a bad bargain,
for he was bad off, and he only clared 4<i>d.</i> a load,
and he’d divide it wid me. We did six loads in
a day, and I got 1<i>s.</i> every night for a wake.
This was a rise. But one Sunday evening I was
standing talking with people as lived in the same
coort, and I tould how I was helping Tim. And
two Englishmen came to find four men as they
wanted for work, and ould Ragin (Regan) tould
them what I was working for. And one of ’em
said, I was ‘a <span class="lock">b&mdash;&mdash;</span> Irish fool,’ and ould Ragin
said so, and words came on, and thin there was a
fight, and the pelleece came, and thin the fight
was harder. I was taken to the station, and had
a month. I had two black eyes next morning,
but was willin’ to forget and forgive. No, I’m
not fond of fightin’. I’m a paceable man, glory
be to God, and I think I was put on. Oh, yis,
and indeed thin, your honour, it was a fair fight.”</p>

<p>I inquired of an English rubbish-carter as to
these fair fights. He knew nothing of the one in
question, but had seen such fights. They were
usually among the Irish themselves, but sometimes
Englishmen were “drawn into them.” “Fair
fights! sir,” he said, “why the Irishes don’t stand up
to you like men. They don’t fight like Christians,
sir; not a bit of it. They kick, and scratch, and
bite, and tear, like devils, or cats, or women.
They’re soon settled if you can get an honest
knock at them, but it isn’t easy.”</p>

<p>“I sarved my month,” continued my Irish informant,
“and it ain’t a bad place at all, the prison.
I tould the gintleman that had charge of us, that
I was a Roman Catholic, God be praised, and
couldn’t go to his prayers. ‘O very well, Pat,’
says he. And next day the praste came, and we
were shown in to him, and very angry he was,
and said our conduc’ was a disgrace to religion, and
to our counthry, and to him. Do I think he was
right, sir? God knows he was, or he wouldn’t
have said so.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t been out of prison two hours before
I was hired for a job, at 10<i>s.</i> a week. It was in
the city, and I carried old bricks and rubbish
along planks, from the inside of a place as was
pulled down; but the outside, all but the roof, was
standin’ until the windor frames, and the door
posts, and what other timbers there was, was
sould. It was dreadful hard work, carrying the
basket of rubbish on your back to the cart. The
dust came through, and stuck to my neck, for I
was wet all over wid sweatin’ so. Every man
was allowed a pint of beer a day, and I thought
nivver anything was so sweet. I don’t know who
gave it. The masther, I suppose. Will, thin,
sir, I don’t know who was the masther; it was
John Riley as ingaged me, but <i>he’s</i> no masther.
Yis, thin, and I’ve been workin’ that way ivver
since. I’ve sometimes had 14<i>s.</i> a week, and
sometimes 10<i>s.</i>, and sometimes 12<i>s.</i> A man like
me must take what he can get, and I will take it.
I’ve been out of work sometimes, but not so much
as some, for I’m young and strong. No, I can’t
save no money, and I have nothing just now to
save it for. When I’m out of work, I sell fruit
in the streets.”</p>

<p>This statement, then, as regards the Irish
labourers, shows the quality of the class employed.
The English labourers, working on the
same terms, are of the usual class of men so
working,&mdash;broken-down men, unable, or accounting
themselves unable, to “do better,” and so accepting
any offer affording the means of their daily bread.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap"><a id="Of_the_London_Chimney-Sweepers"></a>Of the London Chimney-Sweepers.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Chimney-Sweepers are a consequence of two
things&mdash;chimneys and the use of coals as fuel; and
these are both commodities of comparatively recent
introduction.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the earliest mention
of <i>chimneys</i> is in an Italian MS., preserved
in Venice, in which it is recorded that chimneys
were thrown down in that city from the shock of
an earthquake in 1347. In England, down even
to the commencement of the reign of Elizabeth,
the greater part of the houses in our towns had
no chimneys; the fire was kindled on a hearth-stone
on the floor, or on a raised grate against the
wall or in the centre of the apartment, and the
smoke found its way out of the doors, windows,
or casements.</p>

<p>During the long, and&mdash;as regards civil strife&mdash;generally
peaceful, reign of Elizabeth, the use of
chimneys increased. In a Discourse prefixed to
an edition of Holinshed’s “Chronicles,” in 1577,
Harrison, the writer, complains, among other
things, “marvellously altered for the worse in
England,” of the multitude of chimneys erected
of late. “Now we have many chimneys,” he
says, “and our tenderlings complain of rheums,
catarrhs, and poses. Then we had none but <i>reredoses</i>,
and our heads did never ache.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> He demurs,
too, to the change in the material of which
the houses were constructed: “Houses were once
builded of willow, then we had oaken men; but
now houses are made of oak, and our men not
only become willow, but a great many altogether
of straw, which is a sore alteration.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>
<p>In Shakespeare’s time, the chimney-sweepers
seem to have become a recognised class of public
cleansers, for in “Cymbeline” the poet <span class="lock">says&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Nor the furious winter’s rages;</div>
      <div class="verse">Thou thy worldly task hast done,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:</div>
      <div class="verse">Golden lads and girls all must,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2"><i>As chimney-sweepers</i> come to dust.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this beautiful passage there is an intimation,
by the “chimney-sweepers” being contrasted with
the “golden lads and girls,” that their employment
was regarded as of the meanest, a repute it
bears to the present day.</p>

<p>But chimneys seem, like the “sweeps” or
“sweepers,” to have been a necessity of a change
of fuel. In the days of “rere-dosses,” our ancestors
burnt only wood, so that they were not
subjected to so great an inconvenience as we
should be were our fires kindled without the vent
of the chimney. Our fuel is coal, which produces
a greater quantity of soot, and of black smoke,
which is the result of imperfect combustion, than
any other fuel, the smoke from wood being thin
and pure in comparison.</p>

<p>The first mention of the use of coal as fuel
occurs in a charter of Henry III., granting licence
to the burgesses of Newcastle to dig for coal. In
1281 Newcastle is said to have had some slight
trade in this article. Shortly afterwards coal
began to be imported into London for the use of
smiths, brewers, dyers, soap-boilers, &amp;c. In
1316, during the reign of Edward I., its use in
London was prohibited because of the supposed
injurious influence of the smoke. In 1600 the use
of coal in the metropolis became universal; about
200 vessels were employed in the London trade,
and about 200,000 chaldrons annually imported.</p>

<p>In 1848, however, there were, besides the
railway-borne coals, 12,267 cargoes imported, or
3,418,340 tons. The London coal trade now
employs 2700 vessels and 21,600 seamen, and
constitutes one-fourth of the whole general trade
of the Thames.</p>

<p>To understand the <i>necessity</i> for chimney-sweepers,
and the extent of the work for them to do, that is
to say, the quantity of soot deposited in our
chimneys during the combustion of the three and a
half millions of tons of coals that are now annually
consumed in London, we must first comprehend the
conditions upon which the evolution of soot depends,
soot being simply the fine carbonaceous particles
condensed from the smoke of coal fuel, and deposited
against the sides of the chimneys during
its ascent between the walls to the tops of our
houses. These conditions appear to have been
determined somewhat accurately during the investigations
of the Smoke Prevention Committee.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of smoke from the ordinary
materials of combustion&mdash;(A) <i>Opaque</i>, or black
smoke; (B) <i>Transparent</i>, or invisible smoke.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. The <i>Opaque</i> smoke, though the most offensive
and annoying from its dirtying properties, is,
like the muddiest water, the least injurious to
animal or vegetable health. It consists of the
particles of unconsumed carbon which have not
been deposited in the form of soot in the flue or
chimney. This is the black smoke which will be
further described.</p>

<p>B. <i>Transparent</i> smoke is composed of gases
which are for the most part invisible, such as carbonic
acid and carbonic oxide; also of sulphurous
acid, but smokes with that component are both
visible and invisible. The sulphurous acid is said
by Professor Brande to destroy vegetation, for it
has long been a cause of wonder why vegetation
in towns did not flourish, since carbonic acid
(which is so largely produced from the action of our
fires) is the vital air of trees, shrubs, and plants<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>
<p>I may here observe, that several of the scientific
men who gave the results of years of observation
and study in their evidence to the Committee of
the House of Commons, remarked on the popular
misunderstanding of what smoke was, it being generally
regarded as something <i>visible</i>. But in the
composition of smoke, it appears, one product may
be visible, and another invisible, and both offensive;
while “occasionally you may have from the
same materials varieties of products, all invisible,
according to the manner to which they are supplied
with air.”</p>

<p>The Committee requested Dr. Reid to prepare
a definition of “smoke,” and more especially of
“black smoke.” The following is the substance
of the doctor’s definition, or rather <span class="lock">description:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Black Smoke</i> consists essentially of carbon
separated by heat from coal or other combustible
bodies. If this smoke be produced at a very high
temperature, the carbon forms a loose and powdery
soot, comparatively free from other substances;
while the lower the temperature at
which black soot is formed, the larger is the
amount of other substances with which it is
mingled, among which are the following:&mdash;carbon,
water, resin, oily and other inflammable
products of various volatilities, ammonia, and
carbonate of ammonia.</p>

<p>When the carbon, oils, resin, and water are
associated together in certain proportions, they
constitute <i>tar</i>. <i>Soft pitch</i> is produced if the tar
be so far heated that the water is expelled; and
<i>hard pitch</i> (resin blackened by carbon) when the
oils are volatilized.</p>

<p>In all cases of ordinary combustion, carbonic
acid is formed by the red-hot cinders, or by gases
or other compounds containing carbon, acting on
the oxygen of the air. This carbonic acid is
discharged in general as an <i>invisible</i> gas. If the
carbonic acid pass through red-hot cinders, or any
carbonaceous smoke at a high temperature, it
loses one particle of oxygen, and becomes carbonic
oxide gas. The lost oxygen, uniting with
carbon, forms an additional amount of carbonic
oxide gas, which passes to the external atmosphere
as an invisible gas, unless kindled in its progress,
or at the top of the chimney, when its temperature
is sufficiently elevated by the action of air.
Carbonic oxide gas burns with a blue flame, and
produces carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>Black smoke is always associated with carburetted
hydrogen gases. These may be mechanically
blended with the oils and resins, but must
be carefully distinguished from them. They
form more essentially, when in a state of combustion,
the inflammable matters that constitute
flame.</p>

<p>2. <i>Smoke from Charcoal, Coke, and Anthracite</i>,
is always invisible if the material be dry. A
flame may appear, however, if carbonic oxide be
formed.</p>

<p>3. <i>Wood or Pyroligneous Smoke</i> is rarely
black. Water and carbonic acid are the products
of the full combustion of wood, omitting the consideration
of the ash that remains.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sulphurous Smokes.</i> Tons of sulphur are
annually evolved in various conditions from copper-works.
Offensive sulphurous smokes are often
evolved from various chemical works, as gas-works,
acid-works, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. <i>Hydrochloric Acid Smoke</i> is evolved in
general in large quantities from alkali works.</p>

<p>6. <i>Metallic Smokes</i>&mdash;when ores of lead, copper,
arsenic, &amp;c., are used&mdash;often contain offensive
matter in a minute state of division, and suspended
in the smoke evolved from the furnaces.</p>

<p>7. <i>Putrescent Smokes</i>, loaded with the products
of decayed animal and vegetable matter, are
evolved at times from drains in visible vapours,
more especially in damp weather. The fœtid particles,
when associated with moisture in this
smoke, are entirely decomposed when subjected to
heat.</p>

<p>Dr. Ure says, speaking of the cause of the
ordinary black smoke above described, “The inevitable
conversion of atmospheric air into carbonic
acid has been hitherto the radical defect of
almost all furnaces. The consequence is, that
this gaseous matter is mixed with an atmosphere
containing far too little oxygen, and instead of
burning the carbon and hydrogen, which constitute
the coal gases, the carbon is deposited partly
in a pulverized form, constituting smoke or soot,
and a great deal of the carbon gets half-burnt,
and forms what is well known under the name
of carbonic oxide, which is half-burnt charcoal.”</p>

<p>“The ordinary smoke,” Professor Faraday
said, in his examination before the Committee,
“is the visible black part of the products, the
unburnt portions of the carbon. If you prevent
the production of carbonic oxide or carbonic acid,
you increase the production of smoke. You must
with coal fuel either have carbonic acid or oxide,
or else black smoke.</p>

<p>“Which is the least noxious?” he was asked,
and answered, “As far as regards health, carbonic
acid and carbonic oxide are most noxious to
health; but it is not so much a question of
health as of cleanliness and comfort, because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
believe that this town is as healthy as other
places where there are not these fires.</p>

<p>“It is partly the impure coal gas evolved after
the fresh charge of coal which originates the
smokes, when not properly supplied with air; but
it is a very mixed question. When a fresh
charge of coal is put upon the fire, a great quantity
of evaporable matter, which would be called
impure coal gas according to the language
of the question, is produced; and as that matter
travels on in the heated place, if there be a
sufficient supply of air, both the hydrogen and the
carbon are entirely burnt. But if there be an
insufficient supply of air, the hydrogen is taken
possession of first, and the carbon is set free in its
black and solid form; and if that goes into the
cool part of the chimney before fresh air gets to
it, that carbon is so carried out into the atmosphere
and is the smoke in question. Generally
speaking, the great rush of smoke is when coal is
first put on the fire; and that from the want of a
sufficient supply of oxygen at the right time,
because the carbon is cooled so low as not to take
fire.”</p>

<p>This eminent chemist stated also that there
was no difference in the ultimate chemical effect
upon the air between a wood fire and a coal fire, but
with wood there was not so much smoke set free in
the heated place, which caused a difference in the
gaseous products of wood combustion and of coal
combustion. He thought that perhaps wood
was the fuel which would be most favourable to
health as affecting the atmosphere, inasmuch as it
produced more water, and less carbonic acid, as
the product of combustion.</p>

<p>What may be called the <i>peculiarities</i> of a
smoky and sooty atmosphere are of course more
strongly developed in London than elsewhere, as
the following curious statements <span class="lock">show:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. Reid, in describing metropolitan smoke,
spoke of “those black portions of soot that every
one is familiar with, which annoy us, for instance,
at the Houses of Parliament to such an extent
that I have been under the necessity of putting
up a veil, about 40 feet long and 12 feet deep, on
which, on a single evening, taking the worst kind
of weather for the production of soot, we can
count occasionally 200,000 visible portions of soot
excluded at a single sitting. We count with the
naked eye the number of pieces entangled upon a
square inch. I have examined the amount deposited
on different occasions in different parts of
London at the tops of some houses; and on one
occasion at the Horse Guards the amount of soot
deposited was so great, that it formed a complete
and continuous film, so that when I walked upon
it I saw the impression of my foot left as distinctly
on that occasion as when snow lies upon
the ground. The film was exceedingly thin, but
I could discover no want of continuity. On other
occasions I have noticed in London that the quantity
that escapes into individual houses is so
great that in a single night I have observed a
mixture of soot and of hoar frost collecting at the
edge of the door, and forming a stripe three-quarters
of an inch in breadth, and bearing an
exact resemblance to a pepper and salt grey cloth.
Those that I refer to are extreme occasions.”</p>

<p>Mr. Booth mentioned, that one of the gardeners
of the Botanic Garden in the Regent’s-park,
could tell the number of days sheep had
been in the park from the blackness of their wool,
its oleaginous power retaining the black.</p>

<p>Dr. Ure informed the Committee that a column
of smoke might be seen extending in different
directions round London, according to the way of
the wind, for a distance of from 20 to 30 miles;
and that Sir William Herschel had told him that
when the wind blew from London he could not
use his great telescope at Slough.</p>

<p>It was stated, moreover, that when a respirator
is washed, the water is rendered dirty by the particles
of soot adhering to the wire gauze, and
which, but for this, would have entered the
mouth.</p>

<p>Professor Brande said, on the subject of the
public health being affected by smoke, “I cannot
say that my opinion is that smoke produces any
unhealthiness in London; it is a great nuisance
certainly; but I do not think we have any good
evidence that it produces disease of any kind.”</p>

<p>“This Committee,” said Mr. Beckett, “have
been told that, by the mechanical effects of smoke
upon the chest and lungs, disease takes place;
that is, by swallowing a certain quantity of
smoke the respiratory organs are injured; can you
give any opinion upon that?”&mdash;“One would conceive,”
replied the Professor, “that that is the
case; but when we compare the health of London
with that of any other town or place where they
are comparatively free or quite free from smoke,
we do not find that difference which we should
expect in regard to health.”</p>

<p>Mr. E. Solly, lecturer on chemistry at the
Royal Institution, expressed his opinion of the
effect of smoke upon the health of <span class="lock">towns:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My impression is,” he said, “that it produces
decided evil in two or three ways: first, mechanically;
the solid black carbonaceous matter produces
a great deal of disease; it occasions dirt
amongst the lower orders, and, if they will not
take pains to remove it, it engenders disease. If
we could do away the smoke nuisance, I believe a
great deal of that disease would be put an end to.
But there is another point, and that is, the bad
effects produced by the gases, sulphurous acid and
other compounds of that nature, which are given
out. If we do away with smoke, we shall still
have those gases; and I have no doubt that
those gases produce a great part of the disease
that is produced by smoke.”</p>

<p>On the other hand Dr. Reid thought that smoke
was more injurious from the dirt it created than
from causing impurity in the atmosphere, although
“it was obvious enough that the inspiration of a
sooty atmosphere must be injurious to persons of a
delicate constitution.” Dr. Ure pronounced smoke,
in the common sense of visible black smoke, unwholesome,
but “not so eminently as the French
imagine.”</p>

<p>Many witnesses stated their conviction that
where poor people resided amongst smoke, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
felt it impossible to preserve cleanliness in their
persons or their dwellings, and that made them
careless of their homes and indifferent to a decency
of appearance, so that the public-house, and places
where cleanliness and propriety were in no great
estimation, became places of frequent resort, on the
plain principle that if a man’s home were uncomfortable,
he was not likely to stay in it.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mr. Booth, “one great effect
of the evil of smoke is upon the dwellings of the
poor; it renders them less attentive to their personal
appearance, and, in consequence, to their
social condition.”</p>

<p>It was also stated that there were “certain districts
inhabited by the poor, where they will not
hang out their clothes to be cleansed; they say it is
of no use to do it, they will become dirty as before,
and consequently they do not have their clothes
washed.” The districts specified as presenting
this characteristic are St. George’s-in-the East and
the neighbourhood of Old-street, St. Luke’s.</p>

<p>It must not be lost sight of, that whatever evils,
moral or physical, without regarding merely pecuniary
losses, are inflicted by the excess of smoke,
they fall upon the poor, and almost solely on the
poor. It is the poor who must reside, as was
said, and with a literality not often applicable to
popular phrases, “in the thick of it,” and consequently
there must either be increased washing
or increased dirt.</p>

<p>To effect the mitigation of the nuisance of
smoke, two points were <span class="lock">considered:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. The substitution of some other material,
containing less bituminous matter, for the “Newcastle
coal.”</p>

<p>B. The combustion of the smoke, before its
emission into the atmospheric air, by means of
mechanical contrivances founded on scientific principles.</p></div>

<p>As regards the first consideration (A) it was
recommended that anthracite, or stone Welsh
coal, which is a smokeless fuel, should be used
instead of the Newcastle coal. This coal is almost
the sole fuel in Philadelphia, a city of Quaker
neatness beyond any in the United States of
North America, and sometimes represented as the
cleanest in the world. The anthracite coal is
somewhat dearer than Newcastle coal in London,
but only in a small degree.</p>

<p><i>Coke</i> was also recommended as a substitute for
coal in private dwellings.</p>

<p>“Are you of opinion,” Dr. Reid was asked,
“that smoke may be in a great measure prevented
by extending the use of gas and coke?” He
answered, “In numerous cities, where large quantities
of gas are produced, coke is very frequently
the principal fuel of the poor, and the difficulty of
lighting that coke, and the difficulty of having
heat developed by it in sufficient quantity, necessarily
led me to look at the construction of the
fire-places adapted for it. And on a general review
of the question, I do entertain the opinion,
that if education were more extended amongst the
humblest classes with respect to the economy of
their own fireside (I mean, literally, the fire-place,
at present), and if gas were greatly extended, so
that they did not drain the coal of the gas-works
of the last dregs of gaseous matter, which are of
very little use as gas, and more to be considered
as adding to the bulk for sale than as valuable
gas, that a coke might be left which would be
easily accendible, which would be economical, and
which, if introduced into fire-places where an open
fire is desired, would <i>entirely remove the necessity
of sweeping chimneys even with machines</i>, and
would at the same time give as economical a fire
as any ordinary fire-place can produce, for an
ordinary coal fire rarely is powerful in its calorific
emanations till the mass of gas has been expelled,
and we see the cherry-red fire. The amount of
gas that has escaped previously to the production
or coking of the fire, is the gas that is valuable in
a manufactory, and if therefore the individual
consumer could have, not the hard-burnt stony
coke, but the soft coke, in the condition that
would give at once a cherry-red fire, we should
attain the two great objects&mdash;of economising gas,
and at the same time of having a lively cheerful
fire. Then this led me to look particularly at the
price of a gas lamp for a poor man. In a poor
man’s family, where the breakfast, the tea and
dinner, require the principal attention, and he has
some plain cooking utensils, in the heat of summer
I believe that he will produce as much heat as he
wants for those purposes from a single burner,
which can be turned on and left all day, which
shall not risk any boiling over, and by having this
pure heat directed to the object to be warmed,
instead of having a heavy iron grate, this plan
would, if gas were generally introduced even into
the humblest apartments, prove a great source of
economy in summer.”</p>

<p>Dr. Reid also told the Committee that there
was a great prejudice against the use of coke,
many persons considering that it produced a
sulphurous smell; but as all ordinary coal coked
itself, or became coke in an open fire, and was
never powerfully calorific till it became coke, the
prejudice would die away.</p>

<p>Very little is said in the Report about the
smoke of private houses; an allusion, however, is
made to that portion of the investigation:&mdash;“Your
Committee have received the most gratifying
assurances of the confident hope entertained by
several of the highest scientific authorities examined
by them, that the black smoke proceeding
from fires in private dwellings, and all other places,
may eventually be entirely prevented, either by the
adoption of stoves and grates formed for a perfect
combustion of the common bituminous coal, or by
the use of coke, or of anthracite; but they are of
opinion that the present knowledge on that subject
is not such as to justify any legislative interference
with these smaller fires.”</p>

<p>“I should, in prospect,” Professor Faraday said
to the Committee, “look forward to the possibility
of a great reduction of the smoke from coal fires
in houses; but my impression is, that, in the present
state of things, it would be tyrannical to determine
that that must be done which at present
we do not know can be done. Still, I think there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
is reason to believe that it can be effected in a
very high degree.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ure also thought that to extend any smoke
enactment to private dwellings might be tyrannical
in the present state of the chimneys, but he
had no doubt that smoke might be consumed in
fires in private dwellings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, then, are the causes and remedies for
smoke, and consequently of soot, for smoke, or
rather opaque smoke, consists, as we have seen,
of merely the gases of combustion with minute
particles of carbon diffused throughout them;
and as smoke is the result of the imperfect
burning of our coals, it follows that chimney-sweepers
are but a consequence of our ignorance,
and that, as we grow wiser in the art of economising
our fuel, we shall be gradually displacing
this branch of labourers&mdash;the means of preventing
smoke being simply the mode of displacing
the chimney-sweepers&mdash;and this is another of the
many facts to teach us that not only are we doubling
our population in forty years, but we are
likewise learning every year how to do our work
with a less number of workers, either by inventing
some piece of mechanism that will enable one
“hand” to do as much as one hundred, or else
doing away with some branch of labour altogether.
Here lies the great difficulty of the
time. A new element&mdash;science, with its offspring,
steam&mdash;has been introduced into our society within
the last century, decreasing labour at a time when
the number of our labourers has been increasing
at a rate unexampled in history; and the problem
is, how to reconcile the new social element with
the old social institutions, doing as little injury as
possible to the community.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, the “smoke nuisance”
entirely prevented, and that Professor Faraday’s
prophecy as to the great reduction of the smoke
from coal fires in houses were fulfilled, and that
the expectations of the sanguine and intense
Committee, who tell us that they have “received
<i>the most gratifying</i> assurances of the <i>confident</i>
hope entertained by several of <i>the highest scientific</i>
authorities, that the black smoke proceeding from
fires in private dwellings and all other places may
be eventually <i>entirely</i> prevented,”&mdash;suppose that
these expectations, I say, be realized (and there
appears to be little doubt of the matter), what is
to become of the 1000 to 1500 “sweeps” who
live, as it were, upon this very smoke? Surely
the whole community should not suffer for them,
it will be said. True; but unfortunately the
same argument is being applied to each particular
section of the labouring class,&mdash;and the labourers
make up by far the greater part of the community.
If we are daily displacing a thousand labourers by
the annihilation of this process, and another
thousand by the improvement of that, what is to
be the fate of those we put on one side? and
where shall we find employment for the hundred
thousand new “hands” that are daily coming
into existence among us? This is the great problem
for earnest thoughtful men to work out!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But we have to deal here with the chimney-sweepers
as they are, and not as they may be
in a more scientific age. And, first, as to <i>the
quantity of soot</i> annually deposited at present in
the London chimneys.</p>

<p>The quantity of soot produced in the metropolis
every year may be ascertained in the following
<span class="lock">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The larger houses are swept in some instances
once a month, but generally once in three months,
and yield on an average six bushels of soot
per year. A moderate-sized house, belonging to
the “middle class,” is usually swept four times a
year, and gives about five bushels of soot per
annum; while houses occupied by the working
and poorer classes are seldom swept more than
twice, and sometimes only once, in the twelvemonth,
and yield about two bushels of soot
annually.</p>

<p>The larger houses&mdash;the residences of noblemen
and the more wealthy gentry&mdash;may,
then, be said to produce an average of six
bushels of soot annually; the houses of
the more prosperous tradesmen, about five
bushels; while those of the humbler classes
appear to yield only two bushels of soot per
annum. There are, according to the last returns,
in round numbers, 300,000 inhabited houses at
present in the metropolis, and these, from the
“reports” of the income and property tax, may
be said to consist, as regards the average rentals,
of the proportions given in the next page.</p>

<p>Here we see that the number of houses whose

</table></div>

<p>This calculation will be found to be nearly correct
if tried by another mode. The quantity of soot
depends greatly upon the amount of volatile or
bituminous matter in the coals used. By a table
given at p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a> of the second volume of this work
it will be seen that the proportion of volatile
matter contained in the several kinds of coal are
as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Cannel or gas coals contain 40 to 60 per cent.
of volatile matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>


<p>Newcastle or “house” coals, about 37 per cent.</p>

<p>Lancashire and Yorkshire coals, 35 to 40 per
cent.</p>

<p>South Welsh or “steam” coals, 11 to 15 per
cent.</p>

<p>Anthracite or “stone” coals, none.</p>

<p>The house coals are those chiefly used throughout
London, so that every ton of such coals contains
about 800 lbs. of volatile matter, a considerable
proportion of which appears in the form of smoke;
but what proportion and what is the weight of
the carbonaceous particles or soot evolved in a
given quantity of smoke, I know of no means of
judging. I am informed, however, by those practically
acquainted with the subject, that a ton
of ordinary house coals will produce between a
fourth and a half of a bushel of soot<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. Now
there are, say, 3,500,000 tons of coal consumed
annually in London; but a large proportion of
this quantity is used for the purposes of gas,
for factories, breweries, chemical works, and
steam-boats. The consumption of coal for the
making of gas in London, in 1849, was 380,000
tons; so that, including the quantity used in
factories, breweries, &amp;c., we may, perhaps,
estimate the domestic consumption of the metropolis
at 2,500,000 tons yearly, which, for
300,000 houses, would give eight tons per house.
And when we remember the amount used in
large houses and in hotels, as well as by the
smaller houses, where each room often contains a
different family, this does not appear to be too
high an average. Mr. M’Culloch estimates the
domestic consumption at one ton per head, men,
women, and children; and since the number of
persons to each house in London is 7·5, this would
give nearly the same result. Estimating the yield
of soot to be three-eighths of a bushel per ton,
we have, in round numbers, 1,000,000 bushels
of soot as the gross quantity deposited in the
metropolitan chimneys every year.</p>

<p>Or, to check the estimate another way, there
are 350 master sweepers throughout London.
A master sweeper in a “large way of business”
collects, I am informed, one day with another,
from 30 to 40 bushels of soot; on the other hand,
a small master, or “single-handed” chimney-sweeper
is able to gather only about 5 bushels, and scarcely
that. One master sweeper said that about 10
bushels a day would, he thought, be a fair average
quantity for all the masters, reckoning one day
with another; so that at this rate we should have
1,095,500 bushels for the gross quantity of soot
annually collected throughout the metropolis.</p>

<p>We may therefore assume the aggregate yield
of soot throughout London to be 1,000,000 bushels
per annum. Now what is done with this immense
mass of refuse matter? Of what use is it?</p>

<p><i>The soot is purchased from the masters, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
perquisite it is, by the farmers and dealers.</i> It is
used by them principally for meadow land, and
frequently for land where wheat is grown; not so
much, I understand, as a manure, as for some
quality in it which destroys slugs and other insects
injurious to the crops<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. Lincolnshire is one of
the great marts for the London soot, whither it
is transported by railway. In Hertfordshire,
Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Kent,
however, and many other parts, London soot is
used in large quantities; there are persons who
have large stores for its reception, who purchase it
from the master sweepers, and afterwards sell it to
the farmers and send it as per order, to its destination.
These are generally the manure-merchants,
of whom the Post-Office Directory gives 26 names,
eight being marked as dealers in guano. I was
told by a sweeper in a large way of business that
he thought these men bought from a half to three-quarters
of the soot; the remainder being bought
by the land-cultivators in the neighbourhood of
London. Soot is often used by gardeners to keep
down the insects which infest their gardens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The value of the Soot</i> collected throughout
London is the next subject to engage our attention.
Many sweepers have represented it as a very
curious fact, and one for which they could advance
no sufficient reason, that the price of a bushel of
soot was regulated by the price of the quartern
loaf, so that you had only to know that the
quartern loaf was 5<i>d.</i> to know that such was the
price of a bushel of soot. This, however, is hardly
the case at present; the price of the quartern loaf
(not regarding the “seconds,” or inferior bread),
is now, at the end of December, 1851, 5<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>
according to quality. The price of soot per bushel
is but 5<i>d.</i>, and sometimes but 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>, but 5<i>d.</i> may
be taken as an average.</p>

<p>Now 1,000,000 bushels of soot, at 5<i>d.</i>, will be
found to yield 20,833<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per annum. But
the whole of this quantity is not collected by the
chimney-sweepers, for many of the poorer persons
seldom have their chimneys swept; and by the
table given in another place, it will be seen that
not more than 800,000 bushels are obtained in
the course of the year by the London “sweeps.”
Hence we may say, that there are 800,000
bushels of soot annually collected from the London
chimneys, and that this is worth not less than
16,500<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The next question is, how many people are employed
in collecting this quantity of refuse matter</i>,
and how do they collect it, and what do they get,
individually and collectively, for so doing?</p>

<p>To begin with the number of master and
journeymen sweepers employed in removing these
800,000 bushels of soot from our chimneys:
according to the Census returns, the number of
“sweeps” in the metropolis in the years 1841
and 1831 were as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td></td><td class="total">1033</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>But these returns, such as they are, include
both employers and employed, in one confused
mass. To disentangle the economical knot, we must
endeavour to separate the number of master
sweepers from the journeymen. According to the
Post-Office Directory the master sweepers amount
to no more than 32, and thus there would be one
more than 1000 for the number of the metropolitan
journeymen sweepers; these statements, however,
appear to be very wide of the truth.</p>

<p>In 1816 it was represented to the House of
Commons, that there were within the bills of
mortality, 200 masters, all&mdash;except the “great
gentlemen,” as one witness described them, who
were about 20 in number&mdash;themselves working at
the business, and that they had 150 journeymen
and upwards of 500 apprentices, so that there
must then have been 850 working sweepers altogether,
young and old.</p>

<p>These numbers, it must be borne in mind, were
comprised in the limits of the bills of mortality
34 years ago. The parishes in the old bills of
mortality were 148; there are now in the metropolis
proper 176, and, as a whole, the area is
much more densely covered with dwelling-houses.
Taking but the last ten years, 1841 to 1851, the
inhabited houses have increased from 262,737 to
307,722, or, in round numbers, 45,000.</p>

<p>Now in 1811 the number of inhabited houses
in the metropolis was 146,019, and in 1821 it
was 164,948; hence in 1816 we may assume
the inhabited houses to have been about 155,000;
and since this number required 850 working
sweepers to cleanse the London chimneys, it is
but a rule of three sum to find how many would
have been required for the same purpose in 1841,
when the inhabited houses had increased to
262,737; this, according to Cocker, is about
1400; so that we must come to the conclusion
either that the number of working sweepers had
not kept pace with the increase of houses, or
that the returns of the census were as defective
in this respect as we have found them to be concerning
the street-sellers, dustmen, and scavagers.
Were we to pursue the same mode of calculation,
we should find that if 850 sweepers were required
to cleanse the chimneys of 155,000 houses, there
should be 1687 such labourers in London now
that the houses are 307,722 in number.</p>

<p>But it will be seen that in 1816 more than one-half
(or 500 out of 850) of the working chimney-sweepers
were apprentices, and in 1841 the
chimney-sweepers under 20 years of age, if we
are to believe the census, constituted more than
one-third of the whole body (or 370 out of 1033).
Now as the use of climbing boys was prohibited
in 1842, of course this large proportion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
trade has been rendered useless; so that, estimating
the master and journeymen sweepers at 250 in
1816, it would appear that about 500 would be
required to sweep the chimneys of the metropolis
at present. To these, of course, must be added
the extra number of journeymen necessary for
managing the machines. And considering the
journeymen to have increased threefold since the
abolition of the climbing boys, we must add 300
to the above number, which will make the sum
total of the individuals employed in this trade to
amount to very nearly 800.</p>

<p>By inquiries throughout the several districts of
the metropolis, I find that there are altogether 350
master sweepers at present in London; 106 of
these are large masters, who seldom go out on a
round, but work to order, having a regular custom
among the more wealthy classes; while the other
244 consist of 92 small masters and 152 “single-handed”
masters, who travel on various rounds,
both in London and the suburbs, seeking custom.
Of the whole number, 19 reside within the City
boundaries; from 90 to 100 live on the Surrey
side, and 235 on the Middlesex side of the
Thames (without the City boundaries). A large
master employs from 2 to 10 men, and 2 boys;
and a small one only 2 men or sometimes 1 man
and a boy, while a single-handed master employs
no men nor boys at all, but does all the work himself.</p>

<p>The 198 masters employ among them 12 foremen,
399 journeymen, and 62 boys, or 473
hands, and adding to them the single-handed
master-men who work at the business themselves,
we have 823 working men in all; so that, on the
whole, there are not less than between 800 and
900 persons employed in cleansing the London
chimneys of their soot.</p>

<p>The next point that presents itself in due order
to the mind is, as to the <i>mode of working among
the chimney-sweepers</i>; that is to say, how are the
800,000 bushels of soot collected from the 300,000
houses by these 820 working sweepers? But this
involves a short history of the trade.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sweepers of Old, and the Climbing
Boys.</span></h3>

<p>Formerly the chimneys used to be cleansed by
the house servants, for a person could easily stand
erect in the huge old-fashioned constructions, and
thrust up a broom as far as his strength would
permit. Sometimes, however, straw was kindled
at the mouth of the chimney, and in that way
the soot was consumed or brought down to the
ground by the action of the fire. But that there
were also regular chimney-sweepers in the latter
part of the sixteenth century is unquestionable;
for in the days of the First James and Charles,
poor Piedmontese, and more especially Savoyards,
resorted to England for the express purpose.
How long they laboured in this vocation is unknown.
The Savoyards, indeed, were then the
general showmen and sweeps of Europe, and so
they are still in some of the cities of Italy and
France.</p>

<p>As regards the first introduction of English
children into chimneys&mdash;the establishment of the
use of climbing boys&mdash;nothing appears, according
to the representations made to Parliament on
several occasions, to be known; and little attention
seems to have been paid to the condition of
these infants&mdash;some were but little better&mdash;until
about 1780, when the benevolent Jonas Hanway,
who is said, but not uncontradictedly,
to have been the first person who regularly used
an umbrella in the streets of London, called public
attention to the matter. In 1788 Mr. Hanway
and others brought a bill into Parliament for the
better protection of the climbing boys, requiring,
among other provisions, all master sweepers to be
licensed, and the names and ages of all their
apprentices registered. The House of Lords,
however, rejected this bill, and the 28th George
III., c. 48, was passed in preference. The chief
alterations sought to be effected by the new Act
were, that no sweeper should have more than six
apprentices, and that no boy should be apprenticed
at a tenderer age than eight years. Previously
there were no restrictions in either of
those respects.</p>

<p>These provisions were, however, very generally
violated. By one of those “flaws” or omissions,
so very common and so little creditable to our
legislation, it was found that there was no prohibition
to a sweeper’s employing his own children at
what age he pleased; and “some,” or “several,”
for I find both words used, employed their sons,
and occasionally their daughters, in chimney
climbing at the ages of six, five, and even between
four and five years! The children of others, too,
were continually being apprenticed at illegal ages,
for no inquiry was made into the lad’s age beyond
the statement of his parents, or, in the case of
parish apprentices, beyond the (in those days) not
more trustworthy word of the overseers. Thus
boys of six were apprenticed&mdash;for apprenticeship
was almost universal&mdash;as boys of eight, by their
parents; while parish officers and magistrates
consigned the workhouse orphans, as a thing of
course, to the starvation and tyranny which they
must have known were very often in store for
them when apprenticed to sweepers.</p>

<p>The following evidence was adduced before Parliament
on the subject of infant labour in this
<span class="lock">trade:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. John Cook, a master sweeper, then of
Great Windmill-street and Kentish-town, the first
who persevered in the use of the machine years
before its use was compulsory, stated that it was
common for parents in the business to employ
their own children, under the age of seven, in
climbing; and that as far as he knew, he himself
was only between six and seven when he “came
to it;” and that almost all master sweepers had got
it in their bills that they kept “small boys for
register-stoves, and such like as that.”</p>

<p>Mr. T. Allen, another master sweeper, was between
four and five when articled to an uncle.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE LONDON SWEEP</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. B. M. Forster, a private gentleman, a member
of the “Committee to promote the Superseding
of Climbing Boys,” said, “Some are put to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
employment very young; one instance of which
occurred to a child in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch,
who was put to the trade at four and a
quarter years, or thereabouts. The father of a
child in Whitechapel told me last week, that his
son began climbing when he was four years and
eight months old. I have heard of some still
younger, but only from vague report.”</p>

<p>This sufficiently proves at what infantine years
children were exposed to toils of exceeding painfulness.
The smaller and the more slenderly
formed the child, the more valuable was he for
the sweeping of flues, the interior of some of
them, to be ascended and swept, being but seven
inches square.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the employment of female
children in the very unsuitable labour of climbing
chimneys. The following is all the information
given on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Tooke was asked, “Have you ever heard
of female children being so employed?” and
replied, “I have heard of cases at Hadley, Barnet,
Windsor, and Uxbridge; and I know a case
at Witham, near Colchester, of that sort.”</p>

<p>Mr. B. M. Foster said, “Another circumstance,
which has not been mentioned to the Committee,
is, that there are several little girls employed;
there are two of the name of Morgan at Windsor,
daughters of the chimney-sweeper <i>who is employed
to sweep the chimneys of the Castle</i>; another
instance at Uxbridge, and at Brighton, and
at Whitechapel (which was some years ago), and
at Headley near Barnet, and Witham in Essex,
and elsewhere.” He then stated, on being asked,
“Do you not think that girls were employed
from their physical form being smaller and
thinner than boys, and therefore could get up
narrower flues?” “The reason that I have understood
was, because their parents had not a sufficient
number of boys to bring up to the business.”
Mr. Foster did not know the ages of these girls.</p>

<p>The inquiry by a Committee of the House of
Commons, which led more than any other to the
prohibition of this infant and yet painful labour
in chimney-sweeping, was held in 1817, and they
recommended the “preventing the further use of
climbing boys in sweeping of chimneys;” a recommendation
not carried into effect until 1832.
The matter was during the interval frequently
agitated in Parliament, but there were no later
investigations by Committees.</p>

<p>I will adduce, specifically, the grievances, according
to the Report of 1817, of the climbing
boys; but will first present the following extract
from the evidence of Mr. W. Tooke, a gentleman
who, in accordance with the Hon. Henry Grey
Bennet, M.P., and others, exerted himself on the
behoof of the climbing boys. When he gave his
evidence, Mr. Tooke was the secretary to a society
whose object was to supersede the necessity of
employing climbing boys. He <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In the year 1800, the Society for Bettering
the Condition of the Poor took up the subject, but
little or nothing appears to have been done upon
that occasion, except that the most respectable
master chimney-sweepers entered into an association
and subscription for promoting the cleanliness
and health of the boys in their respective services.
The Institution of which I am treasurer, and
which is now existing, was formed in February,
1803. In consequence of an anonymous advertisement,
a large meeting was held at the London
Coffee House, and the Society was established;
immediate steps were then taken to ascertain the
state of the trade; inspectors were appointed
to give an account of all the master chimney-sweepers
within the bills of mortality, their
general character, their conduct towards their
apprentices, and the number of those apprentices.
It was ascertained, that the total number of
master chimney-sweepers, within the bills of
mortality, might be estimated at 200, who had
among them 500 apprentices; that not above 20
of those masters were reputable tradesmen in easy
circumstances, who appeared generally to conform
to the provisions of the Act; and which 20 had,
upon an average, from four to five apprentices
each. We found about 90 of an inferior class of
master chimney-sweepers who averaged three
apprentices each, and who were extremely negligent
both of the health, morals, and education of
those apprentices; and about 90, the remainder
of the 200 masters, were a class of chimney-sweepers
recently journeymen, who took up the
trade because they had no other resource; they
picked up boys as they could, who lodged with
themselves in huts, sheds, and cellars, in the outskirts
of the town, occasionally wandering into
the villages round, where they slept on soot-bags,
and lived in the grossest filth.”</p>

<p>The grievances I have spoken of were thus
summed up by the Parliamentary Committee.
After referring to the ill-usage and hardships sustained
by the climbing boys (the figures being
now introduced for the sake of distinctness) it is
<span class="lock">stated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It is in evidence that (1) they are stolen
from” [and sold by] “their parents, and inveigled
out of workhouses; (2) that in order to
conquer the natural repugnance of the infants to
ascend the narrow and dangerous chimneys to
clean which their labour is required, blows are
used; that pins are forced into their feet by the
boy that follows them up the chimney, in order
to compel them to ascend it, and that lighted
straw has been applied for that purpose; (3) that
the children are subject to sores and bruises, and
wounds and burns on their thighs, knees, and
elbows; and that it will require many months
before the extremities of the elbows and knees
become sufficiently hard to resist the excoriations
to which they are at first subject.”</p>

<p>1. With regard to the <i>stealing or kidnapping
of children</i>&mdash;for there was often a difficulty
in procuring climbing boys&mdash;I find mention in
the evidence, as of a matter, but not a very
frequent matter, of notoriety. One stolen child
was sold to a master sweeper for 8<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> Mr. G.
Revely <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I wish to state to the Committee that case in
particular, because it comes home to the better
sort of persons in higher life. It seems that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
child, upon being asked various questions, had been
taken away: the child was questioned how he
came into that situation; he said all that he could
recollect was (as I heard it told at that time) that
he and his sister, with another brother, were together
somewhere, but he could not tell where; but
not being able to run so well as the other two,
he was caught by a woman and carried away
and was sold, and came afterwards into the hands
of a chimney-sweeper. He was not afterwards
restored to his family, and the mystery was never
unravelled; but he was advertised, and a lady
took charge of him.</p>

<p>“This child, in 1804, was forced up a chimney
at Bridlington in Yorkshire, by a big boy, the
younger boy being apparently but four years old.
He fell and bruised his legs terribly against the
grate. The Misses Auckland of Boynton, who had
heard of the child, and went to see him, became
interested by his manners, and they took him home
with them; the chimney-sweeper, who perhaps got
alarmed, being glad to part with him. Soon after
he got to Boynton, the seat of Sir George Strickland,
a plate with something to eat was brought him; on
seeing a silver fork he was quite delighted, and
said, ‘Papa had such forks as those.’ He also
said the carpet in the drawing-room was like
papa’s; the housekeeper showed him a silver
watch, he asked what sort it was&mdash;‘Papa’s was a
gold watch;’ he then pressed the handle and said,
‘Papa’s watch rings, why does not yours?’ Sir
George Strickland, on being told this circumstance,
showed him a gold repeater, the little boy
pressed the spring, and when it struck, he jumped
about the room, saying, ‘Papa’s watch rings so.’
At night, when he was going to bed, he said he
could not go to bed until he had said his prayers;
he then repeated the Lord’s Prayer, almost perfectly.
The account he gave of himself was that
he was gathering flowers in his mamma’s garden,
and that the woman who sold him to the sweeper,
came in and asked him if he liked riding? He
said, ‘Yes,’ and she told him he should ride with
her. She put him on a horse, after which they got
into a vessel, and the sails were put up, ‘and away
we went.’ He had no recollection of his name, or
where he lived, and was too young to think his
father could have any other name than that of
papa. He started whenever he heard a servant
in the family at Boynton called George, and
looked as if he expected to see somebody he
knew; on inquiry, he said he had an uncle
George, whom he loved dearly. He says his
mamma is dead, and it is thought his father may
be abroad. From many things he says, he seems
to have lived chiefly with an uncle and aunt,
whom he invariably says were called Mr. and
Mrs. Flembrough. From various circumstances,
it is thought impossible he should be the child of
the woman who sold him, his manners being ‘very
civilized,’ quite those of a child well educated;
his dialect is good, and that of the south of England.
This little boy, when first discovered, was
conjectured to be about four years old, and is
described as having beautiful black eyes and eye-lashes,
a high nose, and a delicate soft skin.”</p>

<p>Mr. J. Harding, a master sweeper, had a fellow
apprentice who had been enticed away from his
parents. “It is a case of common occurrence,” he
said, “for children stolen, to be employed in this
way. Yes, and children in particular are enticed
out of workhouses: there are a great many who
come out of workhouses.”</p>

<p>The following cases were also submitted to the
<span class="lock">Committee:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“A poor woman had been obliged by sickness
to go into an hospital, and while she was there her
child was stolen from her house, taken into Staffordshire,
and there apprenticed to a chimney-sweeper.
By some happy circumstance she learned
his fate; she followed him, and succeeded in
rescuing him from his forlorn situation. Another
child, who was an orphan, was tricked into following
the same wretched employment by a chimney-sweeper,
who gave him a shilling, and made him
believe that by receiving it he became his apprentice;
the poor boy, either discovering or suspecting
that he had been deceived, anxiously endeavoured
to speak to a magistrate who happened to come to
the house in which he was sweeping chimneys,
but his master watched him so closely that he
could not succeed. He at last contrived to tell his
story to a blind soldier, who determined to right
the poor boy, and by <i>great exertions</i> succeeded in
procuring him his liberty.”</p>

<p>It was in country places, however, that the
stealing and kidnapping of children was the most
frequent, and the threat of “the sweeps will get
you” was often held out, to deter children from
wandering. These stolen infants, it is stated,
were usually conveyed to some distance by the
vagrants who had secured them, and sold to some
master sweeper, being apprenticed as the child of
the vendors, for it was difficult for sweepers in thinly-peopled
places to get a supply of climbing boys.
It was shown about the time of the Parliamentary
inquiry, in the course of a trial at the Lancaster
assizes, that a boy had been apprenticed to a
sweeper by two travelling tinkers, man and
woman, who informed him that the child was
stolen from another “traveller,” 80 miles away,
who was “too fond of it to make it a sweep.”
The <i>price</i> of the child was not mentioned.</p>

<p>Respecting the sale of children to be apprentices
to sweepers, Mr. Tooke was able to state that,
although in 1816, the practice had very much
diminished of late, parents in many instances still
<i>sold their children for three, four, or five guineas</i>.
This sum was generally paid under the guise of
an apprentice fee, but it was known to be and
was called a “sale,” for the parents, real or
nominal, never interfered with the master subsequently,
but left the infant to its fate.</p>

<p>2. I find the following account of the <i>means
resorted to, in order to induce, or more frequently
compel, these wretched infants to work</i>.</p>

<p>The boy in the first instance went for a month,
or any term agreed upon, “on trial,” or “to see
how he would suit for the business.” During
this period of probation he was usually well
treated and well fed (whatever the character of
the master), with little to do beyond running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
errands, and observing the mode of work of the
experienced climbers. When, however, he was
“bound” as an apprentice, he was put with another
lad who had been for some time at the business.
The new boy was sent first up the chimney, and
immediately followed by the other, who instructed
him how to ascend. This was accomplished by
the pressure of the knees and the elbows against
the sides of the flue. By pressing the knees
tightly the child managed to raise his arms somewhat
higher, and then by pressing his elbows in
like manner he contrived to draw up his legs,
and so on. The inside of the flue presented a
smooth surface, and there were no inequalities
where the fingers or toes could be inserted.
Should the young beginner fall, he was sure to light
on the shoulders of the boy beneath him, who always
kept himself firmly fixed in expectation of such a
mishap, and then the novice had to commence
anew; in this manner the twain reached the
top by degrees, sweeping down the soot, and
descended by the same method. This practice
was very severe, especially on new boys, whose
knees and elbows were torn by the pressure and
the slipping down continually&mdash;the skin being
stripped off, and frequently breaking out in frightful
sores, from the constant abrasions, and from
the soot and dirt getting into them.</p>

<p>In his evidence before Parliament in 1817 (for
there had been previous inquiries), Mr. Cook
gave an account of the training of these boys, and
on being asked:&mdash;“Do the elbows and knees of
the boys, when they first begin the business,
become very sore, and afterwards get callous, and
are those boys employed in sweeping chimneys
during the soreness of those parts?” answered,
“It depends upon the sort of master they have
got; some are obliged to put them to work sooner
than others; you must keep them a little at it, or
they will never learn their business, even during
the sores.” He stated further, that the skin
broke generally, and that the boys could not
ascend chimneys during the sores without <i>very</i>
great pain. “The way that I learn boys is,” he
continued, “to put some cloths over their elbows
and over their knees till they get the nature of
the chimney&mdash;till they get a little used to it: we
call it <i>padding</i> them, and then we take them off,
and they get very little grazed indeed after they
have got the art; but very few will take that
trouble. Some boys’ flesh is far worse than others,
and it takes more time to harden them.” He was
then asked:&mdash;“Do those persons still continue to
employ them to climb chimneys?” and the
answer was: “Some do; it depends upon the
character of the master. None of them of that
class keep them till they get well; none. They
are obliged to climb with those sores upon them.
I never had one of my own apprentices do that.”
This system of padding, however, was but little
practised; but in what proportion it <i>was</i> practised,
unless by the respectable masters, who were
then but few in number, the Parliamentary papers,
the only information on the subject now attainable,
do not state. The inference is, that the
majority, out of but 20 of these masters, with
some 80 or 100 apprentices, did treat them well,
and what was so accounted. The customary way
of training these boys, then, was such as I have
described; some even of the better masters, whose
boys were in the comparison well lodged and fed,
and “sent to the Sunday school” (which seems
to have comprised all needful education), considered
“padding and such like” to be “new-fangled
nonsense.”</p>

<p>I may add also, that although the boy carried
up a brush with him, it was used but occasionally,
only when there were “turns” or defects in the
chimney, the soot being brought down by the action
of the shoulders and limbs. The climber
wore a cap to protect his eyes and mouth from
the soot, and a sort of flannel tunic, his feet, legs,
and arms being bare. Some of these lads were
surprisingly quick. One man told me that, when
in his prime as a climbing boy, he could reach the
top of a chimney about as quickly as a person
could go up stairs to the attics.</p>

<p>The following is from the evidence of Mr.
Cook, frequently cited as an excellent <span class="lock">master:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“What mode do you adopt to get the boy to go
up the chimney in the first instance?&mdash;We persuade
him as well as we can; we generally
practise him in one of our own chimneys first;
one of the boys who knows the trade goes up
behind him, and when he has practised it perhaps
ten times, though some will require twenty times,
they generally can manage it. The boy goes up
with him to keep him from falling; after that, the
boy will manage to go up with himself, after going
up and down several times with one under him:
we do this, because if he happens to make a slip
he will be caught by the other.</p>

<p>“Do you find many boys show repugnance to
go up at first?&mdash;Yes, most of them.</p>

<p>“And if they resist and reject, in what way do
you force them up?&mdash;By telling them we must
take them back again to their father and mother,
and give them up again; and their parents are
generally people who cannot maintain them.</p>

<p>“So that they are afraid of going back to their
parents for fear of being starved?&mdash;Yes; they go
through a deal of hardship before they come to
our trade.</p>

<p>“Did you use any more violent means?&mdash;Sometimes
a rod.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of straw being lighted
under them?&mdash;Never.</p>

<p>“You never heard of any means being made use
of, except being beat and being sent home?&mdash;No;
no other.</p>

<p>“You are aware, of course, that those means
being gentle or harsh must depend very much upon
the character of the individual master?&mdash;It does.</p>

<p>“Of course you must know that there are persons
of harsh and cruel disposition; have you not
often heard of masters treating their apprentices
with great cruelty, particularly the little boys, in
forcing them to go up those small flues, which the
boys were unwilling to ascend?&mdash;Yes; I have
forced up many a one myself.</p>

<p>“By what means?&mdash;By threatenings, and by
giving them a kick or a slap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>It was also stated that the journeymen used
the boys with greater cruelty than did the masters&mdash;indeed
a delegated tyranny is often the worst&mdash;that
for very little faults they kicked and slapped
the children, and sometimes flogged them with a
cat, “made of rope, hard at each end, and as
thick as your thumb.”</p>

<p>Mr. John Fisher, a master chimney-sweeper,
said:&mdash;“Many masters, are very severe with their
children. To make them go up the chimneys I
have seen them make them strip themselves
naked; I have been obliged myself to go up a
chimney naked.”</p>

<p>As respects the cruelties of driving boys up
chimneys by kindling straw beneath their feet, or
thrusting pins into the soles of their feet, I find
the following statements given on the authority of
B. M. Forster, Esq., a private gentleman residing
in <span class="lock">Walthamstow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“A lad was ordered to sweep a chimney at
Wandsworth; he came down after endeavouring
to ascend, and this occurred several times before
he gave up the point; at last the journeyman took
some straw or hay, and lighted it under him to
drive him up: when he endeavoured to get up the
last time, he found there was a bar across the
chimney, which he could not pass; he was obliged
in consequence to come down, and the journeyman
beat him so cruelly, to use his own expression,
that he could not stand for a fortnight.</p>

<p>“In the whole city of Norwich I could find
only nine climbing boys, two of whom I questioned
on many particulars; one was with respect to the
manner in which they are taught to climb; they
both agreed in that particular, that a larger boy
was sent up behind them to prick their feet, if
they did not climb properly. I purposely avoided
mentioning about pricking them with pins, but
asked them how they did it; they said that they
thrust the pins into the soles of their feet. A
third instance occurred at Walthamstow; a man
told me that some he knew had been taught in
the same way; I believe it to be common, but I
cannot state any more instances from authority.”</p>

<p>3. On the subject of the <i>sores, bruises, wounds,
burns, and diseases</i>, to which chimney-sweepers in
their apprenticeships were not only exposed, but,
as it were, condemned, Mr. R. Wright, a surgeon,
on being examined before the Committee,
said, “I shall begin with <i>Deformity</i>. I am well persuaded
that the deformity of the spine, legs, arms,
&amp;c., of chimney-sweepers, generally, if not wholly,
proceeds from the circumstance of their being
obliged not only to go up chimneys at an age
when their bones are in a soft and growing state,
but likewise from their being compelled by their
too merciless masters and mistresses to carry bags
of soot (and those very frequently for a great
length of distance and time) by far too heavy for
their tender years and limbs. The knees and
ancle joints mostly become deformed, in the first
instance, from the position they are obliged to
put them in, in order to support themselves, not
only while climbing up the chimney, but more
particularly so in that of coming down, when they
rest solely on the lower extremities.</p>

<p>“<i>Sore eyes and eyelids</i>, are the next to be considered.
Chimney-sweepers are very subject to
inflammation of the eyelids, and not unfrequently
weakness of sight, in consequence of such inflammation.
This I attribute to the circumstance of
the soot lodging on the eyelids, which first produces
irritability of the part, and the constantly
rubbing them with their dirty hands, instead of
alleviating, increases the disease; for I have observed
in a number of cases, when the patient has
ceased for a time to follow the business, and of
course the original cause has been removed, that
with washing and keeping clean they were soon
got well.</p>

<p>“<i>Sores</i>, for the same reasons, are generally a
long time in healing.</p>

<p>“<i>Cancer</i> is another and a most formidable disease,
which chimney-sweepers in particular are
liable to, especially that of the scrotum; from
which circumstance, by way of distinction, it is
called the ‘chimney-sweeper’s cancer.’ Of this
sort of cancer I have seen several instances, some
of which have been operated on; but, in general,
they are apt to let them go too far before they
apply for relief. Cancers of the lips are not so
general as cancers of the scrotum. I never saw
but two instances of the former, and several of the
latter.”</p>

<p>The “chimney-sweep’s cancer” was always
lectured upon as a separate disease at Guy’s and
Bartholomew’s Hospitals, and on the question
being put to Mr. Wright: “Do the physicians
who are intrusted with the care and management
of those hospitals think that disease of
such common occurrence, that it is necessary to
make it a part of surgical education?”&mdash;he replied:
“Most assuredly; I remember Mr. Cline and
Mr. Cooper were particular on that subject; and
having one or two cases of the kind in the hospital,
it struck my mind very forcibly. With the
permission of the Committee I will relate a case
that occurred lately, which I had from one of the
pupils of St. Thomas’s Hospital; he informed me
that they recently had a case of a chimney-sweeper’s
cancer, which was to have been operated
on that week, but the man ‘brushed’ (to use their
expression) or rather walked off; he would not
submit to the operation: similar instances of which
I have known myself. They dread so much the
knife, in consequence of foolish persons telling
them it is so formidable an operation, and that
they will die under it. I conceive without the
operation it is death; for cancers are of that
nature that unless you extricate them entirely they
will never be cured.”</p>

<p>Of the chimney-sweeper’s cancer, the following
statement is given in the Report: “Mr. Cline
informed your Committee by letter, that this disease
is rarely seen in any other persons than
chimney-sweepers, and in them cannot be considered
as frequent; for during his practice in St.
Thomas’s hospital, for more than 40 years, the
number of those could not exceed 20. But your
Committee have been informed that the dread of
the operation which it is necessary to perform,
deters many from submitting to it; and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
evidence of persons engaged in the trade, it appears
to be much more common than Mr. Cline seems to
be aware of.</p>

<p>“<i>Cough and Asthma.</i>&mdash;Chimney-sweepers are,
from their being out at all hours and in all
weathers, very liable to cough and inflammation
of the chest.</p>

<p>“<i>Burns.</i>&mdash;They are very subject to burns, from
their being forced up chimneys while on fire, or
soon after they have been on fire, and while over-heated;
and however they may cry out, their inhuman
masters pay not the least attention, but
compel them, too often with horrid imprecations,
to proceed.</p>

<p>“<i>Stunted growth</i>, in this unfortunate race of the
community, is attributed, in a great measure, to
their being brought into the business at a very
early age.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To <i>accidents</i> they were frequently liable in the
pursuit of their callings, and sometimes these
accidents were the being jammed or fixed, or, as
it was called in the trade, “stuck,” in narrow and
heated flues, sometimes for hours, and until death.</p>

<p>Among these hapless lads were indeed many
deaths from accidents, cruelty, privation, and exhaustion,
but it does not appear that the number
was ever ascertained. There were also many
narrow escapes from dreadful deaths. I give instances
of <span class="lock">each:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“On Monday morning, the 29th of March,
1813, a chimney-sweeper of the name of Griggs,
attended to sweep a small chimney in the brewhouse
of Messrs. Calvert and Co., in Upper
Thames-street; he was accompanied by one of his
boys, a lad of about eight years of age, of the
name of Thomas Pitt. The fire had been lighted
as early as two o’clock the same morning, and was
burning on the arrival of Griggs and his little
boy at eight; the fire-place was small, and an
iron pipe projected from the grate some little distance,
into the flue; this the master was acquainted
with (having swept the chimneys in the
brewhouse for some years) and therefore had a tile
or two taken from the roof, in order that the
boy might descend the chimney. He had no
sooner extinguished the fire than he suffered the
lad to go down; and the consequence, as might be
expected, was his almost immediate death, in a
state, no doubt, of inexpressible agony. The flue
was of the narrowest description, and must have
retained heat sufficient to have prevented the
child’s return to the top, even supposing he had
not approached the pipe belonging to the grate,
which must have been nearly red-hot; this, however,
was not clearly ascertained on the inquest,
though the appearance of the body would induce
an opinion that he had been unavoidably pressed
against the pipe. Soon after his descent, the
master, who remained on the top, was apprehensive
that something had happened, and therefore
desired him to come up; the answer of the boy
was, ‘I cannot come up, master; I must die here.’
An alarm was given in the brewhouse, immediately,
that he had stuck in the chimney, and a
bricklayer who was at work near the spot attended,
and after knocking down part of the brickwork
of the chimney, just above the fire-place,
made a hole sufficiently large to draw him through.
A surgeon attended, but all attempts to restore
life were ineffectual. On inspecting the body,
various burns appeared; the fleshy part of the
legs, and a great part of the feet more particularly,
were injured; those parts, too, by which climbing
boys most effectually ascend or descend chimneys,
viz., the elbows and knees, seemed burnt to the
bone; from which it must be evident that the
unhappy sufferer made some attempts to return as
soon as the horrors of his situation became apparent.”</p>

<p>“In the improvement made some years since
by the Bank of England, in Lothbury, a chimney,
belonging to a Mr. Mildrum, a baker, was taken
down, but before he began to bake, in order to
see that the rest of the flue was clear, a boy was
sent up, and after remaining some time, and not
answering to the call of his master, another boy
was ordered to descend from the top of the flue
and to meet him half-way; but this being found
impracticable, they opened the brickwork in the
lower part of the flue, and found the first-mentioned
boy dead. In the mean time the boy in the
upper part of the flue called out for relief, saying,
he was completely jammed in the rubbish and
was unable to extricate himself. Upon this a
bricklayer was employed with the utmost expedition,
but he succeeded only in obtaining a lifeless
body. The bodies were sent to St. Margaret’s
Church, Lothbury, and a coroner’s inquest, which
sat upon them, returned the verdict&mdash;Accidental
Death.”</p>

<p>“In the beginning of the year 1808, a chimney-sweeper’s
boy being employed to sweep a chimney
in Marsh-street, Walthamstow, in the house of
Mr. Jeffery, carpenter, unfortunately, in his attempt
to get down, stuck in the flue and was
unable to extricate himself. Mr. Jeffery, being
within hearing of the boy, immediately procured
assistance. As the chimney was low, and the top
of it easily accessible from without, the boy was
taken out in about ten minutes, the chimney-pot
and several rows of bricks having been previously
removed; if he had remained in that dreadful
situation many minutes longer, he must have
died. His master was sent for, and he arrived
soon after the boy had been released; he abused
him for the accident, and, after striking him, sent
him with a bag of soot to sweep another chimney.
The child appeared so very weak when taken out
that he could scarcely stand, and yet this wretched
being, who had been up ever since three o’clock,
had before been sent by his master to Wanstead,
which with his walk to Marsh-street made about
five miles.”</p>

<p>“In May, 1817, a boy employed in sweeping a
chimney in Sheffield got wedged fast in one of
the flues, and remained in that situation near two
hours before he could be extricated, which was at
length accomplished by pulling down part of the
chimney.”</p>

<p>On one occasion a child remained above two
hours in some danger in a chimney, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
venture down and encounter his master’s anger.
The man was held to bail, which he could not
procure.</p>

<p>As in the cases I have described (at Messrs.
Calvert’s, and in Lothbury), the verdict was
usually “Accidental Death,” or something equivalent.</p>

<p>It was otherwise, however, where wilful cruelty
was proven.</p>

<p>The following case was a subject of frequent
comment at the <span class="lock">time:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“On Friday, 31st May, 1816, William Moles
and Sarah his wife, were tried at the Old Bailey
for the wilful murder of John Hewley, alias
Haseley, a boy about six years of age, in the
month of April last, by cruelly beating him.
Under the direction of the learned judge, they
were acquitted of the crime of murder, but the
husband was detained to take his trial as for a
misdemeanor, of which he was convicted upon the
fullest evidence, and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.
The facts, as proved in this case, are
too shocking in detail to relate: the substance of
them is, that he was forced up the chimney on the
shoulder of a bigger boy, and afterwards violently
pulled down again by the leg and dashed upon a
marble hearth; his leg was thus broken, and
death ensued in a few hours, and on his body and
knees were found scars arising from wounds of a
much older date.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This long-continued system of cruelties, of violations
of public and private duties, bore and
ripened its natural fruits. The climbing boys
grew up to be unhealthy, vicious, ignorant, and
idle men, for during their apprenticeships their
labour was over early in the day, and they often
passed away their leisure in gambling in the
streets with one another and other children of
their stamp, as they frequently had halfpence given
to them. They played also at “chuck and toss”
with the journeymen, and of course were stripped
of every farthing. Thus they became indolent
and fond of excitement. When a lad ceased to
be an apprentice, although he might be but 16, he
was too big to climb, and even if he got employment
as a journeyman, his remuneration was
wretched, only 2<i>s.</i> a week, with his board and
lodging. There were, however, far fewer complaints
of being insufficiently fed than might have
been expected, but the sleeping places were execrable:
“They sleep in different places,” it was
stated, “sometimes in sheds, and sometimes in
places which we call barracks (large rooms), or in
the cellar (where the soot was kept); some never
sleep upon anything that can be called a bed;
some do.”</p>

<p>Mr. T. Allen, a master sweep for 22 years, gave
the Committee the following account of <i>the men’s
earnings and</i> (what may be called) <i>the General
Perquisites of the trade</i> under the exploded
<span class="lock">system:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“If a man be 25 years of age, he has no more
than 2<i>s.</i> a week; he is not clothed, only fed and
lodged in the same manner as the boys. The 2<i>s.</i>
a week is not sufficient to find him clothes and
other necessaries, certainly not; it is hardly
enough to find him with shoe-leather, for they
walk over a deal of ground in going about the
streets. The journeyman is able to live upon those
wages, for he gets halfpence given him: supposing
he is 16 or 20 years of age, he gets the boys’ pence
from them and keeps it; and if he happens to get
a job for which he receives a 1<i>s.</i>, he gets 6<i>d.</i> of
that, and his master the other 6<i>d.</i> The boys’ pence
are what the boys get after they have been doing
their master’s work; they get a 1<i>d.</i> or so, and the
journeyman takes it from them, and ‘licks’ them
if they do not give it up.” [These “jobs,” after
the master’s work had been done, were chance
jobs, as when a journeyman on his round was
called on by a stranger, and unexpectedly, to
sweep a chimney. Sometimes, by arrangement of
the journeyman and the lad, the proceeds never
reached the master’s pocket. Sometimes, but
rarely, such jobs were the journeyman’s rightful
perquisite.] “Men,” proceeds Mr. Allen, “who
are 22 and 23 years of age will play with the
young boys and win their money. That is, they
get half the money from them by force, and the
rest by fraud. They are driven to this course
from the low wages which the masters give them,
because they have no other means to get anything
for themselves, not even the few necessaries which
they may want; for even what they want to wash
with they must get themselves. As to what becomes
of the money the boys get on May-day,
when they are in want of clothes, the master will
buy them, as check shirts or handkerchiefs. These
masters get a share of the money which the boys
collect on May-day. The boys have about 1<i>s.</i> or
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; the journeyman has also his share; then
the master takes the remainder, which is to buy
the boys’ clothes and other necessaries, as they say.
I cannot exactly tell what the average amount is
that a boy will get on the May-day; the most
that my boy ever got was 5<i>s.</i> But I think that
the boys get more than that; I should think they
get as much as 9<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i> apiece. The Christmas-boxes
are generally, I believe, divided among
themselves (among the boys); but I cannot say
rightly. It is spent in buying silk handkerchiefs,
or Sunday shoes, I believe; but I am not perfectly
sure.”</p>

<p>Of the condition and lot of the operatives who
were too big to go up chimneys, Mr. J. Fisher, a
master-sweeper, gave the following account:&mdash;“<i>They
get into a roving way, and go about from
one master to another, and they often come to no
good end at last</i>. They sometimes go into the
country, and after staying there some time, they
come back again; I took a boy of that sort
very lately and kept him like my own, and let
him go to school; he asked me one Sunday to let
him go to school, and I was glad to let him go,
and I gave him leave; he accordingly went, and I
have seen nothing of him since; before he went
he asked me if I would let him come home to see
my child buried; I told him to ask his school-master,
but he did not come back again. I cannot
tell what has become of him; he was to have
served me for twelve months. I did not take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
from the parish; he came to me. He said his
parents were dead. <i>The effect of the roving habit
of the large boys when they become too large to
climb, is, that they get one with another and learn
bad habits from one another; they never will stop
long in any one place.</i> They frequently go into
the country and get various places; perhaps they
stop a month at each; some try to get masters
themselves, and some will get into bad company,
which very often happens. <i>Then they turn thieves,
they get lazy, they won’t work, and people do not
like to employ them lest they should take anything
out of their houses. The generality of them never
settle in any steady business.</i> They generally
turn loose characters, and people will not employ
them lest they should take anything out of
the house.”</p>

<p>The criminal annals of the kingdom bear out
the foregoing account. Some of these boys, indeed,
when they attained man’s estate, became, in a
great measure, through their skill in climbing,
expert and enterprising burglars, breaking into
places where few men would have cared to venture.
One of the most daring feats ever attempted
and accomplished was the escape from
Newgate by a sweeper about 15 years ago. He
climbed by the aid of his knees and elbows a
height of nearly 80 feet, though the walls, in the
corner of the prison-yard, where this was done,
were nearly of an even surface; the slightest slip
could not have failed to have precipitated the sweeper
to the bottom. He was then under sentence of
death for highway robbery.</p>

<p>“His name was Whitehead, and he done a
more wonderfuller thing nor that,” remarked an
informant, who had been his master. “We was
sweeping the bilers in a sugar-house, and he went
from the biler up the flue of the chimney, it was
nearly as high as the Monument, that chimney; I
should say it was 30 or 40 feet higher nor the
sugar-house. He got out at the top, and slid
down the bare brickwork on the outside, on to
the roof of the house, got through an attic window
in the roof, and managed to get off without any
one knowing what became of him. That was the
most wonderfullest thing I ever knowed in my life.
I don’t know how he escaped from being killed, but
he was always an oudacious feller. It was nearly
three months after afore we found him in the
country. I don’t know where they sent him to
after he was brought back to Newgate, but I hear
they made him a turnkey in a prison somewhere,
and that he’s doing very well now.” The feat at
the sugar-house could be only to escape from his
apprenticeship.</p>

<p>In the course of the whole Parliamentary
evidence the sweepers, reared under the old
climbing system, are spoken of as a “short-lived”
race, but no statistics could be given. Some died
old men in middle age, in the workhouses.
<i>Many were mere vagrants at the time of their
death.</i></p>

<p>I took the statement of a man who had been
what he called a “climbing” in his childhood,
but as he is now a master-sweeper, and has indeed
gone through all grades of the business, I shall
give it in my account of the present condition of
the sweepers.</p>

<p>Climbing is still occasionally resorted to, especially
when repairs are required, “but the climbing
boys,” I was told, “are now men.” These
are slight dwarfish men, whose services are often
in considerable request, and cannot at all times be
commanded, as there are only about twenty of
them in London, so effectually has climbing been
suppressed. These little men, I was told, did
pretty well, not unfrequently getting 2<i>s.</i> or
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a single job.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>labour question</i>, during the existence
of the climbing boys, we find in the Report
the following <span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>nominal</i> wages to the journeymen were
2<i>s.</i> a week, with board and lodging. The apprentices
received no wages, their masters being only
required to feed, lodge, and clothe them.</p>

<p>The <i>actual</i> wages were the same as the nominal,
with the addition of 1<i>s.</i> as perquisites in money.
There were other perquisites in liquor or broken
meat.</p>

<p>In the Reports are no accounts of the duration
of labour throughout the year, nor can I obtain
from master-sweepers, who were in the business
during the old mode, any sufficient data upon
which to found any calculations. The employment,
however, seems to have been generally <i>continuous</i>,
running through the year, though in the
course of the twelvemonth one master would have
four and another six different journeymen, but
only one at a time. The vagrant propensities of
the class is a means of accounting for this.</p>

<p>The <i>nominal</i> wages of those journeymen who
resided in their own apartments were generally
14<i>s.</i> a week, and their <i>actual</i> about 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> extra
in the form of perquisites. Others resided “on
the premises,” having the care of the boys, with
board and lodgings and 5<i>s.</i> a week in money
<i>nominally</i>, and 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>actually</i>, the perquisites
being worth 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Concerning the <i>general</i> or average wages of the
whole trade, I can only present the following computation.</p>

<p>Mr. Tooke, in his evidence before the House
of Commons, stated that the Committee, of which
he was a member, had ascertained that one boy
on an average swept about four chimneys daily, at
prices varying from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or a medium
return of about 10<i>d.</i> per chimney, exclusive of
the soot, then worth 8<i>d.</i> or 9<i>d.</i> a bushel. “It
appears,” he said, “from a datum I have here,
that those chimney-sweepers who keep six boys
(the greatest number allowed by law) gain, on an
average, nearly 270<i>l.</i>; five boys, 225<i>l.</i>; four
boys, 180<i>l.</i>; three boys, 135<i>l.</i>; two boys, 90<i>l.</i>;
and one boy 45<i>l.</i> (yearly), exclusive of the soot,
which is, I should suppose, upon an average, from
half a bushel to a bushel every time the chimney
is swept.”</p>

<p>“Out of the profits you mention,” he was then
asked, “the master has to maintain the boys?”&mdash;“Yes,”
was the answer, “and when the expenses
of house and cellar rent, and the wages of journeymen,
and the maintenance of apprentices, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
taken into the account, the number of master
chimney-sweepers is not only more than the trade
will support, but exceeds, by above one-third,
what the public exigency requires. The Committee
also ascertained that the 200 master
chimney-sweepers in the metropolis were supposed
to have in their employment 150 journeymen
and 500 boys.”</p>

<p>The matter may be reduced to a tabular form,
expressing the amount in money&mdash;for it is not
asserted that the masters generally gained on the
charge for their journeymen’s board and lodging&mdash;as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This yielded, then, according to the information
submitted to the House of Commons Select
Committee, as the profits of the trade prior to
1817, an individual yearly gain to each master
sweeper of 128<i>l.</i>; but, taking Mr. Tooke’s average
yearly profit for the six classes of tradesmen,
270<i>l.</i>, 225<i>l.</i>, 180<i>l.</i>, 135<i>l.</i>, 90<i>l.</i>, and 45<i>l.</i> respectively,
the individual profit averages above 157<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The capital, I am informed, would not average
above two guineas per master sweeper, nothing
being wanted beyond a few common sacks, made
by the sweepers’ wives, and a few brushes. Only
about 20 had horses, but barrows were occasionally
hired at a busy time.</p>

<p>In the foregoing estimates I have not included
any sums for apprentice fees, as I believe there
would be something like a balance in the matter,
the masters sometimes paying parents such premiums
for the use of their children as they received
from the parishes for the <i>tuition</i> and maintenance
of others.</p>

<p>Of the <i>morals</i>, <i>education</i>, <i>religion</i>, <i>marriage</i>,
&amp;c., of sweepers, under the two systems, I shall
speak in another place.</p>

<p>It may be somewhat curious to conclude with a
word of the extent of chimneys swept by a
climbing boy. One respectable master-sweeper told
me that for eleven years he had climbed five or
six days weekly. During this period he thought
he had swept fifteen chimneys as a week’s average,
each chimney being at least 40 feet in height;
so traversing, in ascending and descending,
686,400 feet, or 130 miles of a world of soot.
This, however, is little to what has been done
by a climber of 30 years’ standing, one of
the little men of whom I have spoken. My
informant entertained no doubt that this man had,
for the first 22 years of his career, climbed half
as much again as he himself had; or had traversed
2,059,200 feet of the interior of chimneys,
or 390 miles. Since the new Act this man had
of course climbed less, but had still been a good
deal employed; so that, adding his progresses for
the last 9 years to the 22 preceding, he must have
swept about 456 miles of chimney interiors.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Chimney-Sweepers of the Present
Day.</span></h3>

<p>The chimney-sweepers of the present day are
distinguished from those of old by the use of
machines instead of climbing boys, for the purpose
of removing the soot from the flues of houses.</p>

<p>The chimney-sweeping machines were first used
in this country in the year 1803. They were the
invention of Mr. Smart, a carpenter, residing at
the foot of Westminster-bridge, Surrey. On the
earlier trials of the machine (which was similar
to that used at present, and which I shall shortly
describe), it was pronounced successful in 99 cases
out of 100, according to some accounts, but failing
where sharp angles occurred in the flue, which
arrested its progress.</p>

<p>“Means have been suggested,” said Mr. Tooke,
formerly mentioned, in his evidence before a
Committee of the House of Commons, “for obviating
that difficulty by fixed apparatus at the
top of the flue with a jack-chain and pulley, by
which a brush could be worked up and down, or
it could be done as is customary abroad, as I have
repeatedly seen it at Petersburgh, and heard of its
being done universally on the Continent, by letting
down a bullet with a brush attached to it from
the top; but to obviate the inconvenience, which is
considerable, from persons going upon the roof of
a house, Mr. John White, junior, an eminent surveyor,
has suggested the expediency of putting
iron shutters or registers to each flue, in the roof
or cockloft of each house; by opening which, and
working the machine upwards and downwards, or
letting down the bullet, which is the most compendious
manner, the chimney will be most effectually
cleansed; and, by its aperture at bottom
being kept well closed, it would be done with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the least possible dirt and inconvenience to the
family.”</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The society for the supersedence of the labour
of climbing boys promoted the adoption of the
machines by all the means in their power, presenting
the new instrument gratuitously to several
master sweepers who were too poor to purchase it.
Experiments were made and duly published as to
the effectual manner in which the chimneys at
Guildhall, the Mansion House, the then new
Custom House, Dulwich College, and in other
public edifices, had been cleansed by the machine.
But these statements seem to have produced little
effect. People thought, perhaps, that the mechanical
means which might very well cleanse the
chimneys of large public buildings&mdash;and it was
said that the chimneys of the Custom House were
built with a view to the use of the machine&mdash;might
not be so serviceable for the same purposes
in small private dwellings. Experiments continued
to be made, often in the presence of architects, of
the more respectable sweepers, and of ladies and
gentlemen who took a philanthropic interest in the
question, between the years 1803 and 1817, but
with little influence upon the general public, for in
1817 Mr. Smart supposed that there were but 50
or 60 machines in general use in the metropolis,
and those, it appeared from the evidence of several
master sweepers, were used chiefly in gentlemen’s
houses, many of those gentlemen having to be
authoritative with their servants, who, if not controlled,
always preferred the services of the climbing
boys. Most servants had perquisites from the
master sweepers, in the largest and most profitable
ways of business, and they seemed to fear the
loss of those perquisites if any change took place.</p>

<p>The opposition in Parliament, and in the general
indifference of the people, to the efforts of “the
friends of the climbing boy” to supersede his
painful labours by the use of machinery, was
formidable enough, but that of the servants appears
to have been more formidable still. Mr. Smart
showed this in his explanations to the Committee.
The whole result of his experience was that
servants set their faces against the introduction of
the machine, grumbling if there were not even the
appearance of dirt on the furniture after its use.
“The first winter I went out with this machine,”
said Mr. Smart, “I went to Mr. Burke’s in Token-house
Yard, who was a friend of mine, with a man
to sweep the chimneys, and after waiting above an
hour in a cold morning, the housekeeper came
down quite in a rage, that we should presume to
ring the bell or knock at the door; and when we
got admittance, she swore she wished the machine
and the inventor at the devil; she did not know
me. We swept all the chimneys, and when we
had done I asked her what objection she had to it
now; she said, a very serious one, that if there
was a thing by which a servant could get any
emolument, some <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> invention was sure to
take it away from them, for that she received
perquisites.”</p>

<p>This avowal of Mr. Burke’s housekeeper, as
brusque as it was honest, is typical of the feelings
of the whole class of servants.</p>

<p>The opposition in Parliament, as I have intimated,
continued. One noble lord informed the
House of Peers that he had been indisposed of late
and had sought the aid of calomel, the curative
influence of which had pervaded every portion of
his frame; and that it as far surpassed the less
searching powers of other medicines, as the brush
of the climbing boy in cleansing every nook and
corner of the chimney, surpassed all the power of
the machinery, which left the soot unpurged from
those nooks and corners.</p>

<p>The House of Commons, however, had expressed
its conviction that as long as master chimney-sweepers
were permitted to employ climbing boys,
the natural result of that permission would be the
continuance of those miseries which the Legislature
had sought, but which it had failed, to put an end
to; and they therefore recommended that the use
of climbing boys should be prohibited altogether;
and that the age at which the apprenticeship
should commence should be extended from eight to
fourteen, putting this trade upon the same footing
as others which took apprentices at that age.</p>

<p>This resolution became law in 1829. The employment
of climbing boys in any manner in the
interior of chimneys was prohibited under penalties
of fine and imprisonment; and it was enacted
that the new measure should be carried into effect
in three years, so giving the master sweepers that
period of time to complete their arrangements.
During the course of the experiments and inquiry,
the sweepers, as a body, seem to have thrown no
obstacles, or very few and slight obstacles, in
the way of the “Committee to promote the
Superseding of the Labour of Climbing Boys;”
while the most respectable of the class, or the
majority of the respectable, aided the efforts of
the Committee.</p>

<p>This manifestation of public feeling probably
modified the opposition of the sweepers, and unquestionably
influenced the votes of members of
Parliament. The change in the operations of the
chimney-sweeping business took place in 1832,
as quietly and unnoticedly as if it were no change
at all.</p>

<p>The machine now in use differs little from that
invented by Mr. Smart, the first introduced, but
lighter materials are now used in its manufacture.
It has not been found necessary, however, to complicate
its use with the jack-chain and pulley, and
bullet with a brush attached, and the iron shutters
or registers in the roof or cockloft, of which Mr.
Tooke spoke.</p>

<p>The machine is formed of a series of hollow
rods, made of a supple cane, bending and not
breaking in any sinuosity of the flues. This cane
is made of the same material as gentlemen’s
walking-sticks. The first machines were made of
wood, and were liable to be broken; and to enable
the sweeps on such occasions to recover
the broken part, a strong line ran from bottom to
top through the centre of the sticks, which were
bored for the purpose, and strung on this cord.
The cane machine, however, speedily and effectually
superseded these imperfect instruments; and
there are now none of them to be met with. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the top tube of the machine is attached the
“brush,” called technically “the head,” of elastic
whalebone spikes, which “give” and bend, in
accordance with the up or down motion communicated
by the man working the machine, so
sweeping what was described to me as “both
ways,” up and down.</p>

<p>Some of these rods, which fit into one another
by means of brass screws, are 4 feet 6 inches
long, and diminish in diameter to suit their
adjustment. Some rods are but 3 feet 6 inches long,
and 4 feet is the full average length; while the
average price at the machine maker’s is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
rod, if bought separately. The head costs 10<i>s.</i>,
on an average, if bought separately. It is seldom
that a machine is required to number beyond
17 rods (extending 68 feet), and the better class
of sweepers are generally provided with 17 rods.
The cost of the entire machine, for every kind of
chimney-work, when purchased new, as a whole,
is, when of good quality, from 30<i>s.</i> to 5<i>l.</i>, according
to the number of rods, duplicate rods, &amp;c.
Mr. Smart stated, in 1817, that the average price
of one of his machines was then 2<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The sweepers who labour chiefly in the poorer
localities&mdash;and several told me how indifferent
many people in those parts were as to their chimneys
being swept at all&mdash;rarely use a machine to
extend beyond 40 feet, or one composed of 10 or 11
rods; but some of the inferior class of sweepers
buy of those in a superior way of trade worn
machines, at from a third to a half of the prime
cost. These machines they trim up themselves.
One portion of the work, however, they cannot
repair or renew&mdash;the broken or worn-out brass
screws of the rods, which they call the “ferules.”
These, when new, are 1<i>s.</i> each. There were, when
the machine-work was novel, I was informed,
street-artizans who went about repairing these
screws or ferules; but their work did not please
the chimney-sweepers, and this street-trade did not
last above a year or two.</p>

<p>The rods of the machine, when carefully attended
to, last a long time. One man told me
that he was still working some rods which he had
worked since 1842 (nine years), with occasional
renewal of the ferules. The head is either injured
or worn down in about two years; if not
well made at first, in a year. The diameter of
this head or brush is, on the average, 18 inches.
One of my informants had himself swept a chimney
of 80 feet, and one of his fellow-workers
had said that he once swept a chimney of 120
feet high; in both cases by means of the machine.
My informant, however, thought such a feat as
the 120-feet sweep was hardly possible, as only
one man’s strength can be applied to the machine;
and he was of opinion that no man’s muscular
powers would be sufficient to work a machine
at a height of 120 feet. The labour is
sometimes very severe; “enough,” one strongly-built
man told me, “to make your arms, head,
and heart ache.”</p>

<p>The old-fashioned chimneys are generally 12
by 14 inches in their dimensions in the interior;
and for the thorough sweeping of such chimneys&mdash;the
opinion of all the sweepers I saw according on
the subject&mdash;a head (it is rarely called brush in
the trade) of 18 inches diameter is insufficient,
yet they are seldom used larger. One intelligent
master sweeper, speaking from his own knowledge,
told me that in the neighbourhood where he
worked numbers of houses had been built since
the introduction of the machines, and the chimneys
were only 9 inches square, as regards the
interior; the smaller flues are sometimes but 7.
These 9-inch chimneys, he told me, were frequent
in “scamped” houses, houses got up at the
lowest possible rate by speculating builders. This
was done because the brickwork of the chimneys
costs more than the other portions of the masonry,
and so the smaller the dimensions of the chimneys
the less the cost of the edifice. The machines
are sometimes as much crippled in this circumscribed
space as they are found of insufficient dimensions
in the old-fashioned chimneys; and so
the “scamped” chimney, unless by a master having
many “heads,” is not so cleanly swept as it
might be. Chimneys not built in this manner
are now usually 9 inches by 14.</p>

<p>In cleansing a chimney with the machine the
sweep stands by, or rather in, the fire-place,
having first attached a sort of curtain to the
mantle to confine the soot to one spot, the operator
standing inside this curtain. He first introduces
the “head,” attached to its proper rod, into the
chimney, “driving” it forward, then screws on
the next rod, and so on, until the head has been
driven to the top of the chimney. The soot
which has fallen upon the hearth, within the
curtain, is collected into a sack or sacks, and is
carried away on the men’s backs, and occasionally
in carts. The whalebone spikes of the head are
made to extend in every direction, so that when
it is moved no part of the chimney, if the surface
be even, escapes contact with these spikes, if
the work be carefully done, as indeed it generally
is; for the cleaner the chimney is swept of
course the greater amount of soot adds to the
profit of the sweeper. One man told me that he
thought he had seen in some old big chimneys, a
long time unswept, more soot brought down by
the machine than, under similar circumstances as
to the time the chimney had remained uncleansed,
would have been done by the climbing boy.</p>

<p>All the master sweepers I saw concurred in the
opinion that the machine was <i>not</i> in all respects
so effective a sweeper as the climbing boy, as it
does not reach the recesses, nooks, crannies, or
holes in the chimney, where the soot remains little
disturbed by the present process. This want is felt
the most in the cleansing of the old-fashioned
chimneys, especially in the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Cook, in 1817, stated to the Committee
that the cleansing of a chimney by a boy or by a
machine occupied the same space of time; but I
find the general opinion of the sweepers now to be
that it is only the small and straight chimneys
which can be swept with as great celerity by a
machine as by a climber; in all others the lad
was quicker by about 5 minutes in 30, or in that
proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard sweepers represent that the passing of
the Act of Parliament not only deprived them in
many instances of the unexpired term of a boy’s
apprenticeship in his services as a climber, but
“threw open the business to any one.” The
business, however, it seems, was always “open to
any one.” There was no art nor mystery in it, as
regarded the functions of the master; any one
could send a boy up a chimney, and collect and
carry away the soot he brought down, quite as
readily and far more easily than he can work a
machine. Nevertheless, men under the old system
could hardly (and some say they were forbidden
to) embark in this trade unless they had been
apprenticed to it; for they were at a loss how
to possess themselves of climbing boys, and how
to make a connection. When the machines were
introduced, however, a good many persons who
were able to “raise the price” of one started
in the line on their own account. These men
have been called by the old hands “leeks” or
“green ’uns,” to distinguish them from the regularly-trained
men, who pride themselves not a
little on the fact of their having served seven or
eight years, “duly and truly,” as they never fail
to express it. This increase of fresh hands tended
to lower the earnings of the class; and some
masters, who were described to me as formerly
very “comfortable,” and some, comparatively
speaking, rich, were considerably reduced by it.
The number of “leeks” in 1832 I heard stated, with
the exaggeration to which I have been accustomed
when uninformed men, ignorant of the relative
value of numbers, have expressed their opinions,
as 1000!</p>

<p>The several classes in the chimney-sweeping
trade may be arranged as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>Master Chimney-Sweepers</i>, called sometimes
“Governors” by the journeymen, are divisible
into three <span class="lock">kinds:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The “large” or “high masters,” who employ
from 2 to 10 men and 2 boys, and keep sometimes
2 horses and a cart, not particularly for the conveyance
of the soot, but to go into the country to
a gentleman’s house to fulfil orders.</p>

<p>The “small” or “low masters,” who employ,
on an average, two men, and sometimes but one
man and a boy, without either horse or cart.</p>

<p>The “single-handed master-men,” who employ
neither men nor boys, but do all the work themselves.</p>

<p>Of these three classes of masters there are two
subdivisions.</p>

<p>The “leeks” or “green-uns,” that is to say,
those who have not regularly served their time to
the trade.</p>

<p>The “knullers” or “queriers,” that is to say,
those who solicit custom in an irregular manner,
by knocking at the doors of houses and such like.</p>

<p>Of the competition of capitalists in this trade
there are, I am told, no instances. “We have
our own stations,” one master sweeper said, “and
if I contract to sweep a genelman’s house, here
in Pancras, for 25<i>s.</i> a year, or 10<i>s.</i>, or anythink,
my nearest neighbour, as has men and machines
fit, is in Marrybun; and it wouldn’t pay to send
his men a mile and a half, or on to two mile, and
work at what I can&mdash;let alone less. No, sir, I’ve
known bisness nigh 20 year, and there’s nothink
in the way of that underworking. The poor
creeturs as keeps theirselves with a machine,
and nothing to give them a lift beyond it, <i>they’d</i>
undertake work at any figure, but nobody employs
or can trust to them, but on chance.” The
contracts, I am told, for a year’s chimney-sweeping
in any mansion are on the same terms with one
master as with another.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>Journeymen Chimney-Sweepers</i>
there are also three <span class="lock">kinds:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The “foreman” or “first journeyman” sweeper,
who accompanies the men to their work, superintends
their labours, and receives the money,
when paid immediately after sweeping.</p>

<p>The “journeyman” sweeper, whose duty it is to
work the machine, and (where no under-journeyman,
or boy, is kept) to carry the machine and
take home the soot.</p>

<p>The “under-journeyman” or “boy,” who has
to carry the machine, take home the soot, and
work the machine up the lower-class flues.</p>

<p>There are, besides these, some 20 climbing men,
who ascend such flues as the machines cannot
cleanse effectually, and, it must, I regret to say,
be added, some 20 to 30 climbing boys, mostly
under eleven years of age, who are still used for
the same purpose “on the sly.” Many of the
masters, indeed, lament the change to machine-sweeping,
saying that their children, who are now
useless, would, in “the good old times,” have been
worth a pound a week to them. It is in the
suburbs that these climbing children are mostly
employed.</p>

<p>The <i>hours of labour</i> are from the earliest
morning till about midday, and sometimes later.</p>

<p>There are <i>no Houses of Call</i>, trade societies, or
regulations among these operatives, but there are
low public-houses to which they resort, and where
they can always be heard of.</p>

<p>When a chimney-sweeper is out of work he
merely inquires of others in the same line of business,
who, if they know of any one that wants
a journeyman, direct their brother sweeper to call
and see the master; but though the chimney-sweepers
have no trade societies, some of the better
class belong to sick, and others to burial, funds.
The lower class of sweepers, however, seem to have
no resource in sickness, or in their utmost need,
but the parish. There are sweepers, I am told, in
every workhouse in London.</p>

<p>There are three <i>modes of payment common</i>
among the <span class="lock">sweepers:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1, in money;</li>
<li>2, partly in money and partly in kind; and</li>
<li>3, by perquisites.</li>
</ul>


<p>The great majority of the masters pay the men
they employ from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i>, and a few 4<i>s.</i> and 6<i>s.</i>
per week, together with their board and lodging.
It may seem that 3<i>s.</i> per week is a small sum,
but it was remarked to me that there are few
working men who, after supporting themselves,
are able to save that sum weekly, while the
sweepers have many perquisites of one sort or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
other, which sometimes bring them in 1<i>s.</i>, 2<i>s.</i>, 3<i>s.</i>,
4<i>s.</i>, and occasionally 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i>, a week additional&mdash;a
sufficient sum to pay for clothes and washing.
The journeymen, when lodged in the house of
the master, are single men, and if constantly employed
might, perhaps, do well, but they are
often unemployed, especially in the summer, when
there are not so many fires kept burning. As
soon as one of them gets married, or what among
them is synonymous, “takes up with a woman,”
which they commonly do when they are able to
purchase some sort of a machine, they set up for
themselves, and thus a great number of the men
get to be masters on their own account, without
being able to employ any extra hands. These are
generally reckoned among the “knullers;” they
do but little business at first, for the masters long
established in a neighbourhood, who are known
to the people, and have some standing, are almost
always preferred to those who are strangers or
mere beginners.</p>

<p>It was very common, but perhaps more common
in country towns than in London, for the journeymen,
as well as apprentices, in this and many
other trades to live at the master’s table. But the
board and lodging supplied, in lieu of money-wages,
to the journeymen sweepers, seems to be one of
the few existing instances of such a practice in
London. Among slop-working tailors and shoemakers,
some unfortunate workmen are boarded
and lodged by their employers, but these employers
are merely middlemen, who gain their
living by serving such masters as “do not like to
drive their negroes themselves.” But among the
sweepers there are no middlemen.</p>

<p>It is not all the journeymen sweepers, however,
who are remunerated after this manner, for many
receive 12<i>s.</i>, and some 14<i>s.</i>, and not a few 18<i>s.</i>
weekly, besides perquisites, but reside at their
own homes.</p>

<p><i>Apprenticeship</i> is now not at all common among
the sweepers, as no training to the business is
needed. Lord Shaftesbury, however, in July last,
gave notice of his intention to bring in a bill to
prevent persons who had not been duly apprenticed
to the business establishing themselves as
sweepers.</p>

<p><i>The Perquisites</i> of the journeymen sweepers are
for measuring, arranging, and putting the soot sold
into the purchasers’ sacks, or carts; for this is
considered extra work. The payment of this perquisite
seems to be on no fixed scale, some having
1<i>s.</i> for 50, and some for 100 bushels. When a
chimney is on fire and a journeyman sweeper is
employed to extinguish it, he receives from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to 5<i>s.</i> according to the extent of time consumed
and the risk of being injured. “Chance sweeping,”
or the sweeping of a chimney not belonging
to a customer, when a journeyman has completed
his regular round, ensures him 3<i>d.</i> in some employments,
but in fewer than was once the case. The
beer-money given by any customer to a journeyman
is also his perquisite. Where a foreman is
kept, the “brieze,” or cinders collected from the
grate, belong to him, and the ashes belong to the
journeyman; but where there is no foreman, the
brieze and ashes belong to the journeyman solely.
These they sell to the poor at the rate of 6<i>d.</i> a
bushel. I am told by experienced men that, all
these matters considered, it may be stated that
one-half of the journeymen in London have perquisites
of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, the other half of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week.</p>

<p><i>The Nominal Wages</i> to the journeymen, then,
are from 12<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> weekly, without board and
lodging, or from 2<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> in money, with board
and lodging, represented as equal to 7<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>The Actual Wages</i> are 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week more in
the form of perquisites, and perhaps 4<i>d.</i> daily in
beer or gin.</p>

<p>The wages to the boys are mostly 1<i>s.</i> a week,
but many masters pay 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>, with board
and lodging. These boys have no perquisites,
except such bits of broken victuals as are given to
them at houses where they go to sweep.</p>

<p>The wages of the foreman are generally 18<i>s.</i>
per week, but some receive 14<i>s.</i> and some 20<i>s.</i>
without board and lodging. In one case, where
the foreman is kept by the master, only 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in
money is given to him weekly. The perquisites
of these men average from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> a week.</p>

<p><i>The work in the chimney-sweeping trade is more
regular than might at first be supposed.</i> The
sweepers whose circumstances enable them to employ
journeymen send them on regular rounds,
and do not engage “chance” hands. If business
is brisk, the men and the master, when a working
man himself, work later than ordinary, and sometimes
another hand is put on and paid the customary
amount, by the week, until the briskness
ceases; but this is a rare occurrence. There
are, however, strong lads, or journeymen out of
work, who are <i>occasionally</i> employed in “<i>jobbing</i>,”
helping to carry the soot and such like.</p>

<p>The labour of the journeymen, as regards the
payment by their masters, is <i>continuous</i>, but the
men are often discharged for drunkenness, or for
endeavouring to “form a connection of their own”
among their employers’ customers, and new hands
are then put on. “Chimneys won’t wait, you
know, sir,” was said to me, “and if I quit a hand
this week, there’s another in his place next. If
I discharge a hand for three months in a slack
time, I have two on when it’s a busy time.”
Perhaps the average employment of the whole
body of operatives may be taken at nine months’
work in the year. When out of employment the
chief resource of these men is in night-work;
some turn street-sellers and bricklayers’ labourers.</p>

<p>I am told that a considerable sum of money
was left for the purpose of supplying every climbing-boy
who called on the first of May at a certain
place, with a shilling and some refreshment, but I
have not been able to ascertain by whom it was
left, or where it was distributed; none of the
sweepers with whom I conversed knew anything
about it. I also heard, that since the passing of
the Act, the money has been invested in some
securities or other, and is now accumulating, but
to what purpose it is intended to be applied I
have no means of learning.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavour to estimate the gross
yearly income of the operative sweepers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, then, 399 men employed as journeymen,
and of them 147 receive a money wage
weekly from their masters, and reside with their
parents or at their own places. The remaining
252 are boarded and lodged. This board and
lodging are generally computed, as under the
old system, to represent 8<i>s.</i>, being 1<i>s.</i> a day for
board and 1<i>s.</i> a week for lodging. But, on the
average, the board does not cost the masters 7<i>s.</i> a
week, but, as I shall afterwards show, barely 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The men and boys may be said to be all fully
employed for nine months in the year; some, of
course, are at work all the year through, but others
get only six months’ employment in the twelve
months; so that taking nine months as the average,
we have the following table of</p>

<p>Thus we find that the <i>constant</i> or <i>average casual</i>
wages of the several classes of operative chimney-sweepers
may be taken as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>

<p>The <i>general</i> wages of the trade, including foreman,
journeymen, and boys, and calculating the
perquisites to average 2<i>s.</i> weekly, will be 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week, the same as the cotton factory operatives.</p>

<p>But if 10,500<i>l.</i> be the income of the operatives,
what do the employers receive who have to
pay this sum?</p>

<p>The charge for sweeping one of the lofty
chimneys in the public and official edifices, and
in the great houses in the aristocratic streets and
squares, is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The chimneys of moderate-sized houses are swept
at 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, and those of the poorer
classes are charged generally 6<i>d.</i>; some, however,
are swept at 3<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i>; and when soot realized
a higher price (some of the present master sweepers
<i>have</i> sold it at 1<i>s.</i> a bushel), the chimneys of poor
persons were swept by the poorer class of sweeps
merely for the perquisite of the soot. This is sometimes
done even now, but to a very small extent,
by a sweeper, “on his own hook,” and in want
of a job, but generally with an injunction to the
person whose chimney has been cleansed on such
easy terms, not to mention it, as it “couldn’t be
made a practice on.”</p>

<p>Estimating the number of houses belonging to
the wealthy classes of society to be 54,000, and
these to be swept eight times a year, and the
charge for sweeping to be 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each time; and
the number of houses belonging to the middle
classes to be 90,000, and each to be swept four
times a year, at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each time; and the dwellings
of the poor and labouring classes to be swept
once a year at 6<i>d.</i> each time, and the number of
such dwellings to be 165,000, we find that the
total sum paid to the master chimney-sweepers of
London is, in round numbers, 85,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The sum obtained for 800,000 bushels of soot
collected by the master-sweepers from the houses
of London, at 5<i>d.</i> per bushel, is 16,500<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Thus the total annual income of the master-sweepers
of London is 100,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Out of this 100,000<i>l.</i> per annum, the expenses
of the masters would appear to be as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The rent here given may seem low at 12<i>l.</i>
a year, but many of the chimney-sweepers live in
parlours, with cellars below, in old out-of-the-way
places, at a low rental, in Stepney, Shadwell,
Wapping, Bethnal-green, Hoxton, Lock’s-fields,
Walworth, Newington, Islington, Somers-town,
Paddington, &amp;c. The better sort of master-sweepers
at the West-end often live in a mews.</p>

<p>The gains, then, of the master sweepers are as
<span class="lock">under:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Annual income for cleansing chimneys and soot</td><td>£100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Expenditure for wages, rent, wear, and tear, keep of horses, &amp;c., say</td><td>20,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Annual profit of master chimney-sweepers of London</td><td class="total">£80,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This amount of profit, divided among 350
masters, gives about 230<i>l.</i> per annum to each
individual; it is only by a few, however, that
such a sum is realized, as in the 100,000<i>l.</i> paid
by the London public to the sweepers’ trade, is
included the sum received by the men who work
single-handed, “on their own hook,” as they say,
employing no journeymen. Of these men’s earnings,
the accounts I heard from themselves and
the other master sweepers were all accordant,
that they barely made journeymen’s wages. They
have the very worst-paid portion of the trade,
receiving neither for their sweeping nor their soot
the prices obtained by the better masters; indeed
they very frequently sell their soot to their more
prosperous brethren. Their general statement
is, that they make “eighteen pence a day, and all
told.” Their receipts then, and they have no
perquisites as have the journeymen, are, in a slack
time, about 1<i>s.</i> a day (and some days they do not
get a job); but in the winter they are busier, as
it is then that sweepers are employed by the poor;
and at that period the “master-men” may make
from 15<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> a week each; so that, I am assured,
the average of their weekly takings may
be estimated at 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Now, deducting the expenditure from the
receipts of 100,000<i>l.</i> (for sweeping and soot), the
balance, as we have seen, is 80,000<i>l.</i>, an amount
of profit which, if equally divided among the
three classes of the trade, will give the following
<span class="lock">sums:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Nor is this estimate of the masters’ profits, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
am assured, extravagant. One of the smaller
sweepers, but a prosperous man in his way, told me
that he knew a master sweeper who was “as
rich as Crœser, had bought houses, and could
not write his own name.”</p>

<p>We have now but to estimate the amount of
capital invested in the chimney-sweepers’ trade,
and then to proceed to the characteristics of the
men.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the sweepers will
require the services of more than 25 horses, but I
am assured that such is not the case as regards the
soot business, for the soot is carted away from the
sweepers’ premises by the farmer or other purchaser.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that the facts of the
chimney-sweepers’ trade are briefly as <span class="lock">under:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The gross quantity of soot collected yearly
throughout London is 800,000 bushels. The
value of this, sold as manure, at 5<i>d.</i> per bushel, is
16,500<i>l.</i></p>

<p>There are 800 to 900 people employed in the
trade, 200 of whom are masters employing journeymen,
150 single-handed master-men, and 470
journeymen and under journeymen.</p>

<p>The annual income of the entire number of
journeymen is 10,500<i>l.</i> without perquisites, or
13,000<i>l.</i> with, which gives an average weekly
wage to the operatives of 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The annual income of the masters and leeks is,
for sweeping and soot, 100,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The annual expenditure of the masters for
rent, keep of horses, wear and tear, and wages, is
20,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The gross annual profit of the 350 masters
is 80,000<i>l.</i>, which is at the rate of about 35<i>l.</i>
per annum to each of the single-handed men,
200<i>l.</i> to each of the smaller masters employing
journeymen, and 500<i>l.</i> to each of the larger
masters.</p>

<p>The capital of the trade is about 5000<i>l.</i></p>

<p><i>The price charged</i> by the “high master
sweepers” for cleaning the flues of a house rented
at 150<i>l.</i> a year and upwards, is from 1<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
(the higher price being paid for sweeping those
chimneys which have a hot plate affixed). A
small master, on the other hand, will charge from
1<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> for the same kind of work, while a
single-handed man seldom gets above “a 2<i>s.</i> job,”
and that not very often. The charge for sweeping
the flues of a house rented at from 50<i>l.</i> to 150<i>l.</i> a
year, is from 9<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> by a large master, and
from 8<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> by a small master, while a single-handed
man will take the job at from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
The price charged per flue for a house rented at
from 20<i>l.</i> a year up to 50<i>l.</i> a year, will average
6<i>d.</i> a flue, charged by large masters, 4<i>d.</i> by small
masters, and from 2<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> by the single-handed
sweepers in some cases; indeed, the poorest
class will sweep a flue for the soot only. But
the prices charged for sweeping chimneys differ
in the different parts of the metropolis. I subjoin
a list of the maximum and minimum charge for
the several districts.</p>

<p><i>There are three different kinds of soot</i>:&mdash;the
best is produced purely from coal; the next in
value is that which proceeds from the combustion
of vegetable refuse along with the coal, as in
cases where potato peelings, cabbage leaves, and
the like, are burnt in the fires of the poorer
classes; while the soot produced from wood fires
is, I am told, scarcely worth carriage. Wood-soot,
however, is generally mixed with that from
coal, and sold as the superior kind.</p>

<p>Not only is there a difference in value in the
various kinds of soot, but there is also a vast
difference in the weight. A bushel of pure coal
soot will not weigh above four pounds; that produced
from the combustion of coal and vegetable
refuse will weigh nearly thrice as much; while
that from wood fires is, I am assured, nearly ten
times heavier than from coal.</p>

<p>I have not heard that the introduction of free
trade has had any influence on the value of soot,
or in reducing the wages of the operatives. The
same wages are paid to the operatives whether
soot sells at a high or low price.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the General Characteristics of the
Working Chimney-Sweepers.</span></h3>

<p>There are many reasons why the chimney-sweepers
have ever been a distinct and peculiar
class. They have long been looked down
upon as the lowest order of workers, and treated
with contumely by those who were but little
better than themselves. The peculiar nature of
their work giving them not only a filthy appearance,
but an offensive smell, of itself, in a manner,
prohibited them from associating with other working
men; and the natural effect of such
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>proscription
has been to compel them to herd together
apart from others, and to acquire habits and peculiarities
of their own widely differing from the
characteristics of the rest of the labouring
classes.</p>

<p>These returns have been collected by personal visits to each district:&mdash;the name of each master throughout London,
together with the number of Foremen, Journeymen, and Under Journeymen employed, and the Wages received by
each, as well as the quantity of soot collected, have been likewise obtained; but the names of the masters are here
omitted for want of space, and the results alone are given.</p></div>

<p>Sweepers, however, have not from this cause
generally been an hereditary race&mdash;that is, they
have not become sweepers from father to son for
many generations. Their numbers were, in the
days of the climbing boys, in most instances increased
by parish apprentices, the parishes usually
adopting that mode as the cheapest and easiest
of freeing themselves from a part of the burden
of juvenile pauperism. The climbing boys, but
more especially the unfortunate parish apprentices,
were almost always cruelly used, starved, beaten,
and over-worked by their masters, and treated as
outcasts by all with whom they came in contact:
there can be no wonder, then, that, driven
in this manner from all other society, they gladly
availed themselves of the companionship of their
fellow-sufferers; quickly imbibed all their habits
and peculiarities; and, perhaps, ended by becoming
themselves the most tyrannical masters to those
who might happen to be placed under their charge.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the disrepute in which sweepers
have ever been held, there are many classes of
workers beneath them in intelligence. All the
tribe of finders and collectors (with the exception
of the dredgermen, who are an observant race,
and the sewer-hunters, who, from the danger of
their employment, are compelled to exercise their
intellects) are far inferior to them in this respect;
and they are clever fellows compared to many of
the dustmen and scavagers. The great mass of
the agricultural labourers are known to be almost
as ignorant as the beasts they drive; but the
sweepers, from whatever cause it may arise, are
known, in many instances, to be shrewd, intelligent,
and active.</p>

<p>But there is much room for improvement among
the operative chimney-sweepers. Speaking of the
men generally, I am assured that there is scarcely one
out of ten who can either read or write. One man in
Chelsea informed me that some ladies, in connection
with the Rev. Mr. Cadman’s church, made
an attempt to instruct the sweepers of the neighbourhood
in reading and writing; but the master
sweepers grew jealous, and became afraid lest their
men should get too knowing for them. When the
time came, therefore, for the men to prepare for
the school, the masters always managed to find
out some job which prevented them from attending
at the appointed time, and the consequence was
that the benevolent designs of the ladies were
frustrated.</p>

<p>The sweepers, as a class, in almost all their
habits, bear a strong resemblance to the costermongers.
The habit of going about in search
of their employment has, of itself, implanted
in many of them the wandering propensity peculiar
to street people. Many of the better-class
costermongers have risen into coal-shed men and
greengrocers, and become settled in life; in like
manner the better-class sweepers have risen to be
masters, and, becoming settled in a locality, have
gradually obtained the trade of the neighbourhood;
then, as their circumstances improved, they have
been able to get horses and carts, and become
nightmen; and there are many of them at this
moment men of wealth, comparatively speaking.
The great body of them, however, retain in all their
force their original characteristics; the masters
themselves, although shrewd and sensible men,
often betray their want of education, and are in no
way particular as to their expressions, their language
being made up, in a great measure, of the
terms peculiar to the costermongers, especially the
denominations of the various sorts of money. I
met with some sweepers, however, whose language
was that in ordinary use, and their manners not
vulgar. I might specify one, who, although a
workhouse orphan and apprentice, a harshly-treated
climbing-boy, is now prospering as a
sweeper and nightman, is a regular attendant at
all meetings to promote the good of the poor, and
a zealous ragged-school teacher, and teetotaller.</p>

<p>When such men are met with, perhaps the class
cannot be looked upon as utterly cast away,
although the need of reformation in the habits of
the working sweepers is extreme, and especially
in respect of drinking, gambling, and dirt. The
journeymen (who have often a good deal of
leisure) and the single-handed men are&mdash;in the
great majority of cases at least&mdash;addicted to drinking,
beer being their favourite beverage, either
because it is the cheapest or that they fancy it the
most suitable for washing away the sooty particles
which find their way to their throats. These
men gamble also, but with this proviso&mdash;they
seldom play for money; but when they meet in
their usual houses of resort&mdash;two famous ones are
in Back <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> lane and <span class="lock">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> street, Whitechapel&mdash;they
spend their time and what money
they may have in tossing for beer, till they are
either drunk or penniless. Such men present
the appearance of having just come out of
a chimney. There seems never to have been any
attempt made by them to wash the soot off their
faces. I am informed that there is scarcely one
of them who has a second shirt or any change of
clothes, and that they wear their garments night
and day till they literally rot, and drop in fragments
from their backs. Those who are not employed
as journeymen by the masters are frequently
whole days without food, especially in
summer, when the work is slack; and it usually
happens that those who are what is called
“knocking about on their own account” seldom
or never have a farthing in their pockets in the
morning, and may, perhaps, have to travel till
evening before they get a threepenny or sixpenny
chimney to sweep. When night comes, and they
meet their companions, the tossing and drinking
again commences; they again get drunk; roll home
to wherever it may be, to go through the same
routine on the morrow; and this is the usual
tenour of their lives, whether earning 5<i>s.</i> or 20<i>s.</i> a
week.</p>

<p>The chimney-sweepers generally are fond of
drink; indeed their calling, like that of dustmen,
is one of those which naturally lead to it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
men declare they are ordered to drink gin and
smoke as much as they can, in order to rid the
stomach of the soot they may have swallowed during
their work.</p>

<p><i>Washing</i> among chimney-sweepers seems to
be much more frequent than it was. In the evidence
before Parliament it was stated that some
of the climbing-boys were washed once in six
months, some once a week, some once in two
or three months. I do not find it anywhere
stated that any of these children were never
washed at all; but from the tenour of the evidence
it may be reasonably concluded that such
was the case.</p>

<p>A master sweeper, who was in the habit of
bathing at the Marylebone baths once and sometimes
twice a week, assured me that, although
many now eat and drink and sleep sooty, washing
is more common among his class than when he
himself was a climbing-boy. He used then to be
stripped, and compelled to step into a tub, and
into water sometimes too hot and sometimes too
cold, while his mistress, to use his own word,
<i>scoured</i> him. Judging from what he had seen
and heard, my informant was satisfied that, from
30 to 40 years ago, climbing-boys, with a very
few exceptions, were but seldom washed; and
then it was looked upon by them as a most disagreeable
operation, often, indeed, as a species of
punishment. Some of the climbing-boys used to
be taken by their masters to bathe in the Serpentine
many years ago; but one boy was unfortunately
drowned, so that the children could
hardly be coerced to go into the water afterwards.</p>

<p>The washing among the chimney-sweepers of
the present day, when there are scarcely any
climbing-boys, is so much an individual matter
that it is not possible to speak with any great
degree of certainty on the subject, but that it
increases may be concluded from the fact that the
number of sweeps who resort to the public baths
increases.</p>

<p>The first public baths and washhouses opened
in London were in the “north-west district,” and
situated in George-street, Euston-square, near the
Hampstead-road. This establishment was founded
by voluntary contribution in 1846, and is now
self-supporting.</p>

<p>There are three more public baths: one in
Goulston-street, Whitechapel (on the same principle
as that first established); another in St.
Martin’s, near the National Gallery, which are
parochial; and the last in Marylebone, near the
Yorkshire Stingo tavern, New-road, also parochial.
The charge for a cold bath, each being
secluded from the others, is 1<i>d.</i>, with the use of a
towel; a warm bath is 2<i>d.</i> in the third class.
The following is the return of the number of
bathers at the north-west district baths, the establishment
most <span class="lock">frequented:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

<p>I endeavoured to ascertain the proportion of
sweepers, with other working men, who availed
themselves of these baths; but there are unfortunately
no data for instituting a comparison as
to the relative cleanliness of the several trades.
When the baths were first opened an endeavour
was made to obtain such a return; but it was
found to be distasteful to the bathers, and so was
discontinued. We find, then, that in four years
there have been 406,051 bathers. The following
gives the proportion between the sexes, a portion
of 1846 being <span class="lock">included:&mdash;</span></p>

<tr><td class="left">Total bathers</td><td class="total">464,538</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The falling off in the number of bathers at this
establishment is, I am told, attributable to the
opening of new baths, the people, of course, resorting
to the nearest.</p>

<p>I have given the return of washers, &amp;c., as I
endeavoured to ascertain the proportion of washing
by the chimney-sweeper’s wives; but there is
no specification of the trades of the persons using
this branch of the establishment any more than
there is of those frequenting the baths, and for
the same reason as prevented its being done
among the bathers. One of the attendants at
these washhouses told me that he had no doubt
the sweepers’ wives did wash there, for he had
more than once seen a sweeper waiting to carry
home the clothes his wife had cleansed. As no
questions concerning their situation in life are
asked of the poor women who resort to these
very excellent institutions (for such they appear
to be on a cursory glance) of course no data can be
supplied. This is to be somewhat regretted; but
a regard to the feelings, and in some respects to
the small prejudices, of the industrious poor is to
be commended rather than otherwise, and the
managers of these baths certainly seem to have
manifested such a regard.</p>

<p>I am informed, however, by the secretary of
the north-west district institution, that in some
weeks of the summer 80 chimney-sweepers bathed
there; always having, he believed, warm baths,
which are more effective in removing soot or dirt
from the skin than cold. Summer, it must be
remembered, is the sweep’s “brisk” season. In
a winter week as few as 25 or 20 have bathed,
but the weekly average of sweeper-bathers, the
year through, is about 50; and the number of
sweeper-bathers, he thought, had increased since
the opening of the baths about 10 per cent.
yearly. As in 1850 the average number of
bathers of all classes did not exceed 1646 per
week, the proportion of sweepers, 50, is high.
The number of female bathers is about one-ninth,
so that the males would be about 1480; and the
50 sweepers a week constitute about a thirtieth
part of the whole of the third-class bathers. The
number of sweep-bathers was known because a
sweep is known by his appearance.</p>

<p>I was told by the secretary that the sweepers,
the majority bathing on Saturday nights, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
carried a bundle to the bath; this contained their
“clean things.” After bathing they assumed
their “Sunday clothes;” and from the change
in their appearance between ingress and egress,
they were hardly recognisable as the same individuals.</p>

<p>In the other baths, where also there is no
specification of the bathers, I am told, that of
sweepers bathing the number (on computation) is
30 at Marylebone, 25 at Goulston-street, and 15
(at the least) at St. Martin’s, as a weekly average.
In all, 120 sweepers bathe weekly, or about a
seventh of the entire working body. The increase
at the three baths last mentioned, in
sweepers bathing, is from 5 to 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Among the lower-class sweepers there are but
few who wash themselves even once throughout
the year. They eat, drink, and sleep in the same
state of filth and dirt as when engaged in their
daily avocation. Others, however, among the
better class are more cleanly in their habits, and
wash themselves every night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Between <i>the appearance of the sweepers</i> in the
streets at the present time and before the abolition
of the system of climbing there is a marked
difference. Charles Lamb said (in 1823):&mdash;</p>

<p>“I like to meet a sweep&mdash;understand me, not
a grown sweeper&mdash;old chimney-sweepers are by
no means attractive&mdash;but one of those tender
novices blooming through their first nigritude,
the maternal washings not quite effaced from the
cheek&mdash;such as come forth with the dawn, or
somewhat earlier, with their little professional
notes sounding like the <i>peep peep</i> of a young
sparrow; or liker to the matin lark should I
pronounce them, in their aerial ascents not seldom
anticipating the sunrise?”</p>

<p>Throughout his essay, Elia throws the halo of
poetry over the child-sweepers, calling them “dim
specks,” “poor blots,” “innocent blacknesses,”
“young Africans of our own growth;” the
natural kindliness of the writer shines out through
all. He counsels his reader to give the young
innocent 2<i>d.</i>, or, if the weather were starving,
“let the demand on thy humanity rise to a
tester” (6<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p>The appearance of the little children-sweepers,
as they trotted along at the master’s or the journeyman’s
heels, or waited at “rich men’s doors” on a
cold morning, was pitiable in the extreme. If it
snowed, there was a strange contrast between
the black sootiness of the sweeper’s dress and the
white flakes of snow which adhered to it. The
boy-sweeper trotted listlessly along; a sack to
contain the soot thrown over his shoulder, or
disposed round his neck, like a cape or shawl.
One master sweeper tells me that in his apprenticeship
days he had to wait at the great mansions
in and about Grosvenor-square, on some
bitter wintry mornings, until he felt as if his feet,
although he had both stockings and shoes&mdash;and
many young climbers were barefoot&mdash;felt as if
frozen to the pavement. When the door was
opened, he told me, the matter was not really
mended. The rooms were often large and cold,
and being lighted only with a candle or two, no
doubt looked very dreary, while there was not a
fire in the whole house, and no one up but a
yawning servant or two, often very cross at
having been disturbed. The servants, however,
in noblemen’s houses, he also told me, were
frequently kind to him, giving him bread and
butter, and sometimes bread and jam; and as his
master generally had a glass of raw spirit handed
to him, the boy usually had a sip when his
employer had “knocked off his glass.” His
employer, indeed, sometimes said, “O, <i>he’s</i> better
without it; it’ll only larn him to drink, like it
did me;” but the servant usually answered, “O,
here, just a thimblefull for him.”</p>

<p>The usual dress of the climbing-boy&mdash;as I have
learned from those who had worn it themselves,
and, when masters, had provided it for their
boys&mdash;was made of a sort of strong flannel, which
many years ago was called chimney-sweepers’
cloth; but my informant was not certain whether
this was a common name for it or not, he only
remembered having heard it called so. He remembered,
also, accompanying his master to do
something to the flues in a church, then (1817)
hung with black cloth, as a part of the national
mourning for the Princess Charlotte of Wales,
and he thought it seemed very like the chimney-sweepers’
cloth, which was dark coloured when
new. The child-sweep wore a pair of cloth
trowsers, and over that a sort of tunic, or tight
fitting shirt with sleeves; sometimes a little
waistcoat and jacket. This, it must be borne in
mind, was only the practice among the best
masters (who always had to find their apprentices
in clothes); and was the practice among them
more and more in the later period of the climbing
process, for householders began to inquire as to
what sort of trim the boys employed on their
premises appeared in. The poorer or the less
well-disposed masters clad the urchins who
climbed for them in any old rags which their
wives could piece together, or in any low-priced
garment “picked up” in such places as Rosemary-lane.
The fit was no object at all. These ill-clad
lads were, moreover, at one time the great majority.
The clothes were usually made “at home” by the
women, and in the same style, as regarded the
seams, &amp;c., as the sacks for soot; but sometimes
the work was beyond the art of the sweeper’s
wife, and then the aid of some poor neighbour
better skilled in the use of her scissors and needle,
or of some poor tailor, was called in, on the well-known
terms of “a shilling (or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) a day, and
the grub.”</p>

<p>The cost of a climbing-boy’s dress, I was informed,
varied, when new, according to the material
of which it was made, from 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
independently of the cost of making, which, in
the hands of a tailor who “whipped the cat” (or
went out to work at his customer’s houses), would
occupy a day, at easy labour, at a cost of 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
(or less) in money, and the “whip-cat’s” meals,
perhaps another 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, beer included. As to
the cost of a sweeper’s second-hand clothing it is
useless to inquire; but I was informed by a now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
thriving master, that when he was about twelve
years old his mistress bought him a “werry tidy
jacket, as seemed made for a gen’leman’s son,” in
Petticoat-lane, one Sunday morning, for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
while other things, he said, were “in proportionate.”
Shoes and stockings are not included in
the cost of the little sweeper’s apparel; and they
were, perhaps, always bought second-hand. A
few of the best masters (or of those wishing to
stand best in their customers’ regards), who sent
their boys to church or to Sunday schools, had
then a non-working attire for them; either a
sweeper’s dress of jacket and trowsers, unsoiled
by soot, or the ordinary dress of a poor lad.</p>

<p>The street appearance of the present race of
sweepers, all adults, may every here and there bear
out Charles Lamb’s dictum, that grown sweepers
are by no means attractive. Some of them are
broad-shouldered and strongly-built men, who,
as they traverse the streets, sometimes look as
grim as they are dingy. The chimney-scavager
carries the implement of his calling propped on
his shoulder, in the way shown in the daguerreotype
which I have given. His dress is usually a
jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers of dark-coloured
corduroy; or instead of a jacket a waistcoat
with sleeves. Over this when at work the sweeper
often wears a sort of blouse or short smock-frock
of coarse strong calico or canvas, which protects
the corduroy suit from the soot. In this description
of the sweeper’s garb I can but speak of those
whose means enable them to attain the comfort of
warm apparel in the winter; the poorer part of
the trade often shiver shirtless under a blouse
which half covers a pair of threadbare trowsers.
The cost of the corduroy suit I have mentioned
varies, I was told by a sweeper, who put it
tersely enough, “from 20<i>s.</i> <i>slop</i>, to 40<i>s.</i> <i>slap</i>.”
The average runs, I believe, from 28<i>s.</i> to 33<i>s.</i>, as
regards the better class of the sweepers.</p>

<p>The <i>diet of the journeymen sweepers and the
apprentices</i>, and sometimes of their working employer,
was described to me as generally after the
following fashion. My informant, a journeyman,
calculated what his food “stood his master,” as
he had once “kept hisself.”</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>On Sundays the fare was better. They then
sometimes had a bit of “prime fat mutton” taken
to the oven, with “taturs to bake along with it;”
or a “fry of liver, if the old ’oman was in a good
humour,” and always a pint of beer apiece.
Hence, as some give their men beer, the average
amount of 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> weekly, which I have given
as the cost of the “board” to the masters, is
made up. The drunken single-handed master-men,
I am told, live on beer and “a bite of anything
they can get.” I believe there are few
complaints of inefficient food.</p>

<p>The food provided by the large or high master
sweepers is generally of the same kind as the
master and his family partake of; among this
class the journeymen are tolerably well provided
for.</p>

<p>In the lower-class sweepers, however, the food is
not so plentiful nor so good in kind as that provided
by the high master sweepers. The expense
of keeping a man employed by a large master
sometimes ranges as high as 8<i>s.</i> a week, but the
average, I am told, is about 6<i>s.</i> per week; while
those employed by the low-class sweepers average
about 5<i>s.</i> a week. The cost of their lodging may
be taken at from 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> a week extra.</p>

<p>The sweepers in general are, I am assured, fond
of oleaginous food; fat broth, fagots, and what is
often called “greasy” meat.</p>

<p>They are considered <i>a short-lived people</i>, and
among the journeymen, the masters “on their own
hook,” &amp;c., few old men are to be met with. In
one of the reports of the Board of Health, out
of 4312 deaths among males, of the age of 15
and upwards, the mortality among the sweepers,
masters and men, was 9, or one in 109 of the
whole trade. As the calculation was formed,
however, from data supplied by the census
of 1841, and on the Post Office Directory,
it supplies no reliable information, as I shall
show when I come to treat of the nightmen.
Many of these men still suffer, I am told, from
the chimney-sweeper’s cancer, which is said to
arise mainly from uncleanly habits. Some
sweepers assure me that they have vomited balls
of soot.</p>

<p><i>As to the abodes of the master sweepers</i>, I can
supply the following account of two. The soot,
I should observe, is seldom kept long, rarely a
month, on the premises of a sweeper, and is in the
best “concerns” kept in cellars.</p>

<p>The localities in which many of the sweepers
reside are the “lowest” places in the district.
Many of the houses in which I found the lower
class of sweepers were in a ruinous and filthy condition.
The “high-class” sweepers, on the other
hand, live in respectable localities, often having
back premises sufficiently large to stow away their
soot.</p>

<p>I had occasion to visit the house of one of the
persons from whom I obtained much information.
He is a master in a small way, a sensible man,
and was one of the few who are teetotallers. His
habitation, though small&mdash;being a low house only
one story high&mdash;was substantially furnished with
massive mahogany chairs, table, chests of drawers,
&amp;c., while on each side of the fire-place, which
was distinctly visible from the street over a hall
door, were two buffets, with glass doors, well
filled with glass and china vessels. It was a wet
night, and a fire burned brightly in the stove, by
the light of which might be seen the master of
the establishment sitting on one side, while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
wife and daughter occupied the other; a neighbour
sat before the fire with his back to the door, and
altogether it struck me as a comfortable-looking
evening party. They were resting and chatting
quietly together after the labour of the day, and
everything betokened the comfortable circumstances
in which the man, by sobriety and industry,
had been able to place himself. Yet this
man had been a climbing-boy, and one of the
unfortunates who had lost his parents when a
child, and was apprenticed by the parish to this
business. From him I learned that his was not
a solitary instance of teetotalism (I have before
spoken of another); that, in fact, there
were some more, and one in particular, named
Brown, who was a good speaker, and devoted
himself during his leisure hours at night in
advocating the principles which by experience he
had found to effect such great good to himself;
but he also informed me that the majority of the
others were a drunken and dissipated crew, sunk
to the lowest degree of misery, yet recklessly
spending every farthing they could earn in the
public-house.</p>

<p>Different in every respect was another house
which I visited in the course of my inquiries, in
the neighbourhood of <span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;-</span>street, Bethnal-green.
The house was rented by a sweeper, a master on
his own account, and every room in the place was let
to sweepers and their wives or women, which, with
these men, often signify one and the same thing.
The inside of the house looked as dark as a coal-pit;
there was an insufferable smell of soot,
always offensive to those unaccustomed to it;
and every person and every thing which met
the eye, even to the caps and gowns of the women,
seemed as if they had just been steeped in
Indian ink. In one room was a sweep and his
woman quarrelling. As I opened the door I
caught the words, “I’m <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> if I has it any
longer. I’d see you <span class="lock">b&mdash;&mdash;y</span> well <span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> first,
and you knows it.” The savage was intoxicated,
for his red eyes flashed through his sooty mask
with drunken excitement, and his matted hair,
which looked as if it had never known a comb,
stood out from his head like the whalebone ribs
of his own machine. “<span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;y</span> Bet,” as he
called her, did not seem a whit more sober than
her man; and the shrill treble of her voice
was distinctly audible till I turned the corner
of the street, whither I was accompanied by
the master of the house, to whom I had been recommended
by one of the fraternity as an intelligent
man, and one who knew “a thing or two.”
“You see,” he said, as we turned the corner,
“there isn’t no use a talkin’ to them ere fellows&mdash;they’re
all tosticated now, and they doesn’t care
nothink for nobody; but they’ll be quiet enough
to-morrow, ’cept they yarns somethink, and if they
do then they’ll be just as bad to-morrow night.
They’re a awful lot, and nobody ill niver do
anythink with them.” This man was not by any
means in such easy circumstances as the master first
mentioned. He was merely a man working for
himself, and unable to employ any one else in the
business; as is customary with some of these
people, he had taken the house he had shown
me to let to lodgers of his own class, making
something by so doing; though, if his own account
be correct, I’m at a loss to imagine how
he contrived even to get his rent. From him I
obtained the following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I was a climbing-boy, and sarved a rigler
printiceship for seven years. I was out on my
printiceship when I was fourteen. Father was a
silk-weaver, and did all he knew to keep me from
being a sweep, but I would be a sweep, and
nothink else.” [This is not so very uncommon a
predilection, strange as it may seem.] “So father,
when he saw it was no use, got me bound printice.
Father’s alive now, and near 90 years of
age. I don’t know why I wished to be a sweep,
’cept it was this&mdash;there was sweeps always lived
about here, and I used to see the boys with lots
of money a tossin’ and gamblin’, and wished to
have money too. You see they got money where
they swept the chimneys; they used to get 2<i>d.</i> or
3<i>d.</i> for theirselves in a day, and sometimes 6<i>d.</i>
from the people of the house, and that’s the
way they always had plenty of money. I niver
thought anythink of the climbing; it wasn’t so
bad at all as some people would make you believe.
There are two or three ways of climbing. In
wide flues you climb with your elbows and your
legs spread out, your feet pressing against the
sides of the flue; but in narrow flues, such as
nine-inch ones, you must slant it; you must have
your sides in the angles, it’s wider there, and go
up just that way.” [Here he threw himself into
position&mdash;placing one arm close to his side, with
the palm of the hand turned outwards, as if
pressing the side of the flue, and extending the
other arm high above his head, the hand apparently
pressing in the same manner.] “There,”
he continued, “that’s slantin’. You just put
yourself in that way, and see how small you
make yourself. I niver got to say stuck myself,
but a many of them did; yes, and were taken
out dead. They were smothered for want of air,
and the fright, and a stayin’ so long in the flue;
you see the waistband of their trowsers sometimes
got turned down in the climbing, and in narrow
flues, when not able to get it up, then they stuck.
I had a boy once&mdash;we were called to sweep a
chimney down at Poplar. When we went in he
looked up the flues, ‘Well, what is it like?’ I
said. ‘Very narrow,’ says he, ‘don’t think I
can get up there;’ so after some time we gets on
top of the house, and takes off the chimney-pot,
and has a look down&mdash;it was wider a’ top, and I
thought as how he could go down. ‘You had
better buff it, Jim,’ says I. I suppose you know
what that means; but Jim wouldn’t do it, and
kept his trowsers on. So down he goes, and
gets on very well till he comes to the shoulder of
the flue, and then he couldn’t stir. He shouts
down, ‘I’m stuck.’ I shouts up and tells him
what to do. ‘Can’t move,’ says he, ‘I’m stuck
hard and fast.’ Well, the people of the house got
fretted like, but I says to them, ‘Now my boy’s
stuck, but for Heaven’s sake don’t make a word
of noise; don’t say a word, good or bad, and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
see what I can do.’ So I locks the door, and
buffs it, and forces myself up till I could reach
him with my hand, and as soon as he got his
foot on my hand he begins to prize himself up, and
gets loosened, and comes out at the top again.
I was stuck myself, but I was stronger nor he,
and I manages to get out again. Now I’ll be
bound to say if there was another master there
as would kick up a row and a-worrited, that ere
boy ’ud a niver come out o’ that ere flue alive.
There was a many o’ them lost their lives in that
way. Most all the printices used to come from the
‘House’ (workhouse.) There was nobody to care
for them, and some masters used them very bad. I
was out of my time at fourteen, and began to get
too stout to go up the flues; so after knockin’
about for a year or so, as I could do nothink else,
I goes to sea on board a man-o’-war, and was
away four year. Many of the boys, when they
got too big and useless, used to go to sea in them
days&mdash;they couldn’t do nothink else. Yes, many
of them went for sodgers; and I know some
who went for Gipsies, and others who went for
play-actors, and a many who got on to be swell-mobsmen,
and thieves, and housebreakers, and
the like o’ that ere. There ain’t nothink o’ that
sort a-goin’ on now since the Ack of Parliament.
When I got back from sea father asked me to
larn his business; so I takes to the silk-weaving
and larned it, and then married a weaveress, and
worked with father for a long time. Father was
very well off&mdash;well off and comfortable for a
poor man&mdash;but trade was good then. But it got
bad afterwards, and none on us was able to live
at it; so I takes to the chimney-sweeping again.
<i>A man might manage to live somehow at the
sweeping, but the weaving was o’ no use.</i> It
was the furrin silks as beat us all up, that’s the
whole truth. Yet they tells us as how they was
a-doin’ the country good; but they may tell that
to the marines&mdash;the sailors won’t believe it&mdash;not
a word on it. I’ve stuck to the sweeping ever
since, and sometimes done very fair at it; but
since the Ack there’s so many leeks come to it
that I don’t know how they live&mdash;they must be
eatin’ one another up.</p>

<p>“Well, since you ask then, I can tell you that
our people don’t care much about law; they
don’t understand anythink about politics much;
they don’t mind things o’ that ere kind. They
only minds to get drunk when they can.
Some on them fellows as you seed in there
niver cleans theirselves from one year’s end to
the other. They’ll kick up a row soon enough,
with Chartists or anybody else. I thinks them
Chartists are a weak-minded set; they was
too much a frightened at nothink,&mdash;a hundred o’
them would run away from one blue-coat, and
that wasn’t like men. I was often at Chartist
meetings, and if they’d only do all they said
there was a plenty to stick to them, for there’s a
somethink wants to be done very bad, for everythink
is a-gettin’ worser and worser every day.
I used to do a good trade, but now I don’t yarn a
shilling a day all through the year (?). I may walk
at this time three or four miles and not get a
chimney to sweep, and then get only a sixpence
or threepence, and sometimes nothink. It’s a
starvin’, that’s what it is; there’s so much
‘querying’ a-goin’ on. Querying? that’s what
we calls under-working<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. If they’d all fix a
riglar price we might do very well still. I’m
50 years of age, or thereabouts. I don’t know
much about the story of Mrs. Montague; it was
afore my time. I heard of it though. I heard my
mother talk about it; she used to read it out of
books; she was a great reader&mdash;none on ’em
could stand afore her for that. I was often at the
dinner&mdash;the masters’ dinner&mdash;that was for the
boys; but that’s all done away long ago, since
the Ack of Parliament. I can’t tell how many
there was at it, but there’s such a lot it’s impossible
to tell. How could any one tell all the
sweeps as is in London? I’m sure I can’t, and
I’m sure nobody else can.”</p>

<p>Some years back the sweepers’ houses were
often indicated by an elaborate sign, highly
coloured. A sweeper, accompanied by a “chummy”
(once a common name for the climbing-boy,
being a corruption of chimney), was depicted
on his way to a red brick house, from
the chimneys of which bright yellow flames were
streaming. Below was the detail of the things
undertaken by the sweep, such as the extinction
of fires in chimneys, the cleaning of
smoke-jacks, &amp;c., &amp;c. A few of these signs,
greatly faded, may be seen still. A sweeper, who
is settled in what is accounted a “genteel neighbourhood,”
has now another way of making his
calling known. He leaves a card whenever he
hears of a new comer, a tape being attached, so
that it can be hung up in the kitchen, and thus
the servants are always in possession of his
address. The following is a customary <span class="lock">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Chimneys swept by the improved machine,
much patronized by the Humane Society.</p>

<p>“W. H., Chimney Sweeper and Nightman,
1, &mdash;&mdash; Mews, in returning thanks to the inhabitants
of the surrounding neighbourhood for the
patronage he has hitherto received, begs to inform
them that he sweeps all kinds of chimneys
and flues in the best manner.</p>

<p>“W. H., attending to the business himself,
cleans smoke-jacks, cures smoky coppers, and extinguishes
chimneys when on fire, with the
greatest care and safety; and, by giving the
strictest personal attendance to business, performs
what he undertakes with cleanliness and punctuality,
whereby he hopes to ensure a continuance
of their favours and recommendations.</p>

<p>“Clean cloths for upper apartments. Soot-doors
to any size fixed. Observe the address,
1, &mdash;&mdash; Mews, near &mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>At the top of this card is an engraving of the
machine; at the foot a rude sketch of a nightman’s
cart, with men at work. All the cards I
saw reiterated the address, so that no mistake
might lead the customer to a rival tradesman.</p>

<p><i>As to their politics</i>, the sweepers are somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
similar to the dustmen and costermongers. A
fixed hatred to all constituted authority, which
they appear to regard as the police and the “beaks,”
seems to be the sum total of their principles.
Indeed, it almost assumes the character of a fixed
law, that persons and classes of persons who are
themselves disorderly, and to a certain extent
lawless, always manifest the most supreme contempt
for the conservators of law and order in
every degree. The police are therefore hated
heartily, magistrates are feared and abominated,
and Queen, Lords, and Commons, and every one
in authority, if known anything about, are considered
as natural enemies. A costermonger who
happened to be present while I was making inquiries
on this subject, broke in with this remark,
“The costers is the chaps&mdash;the government can’t
do nothink with them&mdash;they allus licks the government.”
The sweepers have a sovereign contempt
for all Acts of Parliament, because the only Act that
had any reference to themselves “threw open,” as
they call it, their business to all who were needy
enough and who had the capability of availing
themselves of it. Like the “dusties” they are,
I am informed, in their proper element in times
of riot and confusion; but, unlike them, they are,
to a man, Chartists, understanding it too, and
approving of it, not because it would be calculated
to establish a new order of things, but in the
hope that, in the transition from one system to
the other, there might be plenty of noise and riot,
and in the vague idea that in some indefinable
manner good must necessarily accrue to themselves
from any change that might take place.
This I believe to be in perfect keeping with the
sentiments of similar classes of people in every
country in the world.</p>

<p>The journeymen lay by no money when in
work, as a fund to keep them when incapacitated
by sickness, accident, or old age. There are,
however, a few exceptions to the general improvidence
of the class; some few belong to sick and
benefit societies, others are members of burial
clubs. Where, however, this is not the case, and
a sweeper becomes unable, through illness, to continue
his work, the mode usually adopted is to
make a raffle for the benefit of the sufferer;
the same means are resorted to at the death of a
member of the trade. When a chimney-sweeper
becomes infirm through age, he has mostly, if not
invariably, no refuge but the workhouse.</p>

<p><i>The chimney-sweepers generally are regardless
of the marriage ceremony</i>, and when they do
live with a woman it is in a state of concubinage.
These women are always among the lowest of the
street-girls&mdash;such as lucifer-match and orange girls,
some of the very poorest of the coster girls, and
girls brought up among the sweepers. They
are treated badly by them, and often enough left
without any remorse. The women are equally as
careless in these matters as the men, and exchange
one paramour for another with the same levity,
so that there is a promiscuous intercourse continually
going on among them. I am informed
that, among the worst class of sweepers living
with women, not one in 50 is married. To these
couples very few children are born; but I am not
able to state the proportion as compared with
other classes.</p>

<p><i>There are some curious customs among the
London sweepers</i> which deserve notice. Their May-day
festival is among the best known. The most
intelligent of the masters tell me that they
have taken this “from the milkmen’s garland” (of
which an engraving has been given). Formerly, say
they, on the first of May the milkmen of London
went through the streets, performing a sort of
dance, for which they received gratuities from
their customers. The music to which they
danced was simply brass plates mounted on poles,
from the circumference of which plates depended
numerous bells of different tones, according to
size; these poles were adorned with leaves and
flowers, indicative of the season, and may have
been a relic of one of the ancient pageants or
mummeries.</p>

<p>The sweepers, however, by adapting themselves
more to the rude taste of the people, appear to
have completely supplanted the milkmen, who are
now never seen in pageantry. In Strutt’s “Sports
and Pastimes of the People of England,” I find
the following with reference to the milk-<span class="lock">people:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It is at this time,” that is in May, says the
author of one of the papers in the <i>Spectator</i>, “we
see brisk young wenches in the country parishes
dancing round the Maypole. It is likewise on
the first day of this month that we see the ruddy
milkmaid exerting herself in a most sprightly
manner under a pyramid of silver tankards, and,
like the Virgin Tarpeia, oppressed by the costly
ornaments which her benefactors lay upon her.
These decorations of silver cups, tankards, and
salvers, were borrowed for the purpose, and hung
round the milk-pails, with the addition of flowers
and ribands, which the maidens carried upon their
heads when they went to the houses of their customers,
and danced in order to obtain a small
gratuity from each of them. In a set of prints,
called ‘Tempest’s Cries of London,’ there is one
called the ‘Merry Milkmaid,’ whose proper name
was Kate Smith. She is dancing with the milk-pail,
decorated as above mentioned, upon her
head. Of late years the plate, with the other
decorations, were placed in a pyramidical form,
and carried by two chairmen upon a wooden
horse. The maidens walked before it, and performed
the dance without any incumbrance. I
really cannot discover what analogy the silver
tankards and salvers can have to the business of
the milkmaids. I have seen them act with much
more propriety upon this occasion, when, in place
of these superfluous ornaments, they substituted a
cow. The animal had her horns gilt, and was
nearly covered with ribands of various colours
formed into bows and roses, and interspersed with
green oaken leaves and bunches of flowers.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE MILKMAID’S GARLAND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Original of the Sweep’s May-Day Exhibition.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>With reference to the May-day festival of the
sweepers the same author says:&mdash;“The chimney-sweepers
of London have also singled out the
first of May for their festival, at which time they
parade the streets in companies, disguised in
various manners. Their dresses are usually deco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>rated
with gilt paper and other mock fineries;
they have their shovels and brushes in their
hands, which they rattle one upon the other; and
to this rough music they jump about in imitation
of dancing. Some of the larger companies have
a fiddler with them, and a Jack in the Green, as
well as a Lord and Lady of the May, who follow
the minstrel with great stateliness, and dance as
occasion requires. The Jack in the Green is a
piece of pageantry consisting of a hollow frame of
wood or wicker-work, made in the form of a
sugar-loaf, but open at the bottom, and sufficiently
large and high to receive a man. The frame is
covered with green leaves and bunches of flowers,
interwoven with each other, so that the man
within may be completely concealed, who dances
with his companions; and the populace are
mightily pleased with the oddity of the moving
pyramid.”</p>

<p>Since the date of the above, the sweepers
have greatly improved on their pageant, substituting
for the fiddle the more noisy and appropriate
music of the street-showman’s drum and
pipes, and adding to their party several diminutive
imps, no doubt as representatives of the
climbing-boys, clothed in caps, jackets, and
trowsers, thickly covered with party-coloured
shreds. These still make a show of rattling
their shovels and brushes, but the clatter is unheard
alongside the thunders of the drum. In
this manner they go through the various streets
for three days, obtaining money at various places,
and on the third night hold a feast at one of
their favourite public-houses, where all the sooty
tribes resort, and, in company with their wives or
girls, keep up their festivity till the next morning.
I find that this festival is beginning to disappear
in many parts of London, but it still holds its
ground, and is as highly enjoyed as ever, in all the
eastern localities of the metropolis.</p>

<p>It is but seldom that any of the large masters
go out on May-day; this custom is generally confined
to the little masters and their men. The
time usually spent on these occasions is four
days, during which as much as from 2<i>l.</i> to 4<i>l.</i> a
day is collected; the sums obtained on the three
first days are divided according to the several
kinds of work performed. But the proceeds of the
fourth day are devoted to a supper. The average
gains of the several performers on these occasions
are as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>
<p>The share accruing to the boys is often spent
in purchasing some article of clothing for them,
but the money got by the other individuals is
mostly spent in drink.</p>

<p>The sweepers, however, not only go out on
May-day, but likewise on the 5th of November.
On the last Guy-Fawkes day, I am informed,
some of them received not only pence from the
public, but silver and gold. “It was quite a
harvest,” they say. One of this class, who got
up a gigantic Guy Fawkes and figure of the
Pope on the 5th of November, 1850, cleared, I am
informed, 10<i>l.</i> over and above all expenses.</p>

<p>For many years, also, the sweepers were in the
habit of partaking of a public dinner on the 1st
of May, provided for every climbing-boy who
thought proper to attend, at the expense of the
Hon. Mrs. Montagu. The romantic origin of
this custom, from all I could learn on the subject,
is this:&mdash;The lady referred to, at the time a
widow, lost her son, then a boy of tender years.
Inquiries were set on foot, and all London heard
of the mysterious disappearance of the child, but
no clue could be found to trace him out. It was
supposed that he was kidnapped, and the search
at length was given up in despair. A long time
afterwards a sweeper was employed to cleanse the
chimneys of Mrs. Montagu’s house, by Portman-square,
and for this purpose, as was usual at the
time, sent a climbing-boy up the chimney, who
from that moment was lost to him. The child
did not return the way he went up, but it is supposed
that in his descent he got into a wrong flue,
and found himself, on getting out of the chimney,
in one of the bedrooms. Wearied with his labour,
it is said that he mechanically crept between the
sheets, all black and sooty as he was. In this state
he was found fast asleep by the housekeeper. The
delicacy of his features and the soft tones of his
voice interested the woman. She acquainted the
family with the strange circumstance, and, when
introduced to them with a clean face, his voice and
appearance reminded them of their lost child. It
may have been that the hardships he endured at
so early an age had impaired his memory, for he
could give no account of himself; but it was
evident, from his manners and from the ease
which he exhibited, that he was no stranger to
such places, and at length, it is said, the Hon.
Mrs. Montagu recognised in him her long-lost
son. The identity, it was understood, was proved
beyond doubt. He was restored to his rank in
society, and in order the better to commemorate
this singular restoration, and the fact of his
having been a climbing-boy, his mother annually
provided an entertainment on the 1st of May, at
White Conduit House, for all the climbing-boys
of London who thought proper to partake of it.
This annual feast was kept up during the lifetime
of the lady, and, as might be expected, was
numerously attended, for since there were no question
asked and no document required to prove any
of the guests to be climbing-boys, very many of
the precocious urchins of the metropolis used to
blacken their faces for this special occasion.
This annual feast continued, as I have said, as
long as the lady lived. Her son continued it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
only for three or four years afterwards, and then,
I am told, left the country, and paid no further
attention to the matter.</p>

<p>Of the story of the young Montagu, Charles
Lamb has given the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In one of the state-beds at Arundel Castle,
a few years since&mdash;under a ducal canopy (that
seat of the Howards is an object of curiosity to
visitors, chiefly for its beds, in which the late
duke was especially a connoisseur)&mdash;encircled
with curtains of delicatest crimson, with starry
coronets interwoven&mdash;folded between a pair of
sheets whiter and softer than the lap where Venus
lulled Ascanius&mdash;was discovered by chance, after
all methods of search had failed, at noon-day,
fast asleep, a lost chimney-sweeper. The little
creature having somehow confounded his passage
among the intricacies of those lordly chimneys,
by some unknown aperture had alighted upon
this magnificent chamber, and, tired with his
tedious explorations, was unable to resist the
delicious invitement to repose, which he there saw
exhibited; so, creeping between the sheets very
quietly, he laid his black head on the pillow and
slept like a young Howard.”.... “A high
instinct,” adds Lamb, “was at work in the case,
or I am greatly mistaken. Is it probable that a
poor child of that description, with whatever
weariness he might be visited, would have ventured
under such a penalty as he would be taught
to expect, to uncover the sheets of a duke’s bed,
and deliberately to lay himself down between
them, when the rug or the carpet presented an
obvious couch still far above his pretensions?&mdash;is
this probable, I would ask, if the great power of
nature, which I contend for, had not been manifested
within him, prompting to the adventure?
Doubtless, this young nobleman (for such my
mind misgives me he must be) was allured by
some memory not amounting to full consciousness
of his condition in infancy, when he was
used to be lapt by his mother or his nurse in
just such sheets as he there found, into which he
was now but creeping back as into his proper
incubation (<i>incunabula</i>) and resting place. By
no other theory than by his sentiment of a pre-existent
state (as I may call it) can I explain a
deed so venturous.”</p>

<p>There is a strong strain of romance throughout
the stories of the lost and found young Montagu.
I conversed with some sweepers on the subject. The
majority had not so much as heard of the occurrence,
but two who had heard of it&mdash;both climbing-boys
in their childhood&mdash;had heard that the
little fellow was found in his mother’s house. In
a small work, the “Chimney-Sweepers’ Friend,”
got up in aid of the Society for the Supersedence
of Climbing Boys, by some benevolent Quaker
ladies and others (the Quakers having been
among the warmest supporters of the suppression
of climbers), and “arranged” (the word “edited”
not being used) by J. Montgomery, the case of
the little Montagu is not mentioned, excepting in
two or three vague poetical allusions.</p>

<p>The account given by Lamb (although pronounced
apocryphal by some) appears to be the
more probable version; and to the minds of many
is shown to be conclusively authentic, as I understand
that, when Arundel Castle is shown to
visitors, the bed in which the child was found is
pointed out; nor is it likely that in such a place
the story of the ducal bed and the little climbing-boy
would be <i>invented</i>.</p>

<p>The following account was given by the wife
of a respectable man (now a middle-aged woman)
and she had often heard it from her mother, who
passed a long life in the neighbourhood of Mrs.
Montagu’s <span class="lock">residence:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Lady M. had a son of tender years, who was
supposed to have been stolen for the sake of his
clothes. Some time after, there was an occasion
when the sweeps were necessary at Montagu
House. A servant noticed one of the boys, being
at first attracted by his superior manner, and her
curiosity being excited fancied a resemblance in
him to the lost child. She questioned his master
respecting him, who represented that he had found
him crying and without a home, and thereupon
took him in, and brought him up to his trade.
The boy was questioned apart from his master, as
to the treatment he received; his answers were
favourable; and the consequence was, a compensation
was given to the man, and the boy was retained.
All doubt was removed as to his identity.”</p>

<p>The annual feast at “White Condick,” so
agreeable to the black fraternity, was afterwards
continued in another form, and was the origin
of a well-known society among the master
sweepers, which continued in existence till the
abolition of the climbing-boys by Act of Parliament.
The masters and the better class of men
paid a certain sum yearly, for the purpose of binding
the children of the contributors to other trades. In
order to increase the funds of this institution, as
the dinner to the boys at White Conduit House
was an established thing, the masters continued it,
and the boys of every master who belonged to
the society went in a sort of state to the usual
place of entertainment every 1st of May, where
they were regaled as formerly. Many persons
were in the habit of flocking on this day to
White Conduit House to witness the festivities of
the sweepers on this occasion, and usually contributed
something towards the society. As
soon, however, as the Act passed, this also was
discontinued, and it is now one of the legends
connected with the class.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweeping of the Chimneys of Steam-Vessels.</span></h3>

<p>The sweeping of the flues in the boilers of steam-boats,
in the Port of London, and also of land
boilers in manufactories, is altogether a distinct
process, as the machine cannot be used until such
time as the parties who are engaged in this business
travel a long way through the flues, and
reach the lower part of the chimney or funnel
where it communicates with the boilers and receives
the smoke in its passage to the upper air.
The boilers in the large sea-going steamers are
of curious construction; in some large steamers
there are four separate boilers with three furnaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
in each, the flues of each boiler uniting in one
beneath the funnel; immediately beyond the end
of the furnace, which is marked by a little wall
constructed of firebrick to prevent the coals and
fire from running off the firebars, there is a large
open space very high and wide, and which space
after a month’s steaming is generally filled up with
soot, somewhat resembling a snow drift collected
in a hollow, were it not for its colour and the
fact that it is sometimes in a state of ignition; it
is, at times, so deep, that a man sinks to his middle
in it the moment he steps across the firebridge.
Above his head, and immediately over the end of
the furnace, he may perceive an opening in what
otherwise would appear to be a solid mass of iron;
up to this opening, which resembles a doorway,
the sweeper must clamber the best way he can,
and when he succeeds in this he finds himself in a
narrow passage completely dark, but with so strong
a current of air rushing through it from the furnaces
beneath towards the funnel overhead that it
is with difficulty the wick lamp which he carries
in his hand can be kept burning. This passage,
between the iron walls on either side, is lofty
enough for a tall man to stand upright in, but
does not seem at first of any great extent; as he
goes on, however, to what appears the end, he
finds out his mistake, by coming to a sharp turn
which conducts him back again towards the open
space in the centre of the boiler, but which is now
hid from him by the hollow iron walls which on
every side surround him, and within which the
waters boil and seethe as the living flames issuing
from the furnaces rush and roar through these
winding passages; another sharp turn leads back
to the front of the boilers, and so on for seven or
eight turns, backwards and forwards, like the
windings in a maze, till at the last turn a light
suddenly breaks upon him, and, looking up, he
perceives the hollow tube of the funnel, black and
ragged with the adhering soot.</p>

<p>Here, then, the labour of the sweeper commences:
he is armed with a brush and shovel, and
laying down his lamp in a space from which he
has previously shovelled away the soot, which in
many parts of the passage is knee deep, he
brushes down the soot from the sides and roof
of the passage, which being done he shovels it
before him into the next winding; this process he
repeats till he reaches, by degrees, the opening
where he ascended. Whenever the accumulation of
soot is so great that it is likely to block up the
passage in the progress of his work, he wades
through and shovels as much as he thinks necessary
out of the opening into the large space behind
the furnaces, then resumes his work, brushing and
shovelling by turns, till the flues are cleared; when
this is accomplished, he descends, and the fire
bars being previously removed, he shovels the soot,
now all collected together, over the firebridge and
into the ashpit of the furnace; other persons stand
ready in the stoke-hole armed with long iron rakes,
with which they drag out the soot from the ashpits;
and others shovel it into sacks, which they
make fast to tackle secured to the upper deck, by
which they “bowse” it up out of the engine-room,
and either discharge it overboard or put it into boats
preparatory to being taken ashore. In this manner
an immense quantity of soot is removed from
the boilers of a large foreign-going steamer when
she gets into port, after a month or six weeks’
steaming, having burned in that time perhaps 700
or 800 tons of coal: this work is always performed
by the stokers and coal-trimmers in the foreign
ports, who seldom, if ever, get anything extra
for it, although it is no uncommon thing for some
of them to be ill for a week after it.</p>

<p>In the port of London, however, the sweeper
comes into requisition, who, besides going through
the process already described, brings his machine
with him, and is thus enabled to cleanse the
funnel, and to increase the quantity of soot. Some
of the master sweepers, who have the cleansing of
the steam-boats in the river, and the sweeping of
boiler flues are obliged to employ a good many men,
and make a great deal of money by their business.
The use of anthracite coals, however, and
some modern improvements, by which air at a
certain temperature is admitted to certain parts of
the furnace, have in many instances greatly lessened,
if they have not altogether prevented, the
accumulation of soot, by the prevention of smoke;
and it seems quite possible, from the statements
made by many eminent scientific and practical
men who were examined before a select committee
of the House of Commons, presided over by
Mr. Mackinnon, in 1843, that by having properly-constructed
stoves, and a sufficient quantity of
pure air properly admitted, not only less fuel might
be burned, and produce a greater amount of heat,
but soot would cease to accumulate, so that the
necessity for sweepers would be no longer felt,
and there would be no fear of fires from the ignition
of soot in the flues of chimneys; blacks and
smoke, moreover, would take their departure together;
and with them the celebrated London fog
might also, in a great measure, disappear.</p>

<p>The funnels of steamers are generally swept at
from 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per funnel. The Chelsea
steamers are swept by Mr. Allbrook, of Chelsea;
the Continental, by Mr. Hawsey, of Rosemary-lane;
and the Irish and Scotch steamers, by Mr.
Tuff, who resides in the East London district.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Ramoneur” Company.</span></h3>

<p>The Patent Ramoneur Company demands, perhaps,
a special notice. It was formed between four and
five years ago, and has now four stations: one
in Little Harcourt-street, Bryanstone-square; another
in New-road, Sloane-street; a third in
Charles-place, Euston-square; and the fourth in
William-street, Portland-town.</p>

<p>“This Company has been formed,” the prospectus
stated, “for the purpose of cleansing
chimneys with the Patent Ramoneur Machine,
and introducing various other improvements in
the business of chimney sweeping. Chimneys are
daily swept with this machine where others have
failed.”</p>

<p>The Company charge the usual prices, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the men employed have been brought up as
sweepers. The patent machine is thus <span class="lock">described:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Patent Ramoneur Machine consists of
four brushes, forming a square head, which, by
means of elastic springs, contracts or expands,
according to the space it moves in; the rods
attached to this head or brush are supplied at
intervals with a universal spring-joint, capable of
turning even a right angle, and the whole is surmounted
with a double revolving ball, having also
a universal spring-joint, which leads the brush
with certainty into every corner, cleansing its
route most perfectly.”</p>

<p>The recommendation held out to the public is,
that the patented chimney-machine sweeps cleaner
than that in general use, and for the reasons
assigned; and that, being constructed with more
and better springs, it is capable of “turning even
a right angle,” which the common machine often
leaves unswept. This was and is commonly
said of the difference between the cleansing of the
chimney by a climbing-boy and that effected by
the present mechanical appliances in general use&mdash;the
boy was “better round a corner.”</p>

<p>The patent machines now worked in London
are fifteen in number, and fifteen men are thus
employed. Each man receives as a weekly wage,
always in money, 14<i>s.</i>, besides a suit of clothes
yearly. The suit consists of a jacket, waistcoat,
and trousers, of dark-coloured corduroy; also a
“frock” or blouse, to wear when at work, and a
cap; the whole being worth from 35<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i>
This payment is about equivalent to that received
weekly by the journeymen in the regular
or honourable trade; for although higher in
nominal amount as a weekly remuneration, the
Ramoneur operatives are not allowed any perquisites
whatever. The resident or manager at
each station is also a working chimney-sweeper
for the Company, and at the same rate as the
others, his advantage being that he lives rent-free.
At one station which I visited, the resident had
two comfortable-looking up-stairs’-rooms (the
stations being all in small streets), where he and
his wife lived; while the “cellar,” which was
indeed but the ground floor, although somewhat
lower than the doorstep, was devoted to business
purposes, the soot being stored there. It was
boarded off into separate compartments, one being
at the time quite full of soot. All seemed as
clean and orderly as possible. The rent of those
two rooms, unfurnished, would not be less than
4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> a week, so that the resident’s payment
may be put at about 50<i>l.</i> a year. The patent-machine
operatives sweep, on an average, the same
number of chimneys each, as a master chimney-sweeper’s
men in a good way of business in the
ordinary trade.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Brisk and Slack Seasons, and the
Casual Trade among the Chimney-Sweepers.</span></h3>

<p>As among the rubbish-carters in the unskilled,
and the tailors and shoemakers of the skilled
trades, the sweepers’ trade also has its slackness
and its briskness, and from the same cause&mdash;the
difference in the <i>seasons</i>. The seasons affecting
the sweepers’ trade are, however, the <i>natural</i>
seasons of the year, the recurring summer and
winter, while the seasons influencing the employment
of West-end tailors are the <i>arbitrary</i> seasons
of fashion.</p>

<p>The chimney-sweepers’ <i>brisk</i> season is in the
winter, and especially at what may be in the
respective households the periods of the resumption
and discontinuance of sitting-room fires.</p>

<p>The sweepers’ seasons of briskness and slackness,
indeed, may be said then to be ruled by the
thermometer, for the temperature causes the increase
or diminution of the number of fires, and
consequently of the production of soot. The
thermometrical period for fires appears to be from
October to the following April, both inclusive
(seven months), for during that season the temperature
is below 50°. I have seen it stated, and
I believe it is merely a statement of a fact, that
at one time, and even now in some houses, it was
customary enough for what were called “great
families” to have a fixed day (generally Michaelmas-day,
Sept. 29) on which to commence fires in
the sitting-rooms, and another stated day (often
May-day, May 1) on which to discontinue them,
no matter what might be the mean temperature,
whether too warm for the enjoyment of a fire, or
too cold comfortably to dispense with it. Some
wealthy persons now, I am told&mdash;such as call
themselves “economists,” while their servants and
dependants apply the epithet “mean”&mdash;defer fires
until the temperature descends to 42°, or from
November to March, both inclusive, a season of
only five months.</p>

<p>As this question of the range of the thermometer
evidently influences the seasons, and
therefore, the casual labour of the sweepers, I will
give the following interesting account of the
changing temperature of the metropolis, month by
month, the information being derived from the
observations of 25 years (1805 to 1830), by
Mr. Luke Howard. The average temperature
appears to <span class="lock">be:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>London, I may further state, is 2&frac12; degrees
warmer than the country, especially in winter,
owing to the shelter of buildings and the multiplicity
of the fires in the houses and factories. In
the summer the metropolis is about 1&frac14; degree
hotter than the country, owing to want of free
air in London, and to a cause little thought about&mdash;the
reverberations from narrow streets. In
spring and autumn, however, the temperature of
both town and country is nearly equal.</p>

<p>In London, moreover, the nights are 11·3
degrees colder than the days; in the country they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
are 15·4 degrees colder. The extreme ranges of
the temperature in the day, in the capital, are from
20° to 90°. The thermometer <i>has</i> fallen below
zero in the night time, but not frequently.</p>

<p>In London the hottest months are 28 degrees
warmer than the coldest; the temperature of
July, which is the hottest month, being 63·1;
and that of January, the coldest month, 35·1
degrees.</p>

<p>The month in which there are the greatest
number of extremes of heat and cold is January.
In February and December there are (generally
speaking) only two such extreme variations, and
five in July; through the other months, however,
the extremes are more diffused, and there are
only two spring and two autumn months (April
and June&mdash;September and November), which are
not exposed to great differences of temperature.</p>

<p>The mean temperature assumes a rate of increase
in the different months, which may be
represented by a curve nearly equal and parallel
with one representing the progress of the sun in
declination.</p>

<p>Hoar-frosts occur when the thermometer is
about 39°, and the dense yellow fogs, so peculiar
to London, are the most frequent in the months of
November, December, and January, whilst the
temperature ranges below 40°.</p>

<p>The busy season in the chimney-sweepers’ trade
commences at the beginning of November, and
continues up to the month of May; during the
remainder of the year the trade is “slack.”
When the slack season has set in nearly 100 men
are thrown out of employment. These, as well as
many of the single-handed masters, resort to other
kinds of employment. Some turn costermongers,
others tinkers, knife-grinders, &amp;c., and others
migrate to the country and get a job at haymaking,
or any other kind of unskilled labour.
Even during the brisk season there are upwards
of 50 men out of employment; some of these
occasionally contrive to get a machine of their
own, and go about “knulling,”&mdash;getting a job
where they can.</p>

<p>Many of the master sweepers employ in the
summer months only two journeymen, whereas
they require three in the winter months; but this,
I am informed, is not the general average, and that
it will be more correct to compute it for the whole
trade, in the proportion of two and a half to two.
We may, then, calculate that one-fourth of the
entire trade is displaced during the slack season.</p>

<p>This, then, may be taken as the extent of casual
labour, with all the sufferings it entails upon improvident,
and even upon careful working-men.</p>

<p>A youth casually employed as a sweeper gave
the following account:&mdash;“I jobs for the sweeps
sometimes, sir, as I’d job for anybody else, and if
you have any herrands to go, and will send me,
I’ll be unkimmon thankful. I haven’t no father
and don’t remember one, and mother might do
well but for the ruin (gin). I calls it ‘ruin’ out
of spite. No, I don’t care for it myself. I like
beer ten to a farthing to it. She’s a ironer,
sir, a stunning good one, but I don’t like to
talk about her, for she might yarn a hatful of
browns&mdash;3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day; and when she has pulled
up for a month or more it’s stunning is the
difference. I’d rather not be asked more about
that. Her great fault against me is as I won’t
settle. I was one time put to a woman’s shoemaker
as worked for a ware’us. He was a
relation, and I was to go prentice if it suited.
But I couldn’t stand his confining ways, and I’m
sartain sure that he only wanted me for some tin
mother said she’d spring if all was square. He
was bad off, and we lived bad, but he always pretended
he was going to be stunning busy. So I
hooked it. I’d other places&mdash;a pot-boy’s was
one, but no go. None suited.</p>

<p>“Well, I can keep myself now by jobbing,
leastways I can partly, for I have a crib in a
corner of mother’s room, and my rent’s nothing,
and when she’s all right <i>I’m</i> all right, and she
gets better as I grows bigger, I think. Well, I
don’t know what I’d like to be; something like
a lamp-lighter, I think. Well, I look out for
sweep jobs among others, and get them sometimes.
I don’t know how often. Sometimes three mornings
a week for one week; then none for a month.
Can any one live by jobbing that way for the
sweeps? No, sir, nor get a quarter of a living;
but it’s a help. I know some very tidy sweeps
now. I’m sure I don’t know what they are in
the way of trade. O, yes, now you ask that, I
think they’re masters. I’ve had 6<i>d.</i> and half-a-pint
of beer for a morning’s work, jobbing like.
I carry soot for them, and I’m lent a sort of
jacket, or a wrap about me, to keep it off my
clothes&mdash;though a Jew wouldn’t sometimes look
at ’em&mdash;and there’s worser people nor sweeps.
Sometimes I’ll get only 2<i>d.</i> or 3<i>d.</i> a day for
helping that way, a carrying soot. I don’t know
nothing about weights or bushels, but I know I’ve
found it &mdash;&mdash; heavy.</p>

<p>“The way, you see, sir, is this here: I meets a
sweep as knows me by sight, and he says, ‘Come
along, Tom’s not at work, and I want you. I
have to go it harder, so you carry the soot to our
place to save my time, and join me again at No.
39.’ That’s just the ticket of it. Well, no; I
wouldn’t mind being a sweep for myself with my
own machine; but I’d rather be a lamp-lighter.
How many help sweeps as I do? I can’t at all
say. No, I don’t know whether it’s 10, or 20,
or 100, or 1000. I’m no scholard, sir, that’s one
thing. But it’s very seldom such as me’s wanted
by them. I can’t tell what I get for jobbing for
sweeps in a year. I can’t guess at it, but it’s
not so much, I think, as from other kinds of jobbing.
Yes, sir, I haven’t no doubt that the t’others
as jobs for sweeps is in the same way as me. I
think I may do as much as any of ’em that
way, quite as much.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the “Leeks” among the Chimney-Sweepers.</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Leeks</i> are men who have not been brought
up to the trade of chimney sweeping, but have
adopted it as a speculation, and are so called from
their entering <i>green</i>, or inexperienced, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
business. There are I find as many as 200 leeks
altogether among the master chimney-sweepers of
the metropolis. Of the “high masters” the
greater portion are leeks&mdash;no less than 92 out of
106. I was informed that one of this class was
formerly a solicitor, others had been ladies’ shoemakers,
and others master builders and bricklayers.
Among the lower-class sweepers who
have taken to this trade, there are dustmen,
scavagers, bricklayers’ labourers, soldiers, costermongers,
tinkers, and various other unskilled
labourers.</p>

<p>The leeks are regarded with considerable dislike
by the class of masters who have been regularly
brought up to the business, and served their
apprenticeships as climbing-boys. These look upon
the leeks as men who intrude upon, or interfere
with, their natural and, as they account it, legal
rights&mdash;declaring that only such as have been
brought up to the business should be allowed to
establish themselves in it as masters. The chimney-sweepers,
as far as I can learn, have never possessed
any guild, or any especial trade regulations,
and this opinion of their rights being invaded by
the leeks arises most probably from their knowledge
that during the climbing-boy system every
lad so employed, unless the son of his employer,
was obliged to be apprenticed.</p>

<p>This jealousy towards the leeks does not at all
affect the operative sweepers, as some of these leeks
are good masters, and among them, perhaps, is to
be found the majority of the capitalists of the
chimney-sweeping trade, paying the best wages,
and finding their journeymen proper food and
lodging. Into whatever district I travelled I
heard the operative chimney-sweepers speak highly
in favour of some of the leeks.</p>

<p>Many of the small masters, however, said “it
were a shame” for persons who had never known
the horrors of climbing to come into the trade and
take the bread out of the mouths of those who
had undergone the drudgery of the climbing
system; and there appears to be some little justice
in their remarks.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of machines into the
chimney-sweeping trade the masters have increased
considerably. In 1816 there were 200
masters, and now there are 350. Before the machines
were introduced, the high master sweepers
or “great gentlemen,” as they were called, numbered
only about 20; their present number is
106. The lower-class and master-men sweepers, on
the other hand, were, under the climbing system,
from 150 to 180 in number; but at present there
are as many as 240 odd. The majority of these
fresh hands are “leeks,” not having been bred to
the business.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Inferior Chimney-Sweepers&mdash;the
“Knullers” and “Queriers.”</span></h3>

<p>The majority of occupations in all civilized communities
are divisible into two distinct classes, the
employers and the employed. The employers are
necessarily capitalists to a greater or less extent,
providing generally the materials and implements
necessary for the work, as well as the subsistence
of the workmen, in the form of wages and appropriating
the proceeds of the labour, while the
employed are those who, for the sake of the
present subsistence supplied to them, undertake to
do the requisite work for the employer. In some
few trades these two functions are found to be
united in the same individuals. The class
known as peasant proprietors among the cultivators
of the soil are at once the labourers
and the owners of the land and stock. The cottiers,
on the other hand, though renting the land
of the proprietor, are, so to speak, peasant farmers,
tilling the land for themselves rather than doing
so at wages for some capitalist tenant. In handicrafts
and manufactures the same combination of
functions is found to prevail. In the clothing
districts the domestic workers are generally their
own masters, and so again in many other branches
of production. These trading operatives are
known by different names in different trades. In
the shoe trade, for instance, they are called
“chamber-masters,” in the “cabinet trade” they
are termed “garret-masters,” and in “the cooper’s
trade” the name for them is “small trading-masters.”
Some style them “master-men,” and
others, “single-handed masters.” In all occupations,
however, the master-men are found to be especially
injurious to the interests of the entire body
of both capitalists and operatives, for, owing to the
limited extent of their resources, they are obliged
to find a market for their work, no matter at what
the sacrifice, and hence by their excessive competitions
they serve to lower the prices of the
trade to a most unprecedented extent. I have as
yet met with no occupation in which the existence
of a class of master-men has worked well for the interest
of the trade, and I have found many which
they have reduced to a state of abject wretchedness.
It is a peculiar circumstance in connection
with the master-men that they abound only in
those callings which require a small amount of
capital, and which, consequently, render it easy
for the operative immediately on the least disagreement
between him and his employer to pass
from the condition of an operative into that of a
trading workman. When among the fancy cabinet-makers
I had a statement from a gentleman, in
Aldersgate-street, who supplied the materials to
these men, that a fancy cabinet-maker, the manufacturer
of writing-desks, tea-caddies, ladies’ work-boxes,
&amp;c., could begin, and did begin, business on
less than 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> A youth had just then bought
materials of him for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to “begin on a small
desk,” stepping at once out of the trammels of
apprenticeship into the character of a master-man.
Now this facility to commence business on a man’s
own account is far greater in the chimney-sweepers’
trade than even in the desk-makers’, for the one
needs no previous training, while the other does.</p>

<p>Thus when other trades, skilled or unskilled,
are depressed, when casual labour is with a mass
of workpeople more general than constant labour,
they naturally inquire if they “cannot do
better at something else,” and often resort to such
trades as the chimney-sweepers’. It is open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
all, skilled and unskilled alike. Distress, a desire
of change, a vagabond spirit, a hope to “better
themselves,” all tend to swell the ranks of the
single-handed master chimney-sweepers; even
though these men, from the casualties of the
trade in the way of “seasons,” &amp;c., are often
exposed to great privations.</p>

<p>There are in all 147 single-handed masters,
who are thus distributed throughout the <span class="lock">metropolis:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Southwark (17), Chelsea (11), Marylebone,
Shoreditch, and Whitechapel (each 9), Hackney,
Stepney, and Lambeth (each 8), St. George’s-in-the-East
(7), Rotherhithe (6), St. Giles’ and
East London (each 5), Bethnal-green, Bermondsey,
Camberwell, and Clapham (each 4), St.
Pancras, Islington, Walworth, and Greenwich
(each 3), St. James’s (Westminster), Holborn,
Clerkenwell, St. Luke’s, Poplar, Westminster,
West London, City, Wandsworth, and Woolwich
(each 1); in all, 147.</p>

<p>Thus we perceive, that the single-handed
masters abound in the suburbs and poorer districts;
and it is generally in those parts where
the lower rate of wages is paid that these men
are found to prevail. Their existence appears to
be at once the cause and the consequence of the
depreciation of the labour.</p>

<p>Of the single-handed masters there is a sub-class
known by the name of “knullers” or “queriers.”</p>

<p>The <i>knullers</i> were formerly, it is probable,
known as knellers. The Saxon word <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Cnyllan</i>
is to knell (to knull properly), or sound a bell, and
the name “knuller” accordingly implies the
sounder of a bell, which has been done, there
can be no doubt, by the London chimney-sweepers
as well as the dustmen, to announce their presence,
and as still done in some country parts. One informant
has known this to be the practice at the
town of Hungerford in Berkshire. The bell was
in size between that of the muffin-man and the
dustman.</p>

<p>The knuller is also styled a “<i>querier</i>,” a name
derived from his making <i>inquiries</i> at the doors of
the houses as to whether his services are required
or are likely to be soon required, calling even
where they know that a regular resident chimney-sweeper
is employed. The men go along calling
“sweep,” more especially in the suburbs, and if
asked “Are you Mr. So-and-So’s man?” answer
in the affirmative, and may then be called in to
sweep the chimneys, or instructed to come in the
morning. Thus they receive the full charge of an
established master, who, for the sake of his
character and the continuance of his custom, must
do his work properly; while if such work be
done by the knuller, it will be hurriedly and
therefore badly done, as all work is, in a general
way, when done under false pretences.</p>

<p>Some of the sharpest of these men, I am told,
have been reared up as sweepers; but it appears,
although it is a matter difficult to ascertain with
precision, the majority have been brought up to
some generally unskilled calling, as scavagers,
costermongers, tinkers, bricklayers’ labourers,
soldiers, &amp;c. The knullers or queriers are almost
all to be found among the lower class chimney-sweepers.
There are, from the best information
to be obtained, from 150 to 200 of them. Not only
do they scheme for employment in the way I
have described, but some of them call at the
houses of both rich and poor, boldly stating that
they had been <i>sent</i> by Mr. &mdash;&mdash; to sweep the
flues. I was informed by several of the master
sweepers, that many of the fires which happen in
the metropolis are owing to persons employing
these “knullers,” “for,” say the high masters,
“they scamp the work, and leave a quantity of
soot lodged in the chimney, which, in the event
of a large fire being kept in the range or grate,
ignites.” This opinion as to the fires in the
chimneys being caused by the scamped work of
the knullers must be taken with some allowance.
Tradesmen, whose established business is thus, as
they account it, usurped, are naturally angry with
the usurpers.</p>

<p>There is another evil, so say the regular
masters, resulting from the employment of the
knullers&mdash;the losses accruing to persons employing
them, as “they take anything they can lay
their hands upon.”</p>

<p>This, also, is a charge easy to make, but not
easy to refute, or even to sift. One master chimney-sweeper
told me that when chimneys are
swept in rich men’s houses there is almost always
some servant in attendance to watch the sweepers.
If the rich, I am told, be watchful under these
circumstances, the poor are more vigilant.</p>

<p>The distribution of the knullers or queriers is
as follows:&mdash;Southwark (17), Chelsea and St.
Giles’ (11 each), Shoreditch and Whitechapel (10
each), Lambeth (9), Marylebone, Stepney and
Walworth (8 each), St. George’s in the East and
Woolwich (7 each), Islington and Hackney (6
each), East London, Rotherhithe, and Greenwich
(5 each), Paddington, St. Pancras, East London,
Rotherhithe and Greenwich (5 each), Paddington,
St. Pancras, Bethnal Green, Bermondsey, and
Clapham (4 each), Westminster, St. Martin’s,
Holborn, St. Luke’s, West London, Poplar, and
Camberwell (3 each); St. James’s (Westminster),
Clerkenwell, City of London, and Wandsworth
(2 each), Kensington (1); in all, 183.</p>

<p>Like the single-handed men the knullers abound
in the suburbs. I endeavoured to find a knuller
who had been a skilled labourer, and was referred
to one who, I was told, had been a working
plumber, and a “good hand at spouts.” I found
him a doggedly ignorant man; he saw no good,
he said, in books or newspapers, and “wouldn’t
say nothing to me, as I’d told him it would be
printed. He wasn’t a going to make a holy-show
[so I understood him] of <i>his</i>-self.”</p>

<p>Another knuller (to whom I was referred by a
master who occasionally employed him as a journeyman)
gave me the following account. He was
“doing just middling” when I saw him, he said,
but his look was that of a man who had known
privations, and the soot actually seemed to bring
out his wrinkles more fully, although he told me he
was only between 40 and 50 years old; he believed
he was not 46.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was hard brought up, sir,” he said; “ay,
them as’ll read your book&mdash;I mean them readers
as is well to do&mdash;cannot fancy how hard. Mother
was a widow; father was nobody knew where;
and, poor woman, she was sometimes distracted
that a daughter she had before her marriage, went
all wrong. She was a washerwoman, and slaved
herself to death. She died in the house [workhouse]
in Birmingham. I can read and write a
little. I was sent to a charity school, and when I
was big enough I was put ’prentice to a gunsmith
at Birmingham. I’m master of the business
generally, but my perticler part is a gun lock-filer.
No, sir, I can’t say as ever I liked it; nothing but
file file all day. I used to wish I was like the
free bits o’ boys that used to beg steel filings
of me for their fifth of November fireworks. I
never could bear confinement. It’s made me
look older than I ought, I know, but what can a poor
man do? No, I never cared much about drinking.
I worked in an iron-foundry when I was out of
my time. I had a relation that was foreman
there. Perhaps it might be that, among all the
dust and heat and smoke and stuff, that made me
a sweep at last, for I was then almost or quite as
black as a sweep.</p>

<p>“Then I come up to London; ay, that must
be more nor 20 years back. O, I came up to
better myself, but I couldn’t get work either at
the gun-makers&mdash;and I fancy the London masters
don’t like Birmingham hands&mdash;nor at the iron-foundries,
and the iron-foundries is nothing in
London to what they is in Staffordshire and
Warwickshire; nothing at all, they may say what
they like. Well, sir, I soon got very bad off.
My togs was hardly to call togs. One night&mdash;and
it was a coldish night, too&mdash;I slept in the park,
and was all stiff and shivery next morning. As
I was wandering about near the park, I walked
up a street near the Abbey&mdash;King-street, I think
it is&mdash;and there was a picture outside a public-house,
and a writing of men wanted for the East
India Company’s Service. I went there again
in the evening, and there was soldiers smoking
and drinking up and down, and I ’listed at once.
I was to have my full bounty when I got to the
depôt&mdash;Southampton I think they called it. Somehow
I began to rue what I’d done. Well, I
hardly can tell you why. O, no; I don’t say I
was badly used; not at all. But I had heard of
snakes and things in the parts I was going to, and
I gently hooked it. I was a navvy on different
rails after that, but I never was strong enough for
that there work, and at last I couldn’t get any
more work to do. I came back to London; well,
sir, I can’t say, as you ask, why I came to London
’stead of Birmingham. I seemed to go natural
like. I could get nothing to do, and Lord! what
I suffered! I once fell down in the Cut from
hunger, and I was lifted into Watchorn’s, and he
said to his men, ‘Give the poor fellow a little
drop of brandy, and after that a biscuit; the best
things he can have.’ He saved my life, sir. The
people at the bar&mdash;they see’d it was no humbug&mdash;gathered
7&frac12;<i>d.</i> for me. A penny a-piece from
some of Maudslay’s men, and a halfpenny from a
gent that hadn’t no other change, and a poor
woman as I was going away slipt a couple of
trotters into my hand.</p>

<p>“I slept at a lodging-house, then, in Baldwin’s-gardens
when I had money, and one day in Gray’s
inn-lane I picked up an old gent that fell in the
middle of the street, and might have been run
over. After he’d felt in all his pockets, and
found he was all right, he gave me 5<i>s.</i> I knew a
sweep, for I sometimes slept in the same house, in
King-street, Drury-lane; and he was sick, and
was going to the big house. And he told me all
about his machines, that’s six or seven years back,
and said if I’d pay 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> down, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week, if I couldn’t pay more, I might have his
machine for 20<i>s.</i> I took it at 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and paid
him every farthing. That just kept him out of
the house, but he died soon after.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been a sweep ever since. I’ve had
to shift as well as I could. I don’t know that
I’m what you call a Nuller, or a Querier. Well,
if I’m asked if I’m anybody’s man, I don’t like
to say ‘no,’ and I don’t like to say ‘yes;’ so I
says nothing if I can help it. Yes, I call at
houses to ask if anything’s wanted. I’ve got a
job that way sometimes. If they took me for
anybody’s man, I can’t help that. I lodge with
another sweep which is better off nor I am, and
pay him 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a week for a little stair-head
place with a bed in it. I think I clear 7<i>s.</i> a
week, one week with another, but that’s the outside.
I never go to church or chapel. I’ve
never got into the way of it. Besides, I wouldn’t

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Fires of London.</span></h3>

<p>Connected with the subject of chimney sweeping
is one which attracts far less of the attention of
the legislature and the public than its importance
would seem to demand: I mean the fires in the
metropolis, with their long train of calamities,
such as the loss of life and of property. These
calamities, too, especially as regards the loss of
property, are almost all endured by the poor,
the destruction of whose furniture is often the
destruction of their whole property, as insurances
are rarely effected by them; while the wealthier
classes, in the case of fires, are not exposed to the
evils of houselessness, and may be actually
gainers by the conflagration, through the sum for
which the property was insured.</p>

<p>“The daily occurrence of fires in the metropolis,”
say the Board of Health, “their extent,
the number of persons who perish by them, the
enormous loss of property they occasion, the prevalence
of incendiarism, the apparent apathy with
which such calamities are regarded, and the
rapidity with which they are forgotten, will hereafter
be referred to as evidence of a very low
social condition and defective administrative organization.
These fires, it was shown nearly a century
ago, when the subject of insurance was debated
in Parliament, were frequently caused from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
not having chimneys swept in proper time.” I
am informed that a chimney may be on fire for
many days, unknown to the inmates of the house,
and finally break out in the body of the building
by its getting into contact with some beam or
wood-work. The recent burning of Limehouse
Church was occasioned by the soot collected in
the flue taking fire, and becoming red hot, when
it ignited the wood-work in the roof. The flue,
or pipe, was of iron.</p>

<p>From a return made by Mr. Braidwood of
the houses and properties destroyed in the metropolis
in the three years ending in 1849 inclusive,
it appears that the total number was 1111: of
contents destroyed (which, being generally insured
separately, should be kept distinct) there were
1013. The subjoined table gives the particulars
as to the proportion insured and <span class="lock">uninsured:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Here, then, we perceive that there are, upon an
average of 17 years, no less than 770 “fires” per
annum, that is to say, 29 houses in every 10,000
are discovered to be on fire every year; and about
one-fourth of these are uninsured. In the year
1833 the total number of fires was only 458, or
20 in every 10,000 inhabited houses, whilst, in
1849, the number had gradually progressed to
838, or 28 in every 10,000 houses.</p>

<p>Here, then, we find that while the greatest proportion
of fires are caused by accidents with candles,
about one-ninth of the fires above mentioned arise
from foul flues, or 75 out of 665, a circumstance
which teaches us the usefulness of the class of labourers
of whom we have been lately treating.</p>

<p>It would seem that a much larger proportion of
the fires are wilfully produced than appear in the
above table.</p>

<p>The Board of Health, in speaking of incendiarism
in connection with insurance, <span class="lock">report:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Inquiries connected with measures for the improvement
of the population have developed the
operation of insurances, in engendering crimes
and calamities; negatively, by weakening natural
responsibilities and motives to care and forethought;
positively, by temptations held out to
the commission of crime in the facility with which
insurance money is usually obtainable.</p>

<p>“The <i>steady increase</i> in the number of fires
in the metropolis, whilst our advance in the arts
gives means for their diminution, is ascribable
mainly to the operation of these two causes, and
to the division and weakening of administrative
authority. From information on which we can
rely, we feel assured that the crime of incendiarism
for the sake of insurance money exists to
a far greater extent than the public are aware of.”</p>

<p>Mr. Braidwood has expressed his opinion that
only one-half of the property in the metropolis is
insured, not as to numbers of property, but as to
value; but the proportion of insured and uninsured
houses could not be ascertained.</p>

<p>Mr. Baddeley, the inspector to the Society for
the Protection of Life from Fire, who had given
attention to the subject for the last 30 years, gave
the Board the following account of the increase of
<span class="lock">fires:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>During this period there has been a great increase
in the number of dwellings, but this has
been chiefly in suburban places, where fires rarely
occur.</p>

<p>“The frequency of fires,” it is further stated,
“led Mr. Payne, the coroner of the City of
London, to revive the exercise of the coroner’s
function of inquiring into the causes of fires;
most usefully. Out of 58 inquests held by him
(in the City of London and the borough of
Southwark, which comprise only one-eighteenth
of the houses of the metropolis) since 1845, it
appears that, 8 were proved to be wilful; 27
apparently accidental; and 23 from causes unknown,
including suspicious causes. The proportion
of ascertained wilful fires was, therefore, 23
per cent.; which gives strong confirmation to the
indications presented by the statistical returns as
to the excess of insured property burnt above uninsured.”</p>

<p>The at once mean and reckless criminality of
arson, by which a man exposes his neighbours to
the risk of a dreadful death, which he himself
takes measures to avoid, has long, and on many
occasions, gone unpunished in London. The
insurance companies, when a demand is made upon
them for a loss through fire, institute an inquiry,
carried on quietly by their own people. The
claimant is informed, if sufficient reasons for such
a step appear, that from suspicious circumstances,
which had come to the knowledge of the company,
the demand would not be complied with,
and that the company would resist any action for
the recovery of the money. The criminal becomes
alarmed, he is afraid of committing himself, and
so the matter drops, and the insurance companies,
not being required to pay the indemnification, are
satisfied to save their money, and let the incendiarism
remain unnoticed or unpunished. Mr.
Payne, the coroner, has on some occasions strongly
commented on this practice as one which showed
the want of a public prosecutor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few words as regards the means of extinction
and help at fires.</p>

<p>Upwards of two years ago the Commissioners
of Police instructed their officers to note the time
which elapsed between the earliest alarm of fire
and the arrival of the first engine. Seventeen
fires were noted, and the average duration of time
before the fire-brigade or any parochial or local
fire-engine, reached the spot, was 36 minutes.
Two or three of these fires were in the suburbs; so
that in this crowded city, so densely packed with
houses and people, fifteen fires raged unchecked
for more than half-an-hour.</p>

<p>There are in the metropolis, not including the
more distant suburbs, 150 public fire stations,
with engines provided under the management of
the parochial authorities. The fire-brigade has
but seventeen stations on land, and two on the
river, which are, indeed, floating engines, one
being usually moored near Southwark-bridge, the
other having no stated place, being changed in its
locality, as may be considered best. In the course
of three years, the term of the official inquiry,
the engines of the fire-brigade reached on the
average the place where a fire was raging <i>thirty-five</i>
times as the earliest means of assistance,
when the parochial engines did the same only in
the proportion of <i>two</i> to the thirty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. Braidwood, the director of the fire-brigade,
stated, when questioned on the subject with a view
to a report to be laid before Parliament, that “the
average time of an engine turning out with horses
was from three to seven minutes.” The engines
are driven at the rate of ten miles an hour along
the streets, which, in the old coaching days, was
considered the “best royal mail pace.” Indeed,
there have been frequent complaints of the
rapidity with which the fire-engines are driven,
and if the drivers were not skilful and alert, it
would really amount to recklessness.</p>

<p>“Information of the breaking out of a fire,” it
is stated in the report, “will be conveyed to the
station of the brigade at the rate of about five
miles an hour: thus in the case of the occurrence of
a fire within a mile of the station, the intelligence
may be conveyed to the station in about twelve
minutes; the horses will be put to, and the
engine got out into the street in about five
minutes on the average; it traverses the mile in
about six minutes; and the water has to be got
into the engine, which will occupy about five
minutes, making, under the most favourable circumstances
for such a distance, 28 minutes, or for
a half-mile distance, an average of not less than
20 minutes.”</p>

<p>The average distance of the occurring fires
from a brigade station were, however, during a
period of three years, terminating in 1850, upwards
of a mile. One was five miles, several
four miles, more were two miles, and a mile and
a half, while the most destructive fires were at an
average distance of a mile and three quarters.
Thus it was impossible for a fire-brigade to give
assistance as soon as assistance was needed, and,
under other circumstances, might have been rendered.
And all this damage may and does very
often result from what seems so trifling a neglect
as the non-sweeping of a chimney.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Baddeley, an engineer, and a high
authority on this subject, has stated that he had
attended fires for 30 years in London, and that, of
838 fires which took place in 1849, two-thirds
might have been easily extinguished had there
been an immediate application of water. In some
places, he said, delay originated from the turn-cocks
being at wide intervals, and some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
companies objecting to let any but their own
servants have the command of the main-cocks.</p>

<p>The Board of Health have recommended the
formation of a series of street-water plugs within
short distances of each other, the water to be constantly
on at high pressure night and day, and the
whole to be under the charge of a trained body
of men such as compose the present fire-brigade,
provided at appointed stations with every necessary
appliance in the way of hose, pipes, ladders, &amp;c.
“The hose should be within the reach,” it is
urged in the report, “fixed, and applied on an
average of not more than five minutes from the
time of the alarm being given; that is to say, in
less than one-fourth of the time within which fire-engines
are brought to bear under existing arrangements,
and with a still greater proportionate
diminution of risks and serious accidents.”</p>

<p>Nor is this mode of extinguishing fires a mere
experiment. It is successfully practised in some
of the American cities, Philadelphia among the
number, and in some of our own manufacturing
towns. Mr. Emmott, the engineer and manager
of the Oldham Water-works, has described the
practice in that town on the occurrence of <span class="lock">fires:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In five cases out of six, the hose is pushed
into a water-plug, and the water thrown upon a
building on fire, for the average pressure of water
in this town is 146 feet; by this means our fires
are generally extinguished even before the heavy
engine arrives at the spot. The hose is much
preferred to the engine, on account of the speed
with which it is applied, and the readiness with
which it is used, for one man can manage a hose,
and throw as much water on the building on fire
as an engine worked by many men. On this
account we very rarely indeed use the engines, as
they possess no advantage whatever over the
hose.”</p>

<p>When the city of Hamburgh was rebuilt two
or three years back, after its destruction by fire,
it was rebuilt chiefly under the direction of Mr.
W. Lindley, the engineer, and, as far as Mr.
Lindley could accomplish, on sanitary principles,
such as the abolition of cesspools. The arrangements
for the surface cleansing of the streets by
means of the hose and jet and the water-plugs,
are made available for the extinction of fires, and
with the following results, as communicated by
Mr. <span class="lock">Lindley:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Have there been fires in buildings in Hamburgh
in the portion of the town rebuilt?&mdash;Yes,
repeatedly. They have all, however, been put
out at once. If they had had to wait the usual
time for engines and water, say 20 minutes or
half an hour, these might all have led to extensive
conflagrations.</p>

<p>“What has been the effect on insurance?&mdash;The
effect of the rapid extinction of fires has
brought to light to the citizens of Hamburgh, the
fact that the greater proportion of their fires are
the work of incendiaries, for the sake of the insurance
money. A person is absent; smoke is
seen to exude; the alarm of fire is given, and the
door is forced open, the jet applied, and the fire
extinguished immediately. Case after case has
occurred, where, upon the fire being extinguished,
the arrangements for the spread of the fire are
found and made manifest. Several of this class
of incendiaries for the insurance money are now
in prison. The saving of money alone, by the
prevention of fires, would be worth the whole expense
of the like arrangement in London, where
it is well known that similar practices prevail extensively.”</p>

<p>The following statement was given by Mr.
Quick, an engineer, on this <span class="lock">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“After the destruction of the terminus of the
South Western Railway by fire, I recommended
them to have a 9-inch main, with 3-inch outlets
leading to six stand-pipes, with joining screws for
hose-pipes to be attached, and that they should
carry a 3-inch pipe of the same description up
into each floor, so that a hose might be attached
in any room where the fire commenced.</p>

<p>“In how many minutes may the hose be
attached?&mdash;There is only the time of attaching
the hose, which need be nothing like a minute.
I have indeed recommended that a short length
of hose with a short nozzle or branch should be
kept attached to the cock, so that the cock has
only to be turned, which is done in an instant.</p>

<p>“It appears that fire-engines require 26 men to
work each engine of two 7 inch barrels, to produce
a jet of about 50 feet high. The arrangement
carried out, at your recommendation, with
six jets, is equivalent to keeping six such engines,
and the power of 156 men, in readiness to act at
all times, night and day, at about a minute’s
notice, for the extinction of fires?&mdash;It will give a
power more than equal to that number of men;
for the jets given off from a 20-inch main will be
much more regular and powerful, and will deliver
more water than could be delivered by any
engine. The jets at that place would be 70 feet
high.”</p>

<p>The system of roof-cisterns, which was at one
time popular as a means of extinction, has been
found, it appears, on account of their leakage and
diffusion of damp, to be but sorry contrivances,
and have very generally been discontinued. Mr.
Holme, a builder in Liverpool, gives the following,
even under the circumstances, amusing account
of a fire where such a cistern was <span class="lock">provided:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The owner of a cotton kiln, which had been
repeatedly burnt, took it into his head to erect a
large tank in the roof. His idea was, that when
a fire occurred, they should have water at hand;
and when the fire ascended, it would burn the
wooden tank, and the whole of the contents
being discharged on the fire like a cataract, it
would at once extinguish it. Well, the kiln
again took fire; the smoke was so suffocating,
that nobody could get at the internal pipe, and
the whole building was again destroyed. But
what became of the tank? It could not burn,
because it was filled with water; consequently, it
boiled most admirably. No hole was singed in
its side or bottom; it looked very picturesque,
but it was utterly useless.”</p>

<p>The necessity of almost immediate help is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
shown in the following statement by Mr. Braidwood,
when consulted on the subject of fire-escapes,
which under the present system are not
considered sufficiently <span class="lock">effective:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Taking London to be six miles long and
three miles broad, to have anything like an
efficient system of fire-escapes, it would be necessary
to have one with a man to attend it within a
quarter of a mile of each house, as assistance, to
be <i>of any use, must generally be rendered within
five minutes after the alarm is given</i>. To do this
the stations must be within a quarter of a mile of
each other (as the escapes must be taken round
the angles of the streets): 253 stations would
thus be required and as many men.</p>

<p>“At present scaling ladders are kept at all the
engine stations, and canvas sheets also at some
of them; several lives have been saved by them;
but the distance of the stations from each other
renders them applicable only in a limited number
of instances.”</p>

<p>The engines of the fire-brigade throw up about
90 gallons a minute. Their number is about
100. The cost of a fire-engine is from 60<i>l.</i> to
100<i>l.</i>, and the hose, buckets, and general apparatus,
cost nearly the same amount.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sewermen and Nightmen of
London.</span></h3>

<p>We now come to the consideration of the last
of the several classes of labourers engaged in the
removal of the species of refuse from the metropolis.
I have before said that the public refuse
of a town consists of two <span class="lock">kinds:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>I. The street-refuse.</li>
<li>II. The house-refuse.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of each of these kinds there are two <span class="lock">species:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>A. The dry.</li>
<li>B. The wet.</li>
</ul>


<p>The dry street-refuse consists, as we have seen,
of the refuse earth, bricks, mortar, oyster-shells,
potsherds, and pansherds.</p>

<p>And the dry house-refuse of the soot and ashes
of our fires.</p>

<p>The wet street-refuse consists, on the other
hand, of the mud, slop, and surface water of our
public thoroughfares.</p>

<p>And the wet house-refuse, of what is familiarly
known as the “slops” of our residences, and the
liquid refuse of our factories and slaughterhouses.</p>

<p>We have already collected the facts in connection
with the three first of these subjects. We
have ascertained the total amount of each of these
species of refuse which have to be annually removed
from the capital. We have set forth the
aggregate number of labourers who are engaged
in the removal of it, as well as the gross sum that
is paid for so doing, showing the individual earnings
of each of the workmen, and arriving, as
near as possible, at the profits of their employers,
as well as the condition of the employed. This
has been done, it is believed, for the first time in
this country; and if the subject has led us into
longer discussions than usual, the importance of
the matter, considered in a sanitary point of view,
is such that a moment’s reflection will convince
us of the value of the inquiry&mdash;especially in
connection with a work which aspires to embrace
the whole of the offices performed by the labourers
of the capital of the British Empire.</p>

<p>It now but remains for us to complete this
novel and vast inquiry by settling the condition
and earnings of the men engaged in the removal of
the last species of public refuse. I shall consider,
first, the aggregate quantity of wet house-refuse
that has to be annually removed; secondly, the
means adopted for the removal of it; thirdly, the
cost of so doing; and lastly, the number of men
engaged in this kind of work, as well as the
wages paid to them, and the physical, intellectual,
and moral condition in which they exist, or, more
properly speaking, are allowed to remain.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Of the Wet House-Refuse of London.</span></h4>

<p>All house-refuse of a liquid or semi-liquid character
is <i>wet</i> refuse. It may be called semi-liquid
when it has become mingled with any solid substance,
though not so fully as to have lost its property
of fluidity, its natural power to flow along
a suitable inclination.</p>

<p>Wet house-refuse consists of the “slops” of
a household. It consists, indeed, of <i>all</i> waste
water, whether from the supply of the water
companies, or from the rain-fall collected on the
roofs or yards of the houses; of the “suds” of
the washerwomen, and the water used in every
department of scouring, cleansing, or cooking. It
consists, moreover, of the refuse proceeds from the
several factories, dye-houses, &amp;c.; of the blood
and other refuse (not devoted to Prussian blue
manufacture or sugar refining) from the butchers’
slaughter-houses and the knackers’ (horse slaughterers’)
yards; as well as the refuse fluid from
all chemical processes, quantities of chemically
impregnated water, for example, being pumped, as
soon as exhausted, from the tan-pits of Bermondsey
into the drains and sewers. From the
great hat-manufactories (chiefly also in Bermondsey
and other parts of the Borough) there is
a constant flow of water mixed with dyes and
other substances, to add to the wet refuse of
London.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that <i>all</i> the water consumed
or wasted in the metropolis must form a portion of
the total sum of the wet refuse.</p>

<p>There is, however, the exception of what is
used for the watering of gardens, which is absorbed
at once by the soil and its vegetable products;
we must also exclude such portion of
water as is applied to the laying of the road and
street dust on dry summer days, and which forms
a part of the street mud or “mac” of the scavager’s
cart, rather than of the sewerage; and we
must further deduct the water derived from the
street plugs for the supply of the fire-engines,
which is consumed or absorbed in the extinction
of the flames; as well as the water required for
the victualling of ships on the eve of a voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
when such supply is not derived immediately from
the Thames.</p>

<p>The quantity of water required for the diet, or
beverage, or general use of the population; the
quantity consumed by the maltsters, distillers,
brewers, ginger-beer and soda-water makers, and
manufacturing chemists; for the making of tea,
coffee, or cocoa; and for drinking at meals (which
is often derived from pumps, and not from the
supplies of the water companies);&mdash;the water
which is thus consumed, in a prepared or in a
simple state, passes into the wet refuse of the
metropolis in another form.</p>

<p>Now, according to reports submitted to Parliament
when an improved system of water-supply
was under consideration, the daily supply of water
to the metropolis is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The reader will find the details of this subject
at p. <a href="#Page_203">203</a> of the present volume. I recapitulate
the results here to save the trouble of reference,
and briefly to present the question under one head.</p>

<p>Of course the rain which ultimately forms a
portion of the gross wet refuse of London, can be
only such as falls on that part of the metropolitan
area which is occupied by buildings or
streets. What falls upon fields, gardens, and all
open ground, is absorbed by the soil. But a large
proportion of the rain falling upon the streets, is
either absorbed by the dry dust, or retained in
the form of mud; hence that only which falls on the
house-tops and yards can be said to contribute
largely to the gross quantity of wet refuse poured
into the sewers. The streets of London appear to
occupy one-tenth of the entire metropolitan area,
and the houses (estimating 300,000 as occupying
upon an average 100 square yards each<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>) another
tithe of the surface. The remaining 92 square
miles out of the 115 now included in the Registrar-General’s
limits (which extend, it should be
remembered, to Wandsworth, Lewisham, Bow,
and Hampstead), may be said to be made up of
suburban gardens, fields, parks, &amp;c., where the
rain-water would soak into the earth. We have,
then, only two-tenths of the gross rain-fall, or
7,700,000,000 gallons, that could possibly appear
in the sewers, and calculating one-third of this to
be absorbed by the mud and dust of the streets,
we come to the conclusion that the total quantity
of rain-water entering the sewers is, in round
numbers, 5,000,000,000 gallons per annum.</p>

<p>Reckoning, therefore, 5,000,000,000 gallons
to be derived from the annual rain-fall, it appears
that the yearly supply of water, from all
sources, to be accounted for among the wet house-refuse
is, in round numbers, 24,000,000,000
gallons.</p>

<p>The refuse water from the factories need not be
calculated separately, as its supply is included in
the water mechanically supplied, and the loss
from evaporation in boiling, &amp;c., would be perfectly
insignificant if deducted from the vast
annual supply, but 350,000,000 gallons have been
allowed for this and other losses.</p>

<p>There is still another source of the supply of
wet house-refuse unconnected either with the
rain-fall or the mechanical supply of water&mdash;I
mean such proportion of the blood or other refuse
from the butchers’ and knackers’ premises as is
washed into the sewers.</p>

<p>Official returns show that the yearly quantity
of animals sold in Smithfield <span class="lock">is&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The blood flowing from a slaughtered bullock,
whether killed according to the Christian or the
Jewish fashion, amounts, on an average, to 20
quarts; from a sheep, to 6 or 7 quarts; from a
pig, 5 quarts; and the same quantity from a calf.
The blood from a horse slaughtered in a knackers’
yard is about the same as that from a bullock.
This blood used to bring far higher prices to the
butcher than can be now realized.</p>

<p>In the evidence taken by a Select Committee of
the House of Commons in 1849, concerning
Smithfield-market, Mr. Wyld, of the Fox and
Knot-yard, Smithfield, stated that he slaughtered
about 180 cattle weekly. “We have a sort of
well made in the slaughterhouse,” he said, “which
receives the blood. I receive about 1l. a week
for it; it goes twice a day to Mr. Ton’s, at Bow
Common. We used to receive a good deal more
for it.” Even the market for blood at Mr. Ton’s,
is, I am informed, now done away with. He was
a manufacturer of artificial manure, a preparation
of night-soil, blood, &amp;c., baked in what may be
called “cakes,” and exported chiefly to our sugar-growing
colonies, for manure. His manure yard
has been suppressed.</p>

<p>I am assured, on the authority of experienced
butchers, that at the present time fully three-fourths
of the blood from the animals slaughtered
in London becomes a component part of the wet
refuse I treat of, being washed into the sewers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
The more wholesale slaughterers, now that blood
is of little value (9 gallons in Whitechapel-market,
the blood of two beasts&mdash;less by a gallon&mdash;can be
bought for 3<i>d.</i>), send this animal refuse down the
drains of their premises in far greater quantities
than was formerly their custom.</p>

<p>Now, reckoning only three-fourths of the blood
from the cattle slaughtered in the metropolis,
to find its way into the sewers, we have, according
to the numbers above given, the following yearly
<span class="lock">supply:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This is merely the blood from the animals sold
in Smithfield-market, the lambs not being included
in the return; while a great many pigs and calves
are slaughtered by the London tradesmen, without
their having been shown in Smithfield.</p>

<p>The ordure from a slaughtered bullock is, on an
average, from &frac12; to &frac34; cwt. Many beasts yield one
cwt.; and cows “killed full of grass,” as much
as two cwt. Of this excrementitious matter, I am
informed, about a fourth part is washed into the
sewers. In sheep, calves, and pigs, however,
there is very little ordure when slaughtered, only
3 or 4 lbs. in each as an average.</p>

<p>Of the number of horses killed there is no
official or published account. One man familiar
with the subject calculated it at 100 weekly. <i>All</i>
the blood from the knackers’ yards is, I am told,
washed into the sewers; consequently its yearly
amount will be 26,000 gallons.</p>

<p>But even this is not the whole of the wet house-refuse
of London.</p>

<p>There are, in addition, the excreta of the
inhabitants of the houses. These are said to average
&frac14; lb. daily per head, including men, women, and
children.</p>

<p>It is estimated by Bousingault, and confirmed
by Liebig, that each individual produces &frac14; lb. of
solid excrement and 1&frac14; lb. of liquid excrement
per day, making 1&frac12; lb. each, or 150 lbs. per 100
individuals, of semi-liquid refuse from the water-closet.
“But,” says the Surveyor of the Metropolitan
Commission of Sewers, “there is other
refuse resulting from culinary operations, to be
conveyed through the drains, and the whole may
be about 250 lbs. for 100 persons.”</p>

<p>The more fluid part of this refuse, however, is
included in the quantity of water before given, so
that there remains only the more solid excrementitious
matter to add to the previous total. This,
then, is &frac14; lb. daily and individually; or from the
metropolitan population of nearly 2,500,000 a
daily supply of 600,000 lbs., rather more than
267 tons; and a yearly aggregate for the whole
metropolis of 219,000,000 lbs., or very nearly
about 100,000 tons.</p>

<p>From the foregoing account, then, the following
is shown to be</p>

the Metropolis.</i></h4>

<p>Hence we may conclude that the more fluid
portion of the wet house-refuse of London amounts
to 24,000,000,000 gallons per annum; and that
altogether it weighs, in round numbers, about
240,000,000,000 lbs., or 100,000,000 tons.</p>

<p>As these refuse products are not so much
matters of trade or sale as other commodities, of
course less attention has been given to them, in
the commercial attributes of weight and admeasurement.
I will endeavour, however, to present
an uniform table of the whole great mass of metropolitan
wet house-refuse in cubic inches.</p>

<p>The imperial standard gallon is of the capacity
of 277·274 cubic inches; and estimating the solid
excrement spoken of as the ordinary weight of
earth, or of the soil of the land, at 18 cubic feet
the ton, we have the following result, calculating
in round <span class="lock">numbers:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Means of Removing the Wet
House-refuse.</span></h3>

<p>Whether this mass of filth be, zymotically, the
cause of cholera, or whether it be (as cannot
be questioned) a means of agricultural fertility,
and therefore of national wealth, it <i>must</i> be removed.
I need not dilate, in explaining a necessity
which is obvious to every man with uncorrupted
physical senses, and with the common moral sense
of decency.</p>

<p>“Dr. Paley,” it is said, in a recent Report to the
Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, “gave to
Burckhardt and other travellers a set of instructions
as to points of observation of the manners
and conditions of the populations amongst whom
they travelled. One of the leading instructions
was to observe how they disposed of their excreta,
for what they did with that showed him what
men were; he also inquired what structure they
had to answer the purpose of a privy, and what
were their habits in respect to it. This information
Dr. Paley desired, not for popular use, but for
himself, for he was accustomed to say, that the
facts connected with that topic gave him more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
information as to the real condition and civilisation
of a population than most persons would be aware
of. It would inform him of their real habits of
cleanliness, of real decency, self-respect, and connected
moral habits of high social importance. It
would inform him of the real state of police, and
of local administration, and much of the general
government.</p>

<p>“The human ordure which defiles the churches,
the bases of public edifices and works of art in
Rome and Naples, and the Italian cities, gives
more sure indications of the real moral and social
position of the Italian population than any impressions
derived from the edifices and works of
art themselves.</p>

<p>“The subject, in relation to which the Jewish
lawgiver gave most particular directions, is one on
which the serious attention and labour of public
administrators may be claimed.”</p>

<p>The next question, is&mdash;<i>How</i> is the wet house-refuse
to be removed?</p>

<p>There are two <span class="lock">ways:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. One is, to transport it to a river, or some
powerfully current stream by a series of
ducts.</p>

<p>2. The other is, to dig a hole in the neighbourhood
of the house, there collect the
wet refuse of the household, and when
the hole or pit becomes full, remove the
contents to some other part.</p></div>

<p>In London the most obvious means of getting
rid of a nuisance is to convey it into the Thames.
Nor has this been done in London only. In Paris
the Seine is the receptacle of the sewage, but,
comparatively, to a much smaller extent than in
London. The fæcal deposits accumulated in the
houses of the French capital are drained into
“fixed” and “moveable” cesspools. The contents
of both these descriptions of cesspools (of which I
shall give an account when I treat of the cesspool
system) are removed periodically, under the direction
of the government, to large receptacles, called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiries</i>, at Montfaucon, and the Forest of Bondy,
where such refuse is made into portable manure.
The evils of this system are not a few; but the
river is spared the greater pollution of the Thames.
Neither is the Seine swayed by the tide as is the
Thames, for in London the very sewers are
affected by the tidal influence, and are not to be
entered until some time before or after high-water.
I need not do more, for my present inquiry, than
allude to the Liffy, the Clyde, the Humber, and
others of the rivers of the United Kingdom, being
used for purposes of sewerage, as channels to
carry off that of which the law prohibits the
retention.</p>

<p>Of the folly, not to say wickedness, of this
principle, there can be no doubt. The vegetation
which gives, demands food. The grass will wither
without its fitting nutriment of manure, as the
sheep would perish without the pasturage of the
grass. Nature, in temperate and moist climates,
is, so to speak, her own manurer, her own restorer.
The sheep, which are as wild and active
as goats, manure the Cumberland fells in which
they feed. In the more cultivated sheep-walks
(or, indeed, in the general pasturage) of the
northern and some of the midland counties,
women, with a wooden implement, may be continually
seen in the later autumn, or earlier and
milder winter, distributing the “stercoraceous
treasure,” as Cowper calls it, which the animals,
to use the North Yorkshire word, have “dropped,”
as well as any extraneous manure which may
have been spread for the purpose. As population
and the demand for bread increase, the need of
extraneous manures also increases; and Nature in
her beneficence has provided that the greater the
consumption of food, the greater shall be the
promoters of its reproduction by what is loathsome
to man, but demanded by vegetation. Liebig,
as I shall afterwards show more fully, contends
that many an arid and desolate region in the East,
brown and burnt with barrenness, became a desolation
because men understood not the restoration
which all nature demands for the land. He declares
that the now desolate regions of the East
had been made desolate, because “the inhabitants
did not understand the art of restoring exhausted
soil.” It would be hopeless now to form, or
attempt to form, the “hanging gardens,” or to
display the rich florescence “round about Babylon,”
to be seen when Alexander the Great died
in that city. The Tigris and Euphrates, before
and after their junction, Liebig maintains, have
carried, and, to a circumscribed degree, still carry,
into the sea “a sufficient amount of manure for
the reproduction of food for millions of human
beings.” It is said that, “could that matter
only be arrested in its progress, and converted
into bread and wine, fruit and beef, mutton and
wool, linen and cotton, then cities might flourish
once more in the desert, where men are now digging
for the relics of primitive civilization, and
discovering the symbols of luxury and ease beneath
the barren sand and the sunburnt clay.”</p>

<p>This is one great evil; but in our metropolis there
is a greater, a far greater, beyond all in degree,
even if the same abuse exist elsewhere. What
society with one consent pronounces filth&mdash;the evacuations
of the human body&mdash;is not only washed
into the Thames, and the land so deprived of a vast
amount of nutriment, but the tide washes these evacuations
back again, with other abominations. The
water we use is derived almost entirely from the
Thames, and therefore the water in which we boil
our vegetables and our meat, the water for our coffee
and tea, the water brewed for our consumption, comes
to us, and is imbibed by us, impregnated over and
over again with our own animal offal. We import
guano, and drink a solution of our own fæces: a
manure which might be made far more valuable
than the foreign guano.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the evils of making a common
sewer of the neighbouring river.</p>

<p>The other mode of removal is, to convey the
wet house-refuse, by drains, to a hole near the
house where it is produced, and empty it periodically
when full.</p>

<p>The house-drainage throughout London has two
characteristics. By one system all excrementitious
and slop refuse generally is carried usually along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
brick drains from the water-closets, privies, sinks,
lavatories, &amp;c., of the houses into the cesspools,
where it accumulates until its removal (by manual
labour) becomes necessary, which is not, as an
average, more than once in two years. By the
other, and the newer system, all the house-refuse
is drained into the public sewer, the cesspool
system being thereby abolished. All the houses
built or rebuilt since 1848 are constructed on the
last-mentioned principle of drainage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first of these modes is cesspoolage.</p>

<p>The second is sewerage.</p></div>

<p>I shall first deal with the sewerage of the metropolis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Quantity of Metropolitan
Sewage.</span></h3>

<p>Having estimated the gross quantity of wet house-refuse
produced throughout London in the course
of the year, and explained the two modes of removing
it from the immediate vicinity of the
house, I will now proceed to set forth the <i>quantity</i>
of wet house-refuse matter which it has been
<i>ascertained</i> is removed with the contents of London
sewers.</p>

<p>An experiment was made on the average discharge
of sewage from the outlets of Church-lane
and Smith-street, Chelsea, Ranelagh, King’s
Scholar’s-pond, Grosvenor-wharf, Horseferry-road,
Wood-street, King-street, Northumberland-street,
Durham-yard, Norfolk-street, and Essex-street
(the four last-mentioned places running from the
Strand). The experiments were made “under
ordinary and extraordinary circumstances,” in the
months of May, June, and July, 1844, but the
system is still the same, so that the result in the
investigation as to the sewage of the year 1844
may be taken as a near criterion of the present,
as regards the localities specified and the general
quantity.</p>

<p>The surface drained into the outlets before
enumerated covers, in its total area, about 7000
acres, of which nearly 3500 may be classed as
urban. The observations, moreover, were made
generally during fine weather.</p>

<p>I cannot do better by way of showing the
reader the minuteness with which these observations
were made, than by quoting the two following
results, being those of the fullest and smallest
discharges of twelve issues into the river. I must
premise that these experiments were made on
seven occasions, from May 4 to July 12 inclusive,
and made at different times, but generally about
eight hours after high water. In the Northumberland-street
sewer, from which was the largest issue,
the width of the sewer at the outlet was five feet.
In the King-street sewer (the smallest discharge,
as given in the second table) the width of the
sewer was four feet. The width, however, does
not affect the question, as there was a greater
issue from the Norfolk-street sewer of two feet,
than from the King-street sewer of four feet in
width.</p>

</table></div>
<p>Here we find that the mean discharge per
second was, from the Northumberland-street
sewer, 692,382· cubic feet per 24 hours, and from
the King-street sewer, 3049 cubic feet per 24
hours.</p>

<p>The discharge from the principal outlets in the
Westminster district “being the mean of seven
observations taken during the summer,” was
1,798,094 cubic feet in 24 hours; the number of
acres drained was 7006. <i>The mean discharge
per acre, in the course of 24 hours, was found to
be about 256 cubic feet, comprising the urban
and suburban parts.</i></p>

<p>The sewage, from the discharge of which
this calculation was derived&mdash;and the dryness of
the weather must not be lost sight of&mdash;may be
fairly assumed as derived (in a dry season) almost
entirely from artificial sources or house drainage,
as there was no rain-fall, or but little. “<i>Supposing,
therefore</i>,” the Report states, “<i>the entire
surface to be urban, we have 540 cubic feet as
the mean daily discharge per acre</i>. If, however,
the average be taken of the first eight outlets,
viz., from Essex-street to Grosvenor-wharf inclusive,
which drain a surface wholly urban, the
result is 1260 cubic feet per acre in the 24 hours.
This excess may be attributed to the number of
manufactories, and the densely-populated nature
of the locality drained; but, as indicative of the
general amount of sewage due to ordinary urban
districts, the former ought perhaps to be considered
the fairer average.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>It is then assumed&mdash;I may say officially&mdash;that
the average discharge of the urban and suburban
sewage from the several districts included
within an area of 58 square miles, is equal to
256 cubic feet per acre.</p>

<p>Or a quantity equivalent to a surface of more
than 36 acres in extent, and 6 feet in depth.</p>

<p>This mass of sewage, it must be borne in mind,
is but the <i>daily</i> product of the sewage of the more
populous part of the districts included within the
jurisdiction of the two commissions of sewers.</p>

<p>The foregoing observations, calculations, and
deductions have supplied the basis of many
scientific and commercial speculations, but it must
be remembered that they were taken between
seven and eight years ago. The observations
were made, moreover, during fine summer weather,
generally, while the greatest discharge is during
rainy weather. There has been, also, an increase
of sewers in the metropolis, because an increase of
streets and inhabited houses. The approximate
proportion of the increase of sewers (and there is
no precise account of it) is pretty nearly that of
the streets, lineally. Another matter has too,
of late years, added to the amount of sewage&mdash;the
abolition of cesspoolage in a considerable degree,
owing to the late Building and Sanitary
Acts, so that fæcal and culinary matters, which
were drained into the cesspool (to be removed by
the nightmen), are now drained into the sewer.
Altogether, I am assured, on good authority, the
daily discharge of the sewers extending over 58
square miles of the metropolis may be now put at
10,000,000 cubic feet, instead of rather more
than nine and a half millions. And this gives, as</p>

</table></div>

<p>So that the 3,650,000,000 cubic feet of sewage
annually removed from 58 square miles of the
metropolis refer to only one-half of the entire
area of the <i>true</i> metropolis; but it refers, at the
same time, to that part of London which is the
most crowded with houses, and since, in the
suburbs, the buildings average about 2 to the
acre, and, in the densest parts of London, about
30, it is but fair to assume that the refuse
would be, at least, in the same proportion, and
this is very nearly the fact; for if we suppose the
58 miles of the suburban districts to yield twenty
times less sewage than the 58 miles of the urban
districts, we shall have 182,500,000 cubic feet
to add to the 3,650,000,000 cubic feet before
given, or 3,832,500,000 for the sewage of the
entire metropolis.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the sewage has ever
been weighed so as to give any definite result,
but calculating from the weight of water (a gallon,
or 10 lbs. of water, comprising 277·274 cubic
inches, and 1 ton of liquid comprising 36 cubic
feet) the total, from the returns of the investigation
in 1844, would be</p>

<p>In September, 1849, Mr. Banfield, at one time
a Commissioner of Sewers, put the yearly quantity
of sewage discharged into the Thames at
45,000,000 tons; but this is widely at variance
with the returns as to quantity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of Ancient Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>The traverser of the London streets rarely
thinks, perhaps, of the far extended subterranean
architecture below his feet; yet such is indeed
the case, for the sewers of London, with all their
imperfections, irregularities, and even absurdities,
are still a great work; certainly not equal, in all
respects, to what once must have existed in Rome,
but second, perhaps, only to the giant works of
sewerage in the eternal city.</p>

<p>The origin of these Roman sewers seems to be
wrapped in as great a mystery as the foundation
of the city itself. The statement of the Roman historians
is that these sewers were the works of the
elder Tarquin, the fifth (apocryphal) king of Rome.
Tarquin’s dominions, from the same accounts, did
not in any direction extend above sixteen miles,
and his subjects could be but banditti, foragers,
and shepherds. One conjecture is, that Rome
stands on the site of a more ancient city, and that
to its earlier possessors may be attributed the
work of the sewers. To attribute them to the
rudeness and small population of Tarquin’s day,
it is contended, is as feasible as it would be to
attribute the ruins of ancient Jerusalem, or any
others in Asia Minor, to the Turks, or the ruins
of Palmyra to the Arabs, because these people
enjoy the privilege of possession.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE SEWER-HUNTER.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The main sewer of Rome, the Cloaca Maxima,
is said to have been lofty and wide enough for a
waggon load of hay to pass clear along it. Another,
and more probable account, however, states
that it was proposed to <i>enlarge</i> the great sewer to
these dimensions, but it does not appear to have
been so enlarged. Indeed, when Augustus “made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Rome marble,” it was one of his great works also,
under the direction of Agrippa, to reconstruct, improve,
and enlarge the sewers. It was a project
in the days of Rome’s greatness to turn seven
navigable rivers into vast subterraneous passages,
larger sewers, along which barges might pass,
carrying on the traffic of Imperial Rome. In one
year the cost of cleansing, renewing, and repairing
the sewers is stated to have been 1000 talents of
gold, or upwards of 192,000<i>l.</i> Of the <i>average</i>
yearly cost we have no information. Some accounts
represent these sewers as having been rebuilt
after the irruption of the Gauls. In Livy’s
time they were pronounced not to be accommodated
to the plan of Rome. Some portions of
these ancient structures are still extant, but they
seem to have attracted small notice even from professed
antiquarians; their subterranean character,
however, renders such notice little possible. In
two places they are still kept in repair, and for
their original purpose, to carry off the filth of the
city, but only to a small extent.</p>

<p>Our legislative enactments on the subject of
sewers are ancient and numerous. The oldest is
that of 9 Henry III., and the principal is that of
23 Henry VIII., commonly called the “Statute of
Sewers.” These and many subsequent statutes,
however, relate only to watercourses, and are
silent as regards my present topic&mdash;the Refuse of
London.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how little is said in the London
historians of the <i>sewers</i>. In the two folio
volumes of the most searching and indefatigable
of all the antiquarians who have described the
old metropolis, John Stow, the tailor, there is no
account of what we now consider sewers, inclosed
and subterranean channels for the conveyance of
the refuse filth of the metropolis to its destination&mdash;the
Thames. Had covered sewers been known,
or at any rate been at all common, in Stow’s day,
and he died full of years in 1604, and had one of
them presented but a crumbling stone with some
heraldic, or apparently heraldic, device at its outlet,
Stow’s industry would certainly have ferreted
out some details. Such, however, is not the case.</p>

<p>This absence of information I hold to be owing
to the fact that no such sewers then existed. Our
present system of sewerage, like our present system
of street-lighting, is a modern work; but it is
not, like our gas-lamps, an <i>original</i> English work.
We have but followed, as regards our arched and
subterraneous sewerage, in the wake of Rome.</p>

<p>As I have said, the early <i>laws</i> of sewers relate
to watercourses, navigable communications, dams,
ditches, and such like; there is no doubt, however,
that in the heart of the great towns the filth
of the houses was, by rude contrivances in the
way of drainage, or natural fall, emptied into such
places. Even in the accounts of the sewers of
ancient Rome, historians have stated that it is
not easy, and sometimes not possible, to distinguish
between the <i>sewers</i> and the <i>aqueducts</i>, and
Dr. Lemon, in his English Etymology, speaks of
sewers as a species of aqueducts. So, in some of
our earlier Acts of Parliament, it is hardly possible
to distinguish whether the provisions to be applied
to the management of a sewer relate to a
ditch to which house-filth was carried&mdash;to a
channel of water for general purposes&mdash;or to an
open channel being a receptacle of filth and a
navigable stream at the same time.</p>

<p>That the ditches were not sewers for the conveyance
of the filth from the houses to any very
great, or rather any very general extent, may very
well be concluded, because (as I have shown in
my account of the early scavagers) the excrementitious
matter was deposited during the night in
the street, and removed by the proper functionaries
in the morning, or as soon as suited their
convenience. Though this was the case generally,
it is evident that the filth, or a portion of it, from
the houses which were built on the banks of the
Fleet River (as it was then called, as well as the
Fleet Ditch), and on the banks of the other
“brooks,” drained into the current stream. The
Corporation accounts contain very frequent mention
of the cleansing, purifying, and “thorough” cleansing
of the Fleet Ditch, the Old Bourne (Holborn
Brook), the Wall Brook, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of all these streams the most remarkable was
Fleet Ditch, which was perhaps the first main
sewer of London. I give from Stow the following
curious account of its origin. It is now open,
but only for a short distance, offending the air of
Clerkenwell. At one period it was to afford a
defence to the City! as the Tower-moat was a
defence to the Tower, and fortress.</p>

<p>“The Ditch, which partly now remaineth and
compassed the Wall of the City, was begun to be
made by the <i>Londoners</i>, in the year 1211, and
finished 1213, the 15th of K. <i>John</i>. This Ditch
being then made of 200 foot broad, caused no
small hindrance to the Canons of the Holy <i>Trinity</i>,
whose Church stood near <i>Ealdgate</i>, for that the
said Ditch passed through their Ground from the
<i>Tower</i> unto <i>Bishopsgate</i>.</p>

<p>“The first Occasion of making a Ditch about the
City seems to have been this: <i>William</i>, Bishop
of <i>Ely</i>, Chancellor of <i>England</i>, in the Reign of
King <i>Richard</i> I., made a great Ditch round about
the <i>Tower</i>, for the better Defence of it against
<i>John</i> the King’s Brother, the King being then out
of the Realm. Then did the City also begin a
Ditch to encompass and strengthen their Walls
[which happened between the Years 1190 and
1193.] So the Book <i>Dunthorn</i>. Yet the Register
of <i>Bermondsey</i> writes that the Ditch was begun,
Oct. 15, 1213, which was in the Reign of King
<i>John</i> that succeeded to <i>Richard</i>.</p>

<p>“This Ditch being originally made for the
Defence of the City, was also a long time together
carefully cleansed and maintained, as Need required;
but now of late neglected, and forced
either to a very narrow, and the same a filthy
Channel.</p>

<p>“In the Year of <i>Christ</i>, 1354, 28 <i>Ed.</i> 3, the
Ditch of this City flowing over the Bank into the
<i>Tower-ditch</i>, the King commanded the said Ditch
of the City to be cleansed, and so ordered, that
the overflowing thereof should not force any Filth
into the <i>Tower-ditch</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Anno</i>, 1379, John Philpot, Maior of <i>London</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
caused this Ditch to be cleansed, and every
Houshold to pay 5<i>d.</i>, which was a Day’s Work
toward the Charges thereof.</p>

<p>“<i>Ralph Joseline</i>, Maior, 1477, caused the
whole Ditch to be cast and cleansed....
In 1519, the 10th of Henry 8, for cleansing and
scouring the common Ditch, between <i>Aldgate</i>,
and the Postern next the <i>Tower-ditch</i>; the chief
Ditcher had by the day 7<i>d.</i>, the Second Ditcher,
6<i>d.</i>, the other Ditchers, 5<i>d.</i> And every Vagabond
(for as they were then termed) 1<i>d.</i> the Day, Meat
and Drink, at the Charges of the City. Sum
95<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“Fleet Ditch was again cleansed in the Year
1549,” Stow continues, “<i>Henry Ancoates</i> being
Maior, at the Charges of the Companies. And
again 1569, the 11th of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>; for
cleansing the same Ditch between <i>Ealdgate</i> and
the <i>Postern</i>, and making a new Sewer and Wharf
of Timber, from the Head of the <i>Postern</i> into the
<i>Tower-ditch</i>, 814<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> (was disbursed). Before
the which Time the said Ditch lay open, without
either Wall or Pall, having therein great Store of
very good Fish, of divers Sorts, as many men yet
living, who have taken and tasted them, can well
witness. But now no such matter, the Charge of
Cleansing is spared, and great Profit made by
letting out the Banks, with the Spoil of the whole
Ditch.”</p>

<p>The above information appeared, but I am unable
to specify the year (for Stow’s works went
through several editions, though it is to be feared
he died very poor) between 1582 and 1590. So
did the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“At this Day there be no Ditches or Boggs in
the City except the said <i>Fleet-ditch</i>, but instead
thereof large common <i>Dreins</i> and <i>Sewers</i>, made to
carry away the water from the <i>Postern-Gate</i>,
between the two <i>Tower-hills</i> to <i>Fleet-bridge</i> without
<i>Ludgate</i>.”</p>

<p>Great, indeed, is the change in the character of
the capital of England, from the times when the
Fleet Ditch was a defence to the city (which was
then the entire capital); and from the later era,
when “great store of very good fish of divers sorts,”
rewarded the skill or the patience of the anglers
or netters; but this, it is evident, was in the parts
near the river (the Tower postern, &amp;c.), and at
that time, or about that time, there was salmon-fishing
in the Thames, at least as far up as Hungerford
Wharf.</p>

<p>The Fleet Ditch seems always to have had a
<i>sewery</i> character. It was described, in 1728, as</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“The king of dykes! than whom no sluice of mud</div>
      <div class="verse">With deeper sable blots the silver flood&mdash;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the <i>silver</i> flood being, in Queen Anne’s and the
First George’s days, the London Thames. This
silver has been much alloyed since that time.</p>

<p>Until within these 40 or 50 years, open sewer-ditches,
into which drains were emptied, and
ordure and refuse thrown, were frequent, especially
in the remoter parts of Lambeth and Newington,
and some exist to this day; one especially,
open for a considerable distance, flowing along the
back of the houses in the Westminster-road, on
the right-hand side towards the bridge, into
which the neighbouring houses are drained. The
“Black Ditch,” a filthy sewer, until lately was
open near the Broadwall, and other vicinities of
the Blackfriars-road. The open ditch-sewers of
Norwood and Wandsworth have often been
spoken of in Sanitary Reports. Indeed, some of
our present sewers, in addition to Fleet River
and Wall Brook, are merely ditches rudely arched
over.</p>

<p>The first covered and continuous street sewer
was erected in London&mdash;I think, without doubt&mdash;when
Wren rebuilt the capital, after the great
fire of 1666. Perhaps there is no direct evidence
of the fact, for, although the statutes and Privy
Council and municipal enactments, consequent on
the rebuilding of the capital, required, more or less
peremptorily, “fair sewers, and drains, and watercourses,”
it is not defined in these enactments what
was meant by a “sewer;” nor were they carried
out.</p>

<p>I may mention, as a further proof that open
ditches, often enough stagnant ditches also, were
the first London sewers, that, after 1666, a plan,
originally projected, it appears, by Sir Leonard
Halliday, Maior, 60 years previously, and strenuously
supported at that time by Nic Leate, “a
worthy and grave citizen,” was revived and reconsidered.
This project, for which Sir Leonard
and Nic Leate “laboured much,” was “for a
river to be brought on the north of the city into
it, for the cleansing the sewers and ditches, and
for the better keeping London wholesome, sweet,
and clean.” An admirable <i>intention</i>; and it is
not impossible nor improbable that in less than
two centuries hence, we, of the present sanitary
era, may be accounted, for our sanitary measures,
as senseless as we now account good Sir Leonard
Halliday and the worthy and grave Nic Leate.
These gentlemen cared not to brook filth in their
houses, nor to be annoyed by it in the nightly
pollution of the streets, but they advocated its injection
into running water, and into water often
running slowly and difficultly, and continually
under the eyes and noses of the citizens. <i>We</i>, I
apprehend, go a little further. We drink, and
use for the preparation of our meals, the befouled
water, which they did not; for, more than seven-eighths
of our water-supply from the companies is
drawn from the Thames, the main sewer of the
greatest city in the world, ancient or modern,
into which millions of tons of every description of
refuse are swept yearly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Kinds and Characteristics of
Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>The sewers of London may be arranged into two
distinct groups&mdash;according to the side of the
Thames on which they are situate.</p>

<p>Now the essential difference between these
two classes of sewers lies in the elevation of the
several localities whence the sewers carry the
refuse to the Thames.</p>

<p>The chief differences in the circumstances of
the people north and south of the river are shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
in the annexed table from the Registrar-General’s
<span class="lock">returns:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td></td><th>London.</th><th>North side of the River.</th><th>South side of the River.</th></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Here, it will be seen, that while the houses on
the north side of the river stand, on an average,
51 feet above the high-water mark of the Thames,
those on the south side are only 5 feet above it.
The effect of this is shown most particularly in
the deaths from cholera in 1849, which were
nearly three times as many on the south as on the
north side of the Thames. It is said, officially,
that “of the 15 square miles of the Urban
district on the south side of the river Thames,
<i>three</i> miles are from six to seven feet below high-water
mark, so that the locality may be said to be
drained only for four hours out of the twelve, and
during these four hours very imperfectly....
When the tide rises above the orifices of the
sewers, the whole drainage of the district is
stopped until the tide recedes again, rendering
the whole system of sewers in Kent and Surrey
only an <i>articulation of cesspools</i>.”</p>

<p>That this is but the fact, the following table of
the elevation in feet above the Trinity high-water
mark, as regards the several districts on the Surrey
side of the Thames, may be cited as evidence.</p>

<p>From these returns, made by Capt. Dawson,
R.E., the difficulty, to use no stronger word,
attending the sewerage of the Surrey district is
shown at once. There is no flow to be had, or&mdash;the
word more generally used, no <i>run</i> for the
sewage. In parts of the north of England it used
to be a general, and still is a partial, saying
among country-people who are figuratively describing
what they account impossible. “Ay,
when? <i>When</i> water runs up bank.” This is a
homely expression of the difficulties attending the
Surrey sewerage.</p>

<p>There is, as regards these Surrey, more than
the Kent, sewers, another evil which promotes
the “articulation of cesspools.” Some of these
sewers have “dead-ends,” like places which in the
streets (a parallel case enough) are known as “no
thoroughfare,” and in these sewers it is seldom, in
any state of the tide, that flushing can be resorted
to; consequently these cesspool-like sewers
remain uncleansed, or have to be cleansed by
manual labour, the matter being drawn up into
the street or road.</p>

<p>The refuse conduits of the metropolis are of two
<span class="lock">kinds:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Sewers.</li>
<li>2. Drains.</li>

</ul>

<p>These two classes of refuse-charts are often
confounded, even in some official papers, the
sewer being there designated the “main drain.”
All sewerage is undoubtedly drainage, but there
is a manifest distinction between a sewer and a
drain.</p>

<p>The First-Class Sewers, which are generally
termed “main sewers,” and run along the centres
of the first-class streets (first-class alike from the
extent or populousness of such streets), may be
looked upon as underground rivers of refuse, to
which the drains are tributary rivulets. No
sewer exists unconnected with the drains from the
streets and houses; but many house-drains are
constructed apart from the sewers, communicating
only with the cesspools. Even where houses are
built in close contiguity to a public sewer, and
built after the new mode without cesspools, there
is always a drain to the sewer; no house so
situated can get rid of its refuse except by means
of a drain; unless, indeed, the house be not
drained at all, and its filth be flung down a gullyhole,
or got rid of in some other way.</p>

<p>These drains, all with a like determination,
differ only in their forms. They are barrel-shaped,
made of rounded bricks, or earthenware pipeage,
and of an interior between a round and an oval,
with a diameter of from 2 to 6 inches, although
only a few private houses, comparatively, are
so drained. The barrel drain of larger dimensions,
is used in the newer public buildings and
larger public mansions, when it represents a sort
of house or interior sewer as well as a house main
drain, for smaller drains find their issue into the
barrel-drain. There is the barrel-drain in the new
Houses of Parliament, and in large places which
cover the site of, and are required for the purposes
of several houses or offices. The tubular drain is
simply piping, of which I have spoken fully in
my account of the present compulsory mode of
house drainage. The third drain, one more used
to carry refuse to the cesspool than the sewer, but
still carrying such refuse to the sewers, is the old-fashioned
brick drain, generally 9 inches square.</p>

<p>I shall first deal with the sewerage, and then
with the house and street drainage.</p>

<p>The sewer is a twofold receptacle of refuse;
into it are conveyed the wet refuse not only of
many of the houses, but of all the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>The slop or surface water of the streets is conveyed
to the sewer by means of smaller sewers or
street-drains running from the “kennel” or
channel to the larger sewers.</p>

<p>In the streets, at such uncertain distances as
the traffic and circumstances of the locality may
require, are gully-holes. These are openings into
the sewer, and were formerly called, as they were,
simply gratings, a sort of iron trap-doors of grated
bars, clumsily made, and placed almost at random.
On each side of the street was, even into the present
century, a very formidable channel, or kennel, as
it was formerly written, into which, in heavy rains,
the badly-scavaged street dirt was swept, often
demanding a good leap from one who wished to
cross in a hurry. These “kennels” emptied
themselves into the gratings, which were not unfrequently
choked up, and the kennel was then an
utter nuisance. At the present time the channel
is simply a series of stone work at the edge of
the footpaths, blocks of granite being sloped to
meet more or less at right angles, and the flow
from the inclination from the centre of the street
to the channel is carried along without impedimen
or nuisance into the gully-hole.</p>

<p>The gully-hole opens into a drain, running, with
a rapid slope, into the sewer, and so the wet
refuse of the streets find its vent.</p>

<p>In many courts, alleys, lanes, &amp;c., inhabited by
the poor, where there is imperfect or no drainage
to the houses, all the slops from the houses are
thrown down the gully-holes, and frequently
enough blood and offal are poured from butchers’
premises, which might choke the house drain.
There have, indeed, been instances of worthless
street dirt (slop) collected into a scavager’s vehicle
being shot down a gully-hole.</p>

<p>The sewers, as distinct from the drains, are to be
divided principally into three classes, all devoted
to the same purpose&mdash;the conveyance of the underground
filth of the capital to the Thames&mdash;and
all connected by a series of drains, afterwards to
be described, with the dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>The <i>first-class sewers</i> are found in the main
streets, and flow at their outlets into the river.</p>

<p>The <i>second-class sewers</i> run along the second-class
streets, discharging their contents into a
first-class sewer; and</p>

<p>The <i>third-class sewers</i> are for the reception of
the sewage from the smaller streets, and always
communicate, for the voidance of their contents,
with a sewer of the second or first description.</p>

<p>As regards the destination of the sewers, there
is no difference between the Middlesex and
Surrey portions of the metropolis. The sewage
is <i>all</i> floated into the river.</p>

<p>The first-class sewers of the modern build
rarely exceed 50 inches by 30 in internal dimensions;
the second class, 40 inches by 24; the
third, 30 inches by 18.</p>

<p>Smaller class or branch sewers, from No. 4 to
No. 8 inclusive, also form part of the great subterranean
filth-channels of the metropolis. It is
only, however, the three first-mentioned classes
which can be described as in any way principal
<i>sewers</i>; the others are in the capacity of branch
sewers, the ramifications being in many places
very extensive, while pipes are often used. The
dimensions of these smaller sewers, when pipes
are not used, are&mdash;No. 4, 20 inches by 12;
No. 5, 17&frac12; inches by 10&frac12;; No. 6, 15 inches by
9; No. 7, 12 inches by 7&frac12;; and No. 8, 9 inches
by 6.</p>

<p>These branch sewers may, from their circumscribed
dimensions, be looked upon as mere
channels of connection with the larger descriptions;
but they present, as I have intimated, an
important part of the general system. This may
be shown by the fact, that in the estimates for
building sewers for the improvement of the
drainage of the city of Westminster (a plan, however,
not carried out), the estimated, or indeed
surveyed, run of the first class was to be 8118
feet; of the second class, 4524 feet; of the third,
but 2086 feet; while of the No. 5 and No. 6
description, it was, respectively, 18,709 and
53,284 feet. The branch sewers may, perhaps,
be represented in many instances as public drains
connecting the sewer of the street with the issue
from the houses, but I give the appellation I find
in the reports.</p>

<p>The dimensions I have cited are not to be
taken as an average size of the existing sewers of
the metropolis on either side of the Thames, for
no average size and no uniformity of shape can be
adduced, as there has been no uniformity observed.
The sewers are of all sizes and shapes,
and of all depths from the surface of the streets.
I was informed by an engineering authority that
he had often seen it asserted that the naval
authorities of the kingdom could not build a war-steamer,
and it might very well be said that the
sanitary authorities of the metropolis could not
build a sewer, as none of the present sewers could
be cited as in all respects properly fulfilling all
the functions required. But it must be remembered
that the present engineers have to contend
with great difficulties, the whole matter being so
complicated by the blunderings and mismanagement
of the past.</p>

<p>The dimensions I have cited (because they
appear officially) exceed the medium size of the
<i>newer</i> sewerage, the average height of the first
class being in such sewers about 3 feet 9 inches.</p>

<p><i>Of the width of the sewers</i>, as of the height, no
precise average can be drawn. Perhaps that of
the New Palace main, or first-class sewer, 3 feet
6 inches, may be nearest the average, while the
smaller classes diminish in their width in the
proportions I have shown. The sewers of the
older constructions nearly all widen and deepen
as they near the outlet, and this at no definite
distance from the river, but from a quarter of a
mile or somewhat less to a mile and more. Some
such sewers are then 14 feet in width; some 20
feet, and no doubt of proportionate height, but I
do not find that the height has been ascertained.
For flushing purposes there are recesses of greater
or less width, according to the capacity of the
sewer, where sluice-gates, &amp;c., can be fixed, and
water accumulated.</p>

<p>Under the head of “Subterranean Survey of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the Sewers,” will be found some account of the
different dimensions of the sewers.</p>

<p><i>The form of the interior of the sewers</i> (as shown
in the illustrations I have given) is irregularly
elliptical. They are arched at the summits, and
more or less hollowed or curved, internally, at the
bottom. The bottom of the sewer is called the
“invert,” from a general resemblance in the construction
to an “inverted” arch. The <i>best</i> form
of invert is a matter which has attracted great
engineering attention. It is, indeed, the important
part of the sewer, as the part along which
there is the flow of sewage; and the superior
or inferior formation of the invert, of course,
facilitates or retards the transmission of the contents.</p>

<p>A few years back, the building of egg-shaped,
or “oviform” sewers, was strongly advocated. It
was urged that the flow of the sewage and the
sewer-water was accelerated by the invert (especially)
being oviform, as the matter was more
condensed when such was the shape adopted,
while the more the matter was diffused, as in
some of the inverts of the more usual form of
sewers, the less rapid was its flow, and consequently
the greater its deposit.</p>

<p>What extent of egg-shaped sewers are now, so
to speak, at work, I could not ascertain. One
informant thought it might be somewhere about
50 miles.</p>

<p>The following interesting account of the velocities
of streams, with a relativeness to sewers, is
extracted from the evidence of Mr. <span class="lock">Phillips:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The area of surface that a sewer will drain,
and the quantity of water that it will discharge in
a given time, will be greater or less in proportion
as the channel is inclined from a horizontal to a
vertical position. The ordinary or common run
of water in each sewer, due from house drainage
alone, and irrespective of rain, should have sufficient
velocity to prevent the usual matter discharged
into the sewer from depositing. For this
purpose, it is necessary that there should be in
each sewer a constant velocity of current equal to
2&frac12; feet per second, or 1&frac34; mile per hour.” Mr.
Phillips then states that the inclinations of all
rivulets, &amp;c., diminish as they progress to their
outfalls. “If the force of the waters of the river
Rhone,” he has said, “were not absorbed by the
operation of some constant retardation in its
course, the stream would have shot into the Bay
of Marseilles with the tremendous velocity of
164 miles every hour. Even if the Thames met
with no system of impediments in its course, the
stream would have rushed into the sea with a
velocity of 80 feet per second, or 54&frac12; miles in an
hour.... The inclinations of the sewers
of a natural district should be made to diminish
from their heads to their outfalls in a corresponding
ratio of progression, so that as the body of
water is increased at each confluence, one and the
same velocity and force of current may be kept up
throughout the whole of them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips advocates a tubular system of
sewerage and drainage.</p>

<p>The main sewer, which has lately called forth
the most public attention and professional controversy,
is that connected with the new Houses of
Parliament, or as they are called in divers reports
and correspondence, the “New Palace at Westminster.”</p>

<p><i>The workmanship in the building of the sewers</i>
is of every quality. The material of which some
of the older sewers are constructed is a porous
sort of brick, which is often found crumbling and
broken, and saturated with damp and rottenness,
from the exhalations and contact of their contents.
The sewers erected, however, within the last
twenty, and more especially within the last ten
years, are sometimes of granite, but generally of
the best brick, with an interior coating of enduring
cement, and generally with concrete on their
exterior, to protect them from the dampness and
decaying qualities of the superincumbent or lateral
soil.</p>

<p><i>The depth of the sewers</i>&mdash;I mean from the top
of the sewer to the surface of the street&mdash;seems
to vary as everything else varies about them.
Some are found forty feet below the street, some
<i>two</i> feet, some almost level! These, however,
are exceptions; and the average depth of
the sewers on the Middlesex side is from twelve
to fourteen feet; on the Surrey side, from six to
eight feet. The reason is that the north shores of
the metropolis are above the tide level, the south
shores are below it.</p>

<p>An authority on the subject has said, “The
Surrey sewers are bad, owing principally to the
land being below tide level. They were the most
expensively constructed, because, <i>perhaps</i>, in that
Commission the surveyors were paid by percentage
on the cost of works. When it was proposed,
in the Westminster Commission, to effect a reduction
of four-fifths in the cost, it was like a proposition
to return the officers’ salaries to that extent,
if they had been paid in that way.”</p>

<p>The reader may have observed that the official
intelligence I have given all, or nearly all, refers
to the “Westminster and part of Middlesex”
Commission, and to that of the “Surrey and
Kent.” This is easily accounted for. In the
metropolitan districts, up to 1847, the only Commission
which published its papers was the Westminster,
of which Mr. L. C. Hertslet had the
charge as clerk; when the Commissions were consolidated
in 1847, he printed the Westminster and
Surrey only, the others being of minor importance.</p>

<p>I may observe that one of the engineers, in
showing the difficulty or impossibility of giving
any description of a <i>system</i> of sewerage, as to
points of agreement or difference, represents the
whole mass as but a “detached parcel of sewers.”</p>

<p><i>The course of the sewers</i> is in no direct or
uniform line, with the exception of one characteristic&mdash;all
their bearings are towards the river as
regards the main sewers (first-class), and all the
bearings of the second-class sewers are towards
the main sewers in the main streets. The smaller
classes of sewers fill up the great area of London
sewerage with a perfect network of intersection
and connection, and even this network is increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
manyfold by its connection with the house-drains.</p>

<p>There is no map of the general sewerage of the
metropolis, merely “sections” and “plans” of
improvements making or suggested, in the reports
of the surveyors, &amp;c., to the Commissioners; but
did a map of subterranean London exist, with its
lines of every class of sewerage and of the drainage
which feeds the sewers; with its course,
moreover, of gas-pipes and water-pipes, with their
connection with the houses, the streets, the courts,
&amp;c., it would be the most curious and skeleton-like
map in the world.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Subterranean Character of the
Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>In my inquiries among that curious body of men,
the “Sewer Hunters,” I found them make light
of any danger, their principal fear being from the
attacks of rats in case they became isolated from
the gang with whom they searched in common,
while they represented the odour as a mere nothing
in the way of unpleasantness. But these
men pursued only known and (by them) beaten
tracks at low water, avoiding any deviation, and
so becoming but partially acquainted with the
character and direction of the sewers. And had
it been otherwise, they are not a class competent
to describe what they saw, however keen-eyed
after silver spoons.</p>

<p>The following account is derived chiefly from
official sources. I may premise that where the
deposit is found the greatest, the sewer is in the
worst state. This deposit, I find it repeatedly
stated, is of a most miscellaneous character. Some
of the sewers, indeed, are represented as the
dust-bins and dung-hills of the immediate neighbourhood.
The deposit has been found to comprise
all the ingredients from the breweries, the
gas-works, and the several chemical and mineral
manufactories; dead dogs, cats, kittens, and rats;
offal from slaughter-houses, sometimes even including
the entrails of the animals; street-pavement
dirt of every variety; vegetable refuse;
stable-dung; the refuse of pig-styes; night-soil;
ashes; tin kettles and pans (pansherds); broken
stoneware, as jars, pitchers, flower-pots, &amp;c.;
bricks; pieces of wood; rotten mortar and rubbish
of different kinds; and even rags. Our
criminal annals of the previous century show
that often enough the bodies of murdered men
were thrown into the Fleet and other ditches,
then the open sewers of the metropolis, and if
found washed into the Thames, they were so
stained and disfigured by the foulness of the contents
of these ditches, that recognition was
often impossible, so that there could be but one
verdict returned&mdash;“Found drowned.” Clothes
stripped from a murdered person have been, it
was authenticated on several occasions in Old
Bailey evidence, thrown into the open sewer
ditches, when torn and defaced, so that they
might not supply evidence of identity. So close
is the connection between physical filthiness in
public matters and moral wickedness.</p>

<p>The following particulars show the characteristics
of the underground London of the sewers.
The subterranean surveys were made after the
commissions were consolidated.</p>

<p>“An old sewer, running between Great Smith-street
and St. Ann-street (Westminster), is a
curiosity among sewers, although it is probably
only one instance out of many similar constructions
that will be discovered in the course of the
subterranean survey. The bottom is formed of
planks laid upon transverse timbers, 6 inches by
6 inches, about 3 feet apart. The size of the
sewer varies in width from 2 to 6 feet, and
from 4 to 5 feet in height. The inclination
of the bottom is very irregular: there are jumps
up at two or three places, and it contains a deposit
of filth averaging 9 inches in depth, the
sickening smell from which escapes into the
houses and yards that drain into it. In many
places the side walls have given way for lengths
of 10 and 15 feet. Across this sewer timbers
have been laid, upon which the external wall of a
workshop has been built; the timbers are in a
decaying state, and should they give way, the
wall will fall into the sewer.”</p>

<p>From the further accounts of this survey, I find
that a sewer from the Westminster Workhouse,
which was of all shapes and sizes, was in so
wretched a condition that the leveller could
scarcely work for the thick scum that covered the
glasses of the spirit-level in a few minutes after
being wiped. “At the outfall into the Dean-street
sewer, it is 3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 8
inches for a short length. From the end of this,
a wide sewer branches in each direction at right
angles, 5 feet 8 inches by 5 feet 5 inches. Proceeding
to the eastward about 30 feet, a chamber
is reached about 30 feet in length, from the roof
of which hangings of putrid matter <i>like stalactites</i>
descend <i>three feet in length</i>. At the end of
this chamber, the sewer passes under the public
privies, the ceilings of which can be seen from it.
Beyond this it is not possible to go.”</p>

<p>“In the Lucas-street sewer, where a portion of
new work begins and the old terminates, a space
of about 10 feet has been covered with boards,
which, having broken, a dangerous chasm has
been caused immediately under the road.”</p>

<p>“The West-street sewer had one foot of deposit.
It was flushed while the levelling party
was at work there, and the stream was so rapid
that it nearly washed them away, instrument and
all.”</p>

<p>There are further accounts of “deposit,” or of
“stagnant filth,” in other sewers, varying from 6
to 14 inches, but that is insignificant compared to
what follows.</p>

<p>The foregoing, then, is the pith of the first
authentic account which has appeared in print of
the actually surveyed condition of the subterranean
ways, over which the super-terranean
tides of traffic are daily flowing.</p>

<p>The account I have just given relates to the
(former) Westminster and part of Middlesex district
on the north bank of the Thames, as ascertained
under the Metropolitan Commission. I
now give some extracts concerning a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
survey on the south bank, in different and distant
directions in the district, once the “Surrey and
Kent.” The Westminster, &amp;c., survey took place
in 1848; the Kent and Surrey in 1849. In the
one case, 72 miles of sewers were surveyed; in
the other, 69⅛ miles.</p>

<p>“The surveyors (in the Surrey and Kent
sewers) find great difficulty in levelling the
sewers of this district (I give the words of the
Report); for, in the first place, the deposit is
<i>usually</i> about two feet in depth, and in some
cases it amounts to nearly <i>five feet</i> of putrid matter.
The smell is usually of the most horrible
description, the air being so foul that explosion
and choke damp are very frequent. On the 12th
January we were very nearly losing a whole party
by choke damp, the last man being dragged out
on his back (through two feet of black fœtid
deposits) in a state of insensibility.... Two
men of one party had also a narrow escape from
drowning in the Alscot-road sewer, Rotherhithe.</p>

<p>“The sewers on the Surrey side are very irregular;
even where they are inverted they frequently
have a number of steps and inclinations
the reverse way, causing the deposit to accumulate
in <i>elongated cesspools</i>.</p>

<p>“It must be considered very fortunate that the
subterranean parties did not first commence on
the Surrey side, for if such had been the case, we
should most undoubtedly have broken down.
When compared with Westminster, the sewers are
smaller and more full of deposit; and, bad as the
smell is in the sewers in Westminster, it is infinitely
worse on the Surrey side.”</p>

<p>Several details are then given, but they are
only particulars of the general facts I have stated.</p>

<p>The following, however, are distinct facts concerning
this branch of the subject.</p>

<p>In my inquiries among the working scavagers
I often heard of their emptying street slop into
sewers, and the following extract shows that I was
not <span class="lock">misinformed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The detritus from the macadamized roads
frequently forms a kind of grouting in the sewers
so hard that it cannot be removed without hand
labour.</p>

<p>“One of the sewers in Whitehall and another in
Spring-gardens have from three to four feet of
this sort of deposit; and another in Eaton-square
was found filled up within a few inches of the
‘soffit,’ but it is supposed that the scavengers
(scavagers) emptied the road-sweepings down the
gully-grate in this instance;” and in other instances,
too, there is no doubt&mdash;especially at
Charing Cross, and the Regent Circus, Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Concerning the sewerage of the most aristocratic
parts of the city of Westminster, and of
the fashionable squares, &amp;c., to the north of Oxford-street,
I glean the following particulars
(reported in 1849). They show, at any rate,
that the patrician quarters have not been unduly
favoured; that there has been no partiality in the
construction of the sewerage. In the Belgrave
and Eaton-square districts there are many faulty
places in the sewers which abound with noxious
matter, in many instances stopping up the house
drains and “smelling horribly.” It is much the
same in the Grosvenor, Hanover, and Berkeley-square
localities (the houses in the squares themselves
included). Also in the neighbourhood of
Covent-garden, Clare-market, Soho and Fitzroy-squares;
while north of Oxford-street, in and
about Cavendish, Bryanstone, Manchester, and
Portman-squares, there is so much rottenness and
decay that there is no security for the sewers
standing from day to day, and to flush them for
the removal of their “most loathsome deposit”
might be “to bring some of them down altogether.”</p>

<p>One of the accounts of a subterranean survey
concludes with the following rather curious statement:&mdash;“Throughout
the new Paddington district
the neighbourhood of Hyde Park Gardens,
and the costly squares and streets adjacent, the
sewers abound with the foulest deposit, from
which the most disgusting effluvium arises; indeed,
amidst the whole of the Westminster District
of Sewers the <i>only</i> little spot which can be
mentioned as being in at all a satisfactory state is
the Seven Dials.”</p>

<p>I may point out also that these very curious
and authenticated accounts by no means bear out
the zymotic doctrine of the Board of Health as
to the cause of cholera; for where the zymotic
influences from the sewers were the worst, in the
patrician squares of what has been called Belgravia
and Tyburnia, the cholera was the least
destructive. This, however, is no reason whatever
why the stench should not be stifled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the House-Drainage of the Metropolis
as connected with the Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>Every house built or rebuilt since the passing of
the Metropolitan Sewers Act in 1848, must be
drained, with an exception, which I shall specify,
into a sewer. The law, indeed, divested of its
technicalities is this: the owner of a newly-erected
house must drain it to a sewer, without
the intervention of a cesspool, if there be a sewer
within 100 feet of the site of the house; and, if
necessary, in places but partially built over, such
owner must continue the sewer along the premises,
and make the necessary drain into it; all
being done under the approval of the proper
officer under the Commissioners. If there be,
however, an established sewer, along the side,
front, or back of any house, a covered drain must
be made into that at the cost of the owner of the
premises to be drained. “Where a sewer,” says
the 46th section of the Act, “shall already be
made, and a drain only shall be required, the
party is to pay a contribution towards the original
expense of the sewer, if it shall have been made
within thirty-five years before the 4th of September,
1848, the contribution to be paid to the
builder of the sewer.”... “In cases where
there shall be no sewer into which a drain could
be made, the party must make a covered drain to
lead into a cesspool or other place (not under a
house) as the Commissioners may direct. If the
parties infringe this rule, the Commissioners may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
do the work and throw the cost on them in the
nature of an improvement rate, or as charges for
default, and levy the amount by distress.”</p>

<p>I mention these circumstances more particularly
to show the extent, and the far-continued ramification,
of the subterranean metropolis. I am
assured by one of the largest builders in the
western district of the capital that the new regulations
(as to the dispensing with cesspools) are
readily complied with, as it is a recommendation
which a house agent, or any one letting new premises,
is never slow to advance (“and when it’s
the truth,” he said, “they do it with a better
grace”), that there will be in the course of occupancy
no annoyance and no expense incurred in the clearing
away of cesspoolage.</p>

<p>I shall at present describe only the house-drainage,
which is connected with the public
sewerage. The old mode of draining a house
separately into the cesspool of the premises will,
of course, be described under the head of cesspoolage,
and that old system is still very prevalent.</p>

<p>At the times of passing both general and local
Acts concerning buildings, town improvements and
extensions, the erection of new streets and the
removal of old, much has been said and written
concerning better systems of ventilating, warming,
and draining dwelling-houses; but until after the
first outbreak of cholera in England, in 1832,
little public attention was given to the great
drainage of all the sewers. However, on the
passing of the Building and Sanitary Acts generally,
the authorities made many experiments,
not so much to improve the system of sewerage
as of house-drainage, so as to make the dwelling-houses
more wholesome and sweet.</p>

<p>To effect this, the great object was the abolition
of the cesspool system, under which filth
must accumulate, and where, from scamped buildings
or other causes, evaporation took place, the
effects of the system were found to be vile and
offensive, and have been pronounced miasmatic.
Having just alluded to these matters, I proceed to
describe the modernly-adopted connection of
house-drainage and street-sewerage.</p>

<p>Experiments, as I have said, were set on foot
under the auspices of public bodies, and the
opinions of eminent engineers, architects, and
surveyors were also taken. Their opinions seem
really to be concentrated in the advocacy of <i>one</i>
remedy&mdash;improved house-drainage; and they
appear to have agreed that the system which is
at present adopted is, under the circumstances, the
best that can be adopted.</p>

<p>I was told also by an eminent practical builder,
perfectly unconnected with any official or public
body, and, indeed, often at issue with surveyors,
&amp;c., that the new system was unquestionably a
great improvement in every respect, and that
some years before its adoption as at present he
had abetted such a system, and had carried it
into effect when he could properly do so.</p>

<p>I will first show the mode and then the cost of
the new system.</p>

<p>I find it designated “back,” “front,” “tubular,”
and “pipe” house-drainage, and all with the
object of carrying off all fæces, soil water, cesspool
matter, &amp;c., before it has had time to accumulate.
It is not by brick or other drains of
masonry that the system is carried out or is recommended
to be carried out, but by means of
tubular earthenware pipes; and for any efficient
carrying out of the projected improvement a
system of <i>constant</i>, and not as at present <i>intermittent</i>,
supply of water from the several companies
would be best. These pipes communicate
with the nearest sewer. The pipes in the
tubular drainage are of red earthenware or stoneware
(pot).</p>

<p>The use of earthenware, clay, or pot pipes for
the conveyance of liquids is very ancient. Mr.
Stirrat, a bleacher in Paisley, in a statement to
the Board of Health, mentioned that clay pipes
were used in ancient times. King Hezekiah
(2nd Book of Kings, chap. 20, and 2nd Book of
Chronicles, chap. 32) brought in water from Jerusalem.
“His pool and conduit,” said Mr.
Stirrat, “are still to be seen. The conduit is
three feet square inside, built of freestone,
strongly cemented; the stone, fifteen inches thick,
evidently intended to sustain a considerable pressure;
and I have seen pipes of clay, taken by a
friend from a house in the ruins of the ancient
city, of one inch bore, and about seven inches in
diameter, proving evidently, to my mind, that
ancient Jerusalem was supplied with water on
the principle of gravitation. The pools or reservoirs
are also at this day in tolerably good
order, one of them still filled with water; the
other broken down in the centre, no doubt by
some besieging enemy, to cut off the supply to
the city.”</p>

<p>The new system to supply the place of the
cesspools is a <i>combined</i>, while the old is principally
a <i>separate</i>, system of house-drainage; but
the new system is equally available for such
separate drainage.</p>

<p>As regards the success of this system the reports
say experiments have been tried in so large
a number of houses, under such varied and, in
many cases, disadvantageous circumstances, that
no doubts whatsoever can remain in the minds of
competent and disinterested persons as to the
efficient self-cleansing action of well-adjusted
tubular drains and sewers, even without any additional
supplies of water.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovick <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“A great number of small 4-inch tubular drains
have been laid down in the several districts, some
for considerable periods. They have been found
to keep themselves clear by the ordinary soil and
drainage waters of the houses. I have no doubt
that pipes of this kind will keep themselves clear
by the ordinary discharge of house-drainage;
assuming, of course, a supply of water, pipes of
good form, and materials properly laid, and with
fair usage.”</p>

<p>“One of the earliest illustrations of the tubular
system,” it is stated in a Report of the Board of
Health, “was given in the improved drainage of a
block of houses in the cloisters of Westminster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
which had been the seat of a severe epidemic fever.
The cesspools and the old drains were filled up,
and an entire system of tubular drainage and
sewerage substituted for the service of that block
of houses.</p>

<p>“The Dean of Westminster, in a letter on the
state of this drainage, says, ‘I beg to report to
the Commissioners that the success of the entire
new pipe-drainage laid down in St. Peter’s College
during the last twelve months has been complete.
I consider this experiment on drainage
and sewage of about fifteen houses to afford a
triumphant proof of the efficacy of draining by
pipes, and of the facility of <i>dispensing entirely
with cesspools and brick sewers</i>.’ Up to this time
they have acted, and continue to act, perfectly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morris, a surveyor attached to the Metropolitan
Sewers Commission, gives the following
account of the action of trial works of improved
house-<span class="lock">drainage:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘I have introduced the new 4-inch tubular
house-drains into some houses for the trustees of
the parish of Poplar, with water-closets, and have
received no just cause of complaint. In every
instance where I have applied it, I found the
system answer extremely well, if a sufficient
quantity of water has been used.</p>

<p>“‘The answer of the householders as to the
effect of the new drainage has invariably been
that they and their families have been better in
health; that they were formerly annoyed with
smells and effluvia, from which they are now
quite free.</p>

<p>“‘Since the new drainage has been laid down
there has been only occasion to go on the ground
to examine it once for the whole year, and that
was from the inefficiency of the water service.
It was found that rags had been thrown down
and had got into the pipe; and further, that very
little water had been used, so that the stoppage
was the fault of the tenant, not of the system.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Gotto, the engineer, having stated that in
a plan for the improvement of Goulston-street,
Whitechapel, not only was the removal of all
cesspools contemplated, but also the substitution
of water-closet apparatus, gave the following estimate
of <i>the cost</i>, provided the pipes were made
and the work done by contract under the Commissioners
of <span class="lock">Sewers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>front</i> tubular drainage of a similar house
(with fifteen yards of carriage-way to be paved)
would cost 6<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 7&frac12;<i>d.</i>; or the drainage would

<p>“The engineering witnesses who have given
their special attention to the subject,” state the
Board of Health, in commenting on the information
I have just cited, “affirm that upon the

of the apparatus in substitution of cesspools would
<i>not greatly exceed one-half the expense</i> of cleaning
the cesspools.”</p>

<p>The engineers have calculated&mdash;stating the
difficulty of coming to a nice calculation&mdash;that
the present system of cesspools entailed an average
expenditure, for cleansing and repairs, of 4<i>d.</i> a

<p>I have mentioned the diversity of opinion as to
the best form, and even material, for a sewer;
and there is the same diversity as to the material,
&amp;c., for house and gully or street-drainage, more
especially in the <i>pipes</i> of the larger volume. The
pipe-drainage of any description is far less in
favour than it was. One reason is that it does
not promote <i>subsoil drainage</i>; another is the
difficulty of repairs if the joints or fittings of
pipes require mending; and then the combination
of the noxious gases is most offensive in its
exhalations, and difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>I was informed by a nightman, used to the
cleansing of drains and to night-work generally,
that when there was any escape from one of the
tubular pipes the stench was more intense than any
he had ever before experienced from any drains on
the old system.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the London Street-Drains.</span></h3>

<p>We have as yet dealt only with the means of
removing the liquid refuse from the houses of the
metropolis. This, as was pointed out at the
commencement of the present subject, consists
principally of the 19,000,000,000 gallons of
water that are annually supplied to the London
residences by mechanical means. But there
still remain the 5,000,000,000 gallons of surface
or rain-water to be carried off from the 1760
miles of streets, and the roofs and yards of the
300,000 houses which now form the British
metropolis. If this immense volume of liquid
were not immediately removed from our thoroughfares
as fast as it fell, many of our streets would
not only be transformed into canals at certain
periods of the year, but perhaps at all times
(except during drought) they would be, if not
impassable, at least unpleasant and unhealthy,
from the puddles or small pools of stagnant
water that would be continually rotting them.
Were such the case, the roads and streets that
we now pride ourselves so highly upon would
have their foundations soddened. “If the surface
of a road be not kept clean so as to admit of
its becoming dry between showers of rain,” said
Lord Congleton, the great road authority, “it
will be rapidly worn away.” Indeed the immediate
removal of rain-water, so as to prevent its
percolating through the surface of the road, and
thereby impairing the foundation, appears to be
one of the main essentials of road-making.</p>

<p>The means of removing this surface water,
especially from the streets of a city where the
rain falls at least every other day throughout the
year, and reaches an aggregate depth of 24 feet
in the course of the twelvemonth, is a matter of
considerable moment. In Paris, and indeed almost
all of the French towns, a channel is formed
in the middle of each thoroughfare, and down
this the water from the streets and houses is continually
coursing, to the imminent peril of all
pedestrians, for the wheels of every vehicle distribute,
as it goes, a muddy shower on either side
of the way.</p>

<p><i>We</i>, however, have not only removed the channels
from the middle to the sides of our streets,
but instituted a distinct system of drainage for
the conveyance of the wet refuse of our
houses to the sewers&mdash;so that there are no longer
(excepting in a very small portion of the suburbs)
open sewers, meandering through our highways;
the consequence is, the surface-water being carried
off from our thoroughfares almost as fast as
it falls, our streets are generally dry and clean.
That there are exceptions to this rule, which are a
glaring disgrace to us, it must be candidly admitted;
but we must at the same time allow,
when we think of the vast extent of the roadways
of the metropolis (1760 miles!&mdash;nearly
one-half the radius of the earth itself), the
deluge of water that annually descends upon
every inch of the ground which we call London
(38,000,000,000 gallons!&mdash;a quantity which is
almost sufficient for the formation of an American
lake), and the vast amount of traffic, over the
greater part of the capital&mdash;the 13,000 vehicles
that daily cross London Bridge, the 11,000 conveyances
that traverse Cheapside in the course of
twelve hours, the 7700 that go through Temple
Bar, and the 6900 that ascend and descend Holborn
Hill between nine in the morning and nine at
night, the 1500 omnibuses and the 3000 cabriolets
that are continually hurrying from one part of the
town to another, and the 10,000 private carriage,
job, and cart horses that incessantly <i>perviate</i> the
metropolis&mdash;when we reflect, I say, on this vast
amount of traffic&mdash;this deluge of rain&mdash;and the
wilderness of streets, it cannot but be allowed
that the cleansing and draining of the London
thoroughfares is most admirably conducted.</p>

<p>The mode of street drainage is by means of
what is called a gully-hole and a gully-drain.</p>

<p><i>The Gully-hole</i><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> is the opening from the surface
of the street (and is seen generally on each side
of the way), into which all the fluid refuse of the
public thoroughfares runs on its course to the sewer.</p>

<p><i>The Gully-drain</i> is a drain generally of earthenware
piping, curving from the side of the street
to an opening in the top or side of the sewer, and
is the means of communication between the sewer
and the gully-hole.</p>

<p>The gully-hole is indicated by an iron grate
being fitted into the surface of the side of a footpath,
where the road slopes gradually from its
centre to the edge of the footpath, and down this
grate the water runs into the channel contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
for it in the construction of the streets. These
gully-grates, the observant pedestrian&mdash;if there
be a man in this hive of London who, without
professional attraction to the matter, regards for a
few minutes the peculiarities of the street (apart
from the houses) which he is traversing&mdash;an observant
pedestrian, I say, would be struck at the
constantly-recurring grates in a given space in
some streets, and their paucity in others. In
Drury-lane there is no gully-grate, as you walk
down from Holborn to where Drury-lane becomes
Wych-street; whilst in some streets, not a tenth
of the length of Drury-lane, there may be three,
four, five, or six grates. The reason is this:&mdash;There
is no sewer running down Drury-lane; a
contiguous sewer, however, runs down Great
Wyld-street, draining, where there are drains, the
hundred courts and nooks of the poor, between
Drury-lane and Lincoln’s-inn-fields, as well as the
more open places leading down towards the proximity
of Temple Bar. This Great Wyld-street
sewer, moreover, in its course to Fleet Bridge, is
made available for the drainage (very grievously
deficient, according to some of the reports of the
Board of Health) of Clare-market. Grates would
of course be required in such a place as Drury-lane,
only the street is thought to be sufficiently on the
descent to convey the surface-water to the grate
in Wych-street.</p>

<p>The parts in which the gully-grates will be
found the most numerous are where the main
streets are most intersected by other main streets,
or by smaller off-streets, and indeed wherever the
streets, of whatever size, continually intersect each
other, as they do off nearly all the great street-thoroughfares
in the City. Although the sewers
may not be according to the plan of the streets,
the gully-grates must nevertheless be found at the
street intersections, whether the nearest point to
the sewer or not, or else the water would not be
quickly carried off, and would form a nuisance.</p>

<p>I am informed, on good authority, both as regards
the City and Metropolitan Commissions,
that the average distance of the gully-grates is
thirty yards one from another, including both sides
of the way. Their number does not depend upon
population, but simply on the local characteristics
of the highways; for of course the rain falls into
all the streets in proportion to their size, whether
populous or half-empty localities. As, however,
the more distant roads have not such an approximation
of grates, and the law which requires their
formation is by no means&mdash;and perhaps, without
unnecessary interference, cannot be&mdash;very definite,
I am informed that it may fairly be represented,
that, of the 1760 miles of London public ways,
more than two-thirds, “or” remarked one informant,
“say 1200 miles, are grated on <i>each</i> side of
the street or road, at distances of sixty yards.”
This would give 59 gully-holes in every one of the
1200 miles of street said to be so supplied. Hence
the total number throughout the metropolis will
be 70,800.</p>

<p><i>The gully-drain</i>, which is the street-drain, always
presents now a sloping curve, describing,
more or less, part of a circle. This drain starts,
so to speak, from the side of the street, while its
course to the sewer, in order to economize space,
is made by any most appropriate curve, to include
the reception of as great a quantity of wet street-refuse
as possible; for if the gully-drains were
formed in a direct, or even a not-very-indirect line,
from the street sides to the sewers, they would not
only be more costly, more numerous, but would,
in fact, as I was told, “choke the under-ground”
of London, for now the subterranean capital is so
complicated with gas, water, and drain-pipes, that
such a system as will allow room for each is indispensable.
The new system is, moreover, more
economical. In the City the gully-drains are nearly
all of nine-inch diameter in tubular pipeage. In
the metropolitan jurisdiction they are the same,
but not to the same extent, some being only six
inches.</p>

<p>Fifty, or even thirty years ago, the old street
channels for gully drainage were costly constructions,
for they were made so as to suit sewers
which were cleansed by the street being taken
“up,” and the offensive deposit, thick and even
indurated as it often was in those days, drawn to
the surface. Some few were three and even four
feet square; some two feet six inches wide, and
three or four feet high; all of brick. I am assured
that of the extent or cost of these old contrivances
no accounts have been preserved, but that they
were more than twice as costly as the present
method.</p>

<p>In all the reports I have seen, metropolitan or
city&mdash;the statements of the flushermen being to the
same purport&mdash;there are complaints as to the uses to
which the gully-holes are put in many parts, every
kind of refuse admissible through the bars of the
grate being stealthily emptied down them. The
paviours, if they have an opportunity, sweep their
surplus grout into the gullies, and so do the scavagers
with their refuse occasionally, though this
is generally done in the less-frequented parts, to
get rid of the “slop,” which is valueless.</p>

<p>In a report, published in 1851, Mr. Haywood
points out the prevalence of the practice of using
the gully-gratings as dustbins! A sewer under
Billingsgate accumulated in a few months many
cart-loads, composed almost wholly of fish-shells;
and 114 cart-loads of fish-shells, cinders, and
rubbish were removed from the sewers in the
vicinity of Middlesex-street (Petticoat-lane);
these had accumulated in about twelve months.
“Reconstructing the gullies,” he says, “so as to
intercept improper substances (which has been
recently done at Billingsgate), might prevent this
material reaching the sewers, but it would still
have to be removed from the gullies, and would
thus still cause perpetual expense. Indeed, I feel
convinced that nothing but making public example
by convicting and punishing some offenders, under
clause 69 of ‘The City of London Sewers’ Act,’
will stop the practice, so universal in the poorer
localities, of using the gullies as dustbins.”</p>

<p><i>The Gully-holes are now trapped</i>&mdash;with very few
exceptions, one report states, while another report
intimates that gully-trapping has no exception at all.
The trap is resorted to so that the effluvium from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
a gully-drain may not infect the air of the public
ways; but among engineers and medical sanitary
inquirers, there is much difference of opinion as
to whether the system of trapping is desirable or
not. The general opinion seems to be, however,
that all gullies should be trapped.</p>

<p>Of the City gully-traps, Mr. Haywood, in a report
for the year 1851, says, as regards the period of
their <span class="lock">introduction:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“About seventeen years ago your then surveyor
(Mr. Kelsey) applied the first traps to sewer gullies,
and from that date to the present the trapping of
gullies has been adopted as a principle, and the
city of London is still, I believe, the only metropolitan
area in which the gullies are all trapped.
The traps first constructed have since been (as all
first inventions or adaptations ever have or will
be) improved upon, and are rapidly being displaced
by those of more improved construction.</p>

<p>“Now, of the incompatible conditions required
of gully-traps, of the difficulty of obtaining such
mechanical appliances so effective and perfect as
can <i>theoretically</i> be devised, but yet of the extreme
desirability of obtaining them as perfect as modern
science could produce, your honourable court has,
at least, for as long as I have had the honour of
holding office under you, been fully alive to; no
prejudice has opposed impediment to the introduction
of novelties; your court has been always
open to inventors, and, at the present time, there
are sixteen different traps or modes of trapping
gullies under trial within your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>“Nor has the provision of the means of excluding
effluvium from the atmosphere been your
only care; but the cleanliness of the sewers, and
the prevention of accumulation of decomposing
refuse, both by regulated cleansings, and by constructing
the sewage upon the most improved
principles, have also been your aim and that of
your officers; and I do not hesitate to assert, that
the offensiveness of the escape from the gullies
has been of late years much diminished by the
care bestowed upon the condition of the sewers.</p>

<p>“374 gullies have been retrapped in the City
upon improved principles during the last year.”</p>

<p>The gully-traps are on the principle of self-acting
valves, but it is stated in several reports,
that these valves often remain permanently open,
partly from the street refuse (especially if mixed
with the débris from new or removed buildings)
not being sufficiently liquified to pass through
them, and partly from the hinges getting rusted,
and so becoming fixed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Length of the London Sewers and
Drains.</span></h3>

<p>There is no official account precisely defining the
length of the London sewerage; but the information
acquired on the subject leaves no doubt as to
the accuracy of the following facts.</p>

<p>About 900 miles of sewers of the metropolis
may be said to have been surveyed; and it is
known that from 100 to 150 miles more constitute
a portion of the metropolitan sewerage; this, too,
independently of that of the City, which is 50
miles. Altogether I am assured that the sewers
of the urban part of London, included within the
58 square miles before mentioned, measure 1100
miles.</p>

<p>The classes of sewers comprised in this long
extent are pretty equally apportioned, each a
third, or 366 miles, of the first, second, and third
classes respectively. Of this extent about 200
miles are still, in the year 1852, <i>open</i> sewers!&mdash;to
say nothing of the great open sewer, the Thames.
The open sewers are found principally in the
Surrey districts, in Brixton, Lewisham, Tooting,
and places at the like distance from the more
central parts of the Commissioners’ jurisdiction.
These open sewers, however, are disappearing,
and it is intended that in time no such places
shall exist; as it is, some miles of them are inclosed
yearly. The open sewers in what may be
considered more of the heart of the metropolis are
a portion of the Fleet-ditch in Clerkenwell, and
places in Lambeth and Bermondsey, or about 20
miles in the interior to 180 miles in the exterior
portion of the capital. These are national disgraces.</p>

<p>The 1100 miles above-mentioned, however, include
only the sewers, comprising neither the house
nor gully-drains. According to the present laws,
all newly-built houses must be drained into the
sewers; and in 1850 there were 5000 applications
from the western districts alone to the Commissioners,
for the promotion of the drainage of
that number of old and new houses into the
sewers, the old houses having been previously
drained into cesspools.</p>

<p>I am assured, on good authority, that fully one-half
of the houses in the metropolis are at the
present time drained into the sewers. In one
street, about a century old, containing in the portion
surveyed for an official purpose, on the two
sides of the way, 76 houses, the number was
found to be equally divided&mdash;half the drainage
being into sewers and half into cesspools. The
number of houses in the metropolis proper, of
115 square miles area, is 307,722. The majority,
as far as is officially known, are now drained
into the public sewers, or into private or branch
sewers communicating with the larger public
receptacles, so that&mdash;allowing 200,000 houses
to be included in the 58 square miles of the
urban sewerage, and admitting that some wretched
dwelling-places are not drained at all&mdash;it is reasonable
to assume that at least 100,000 houses
within this area are drained into the sewers.</p>

<p>The average length of the house-drains is, I
learn from the best sources, 50 feet per house.
The builder of a new house is now required by
law to drain it, at the proprietor’s cost, 100 feet,
if necessary, to a sewer. In some instances, in
detached houses, where the owners object to the
cesspool system, a house drain has been carried
230 feet to a sewer, and sometimes even farther;
but in narrow or moderately wide streets, from
18 to 26 feet across, and in alleys and narrow
places (in case there is sewerage) the house drains
may be but from 12 to 20 feet. Both these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
lengths of drainage are exceptions, and there is
no question that the average length may be put
at 50 feet. In some squares, for example, the
sewer runs along the centre, so that the house-drains
here are in excess of the 50 feet average.</p>

<p>The length of the house-drainage of the more
central part of London, assuming 100,000 houses
to be drained into the sewers, and each of such
drains to be on the average 50 feet long, is, then,
5,000,000 feet, or about 2840 miles.</p>

<p>But there are still the street or gully-drains
for the surface-water to be estimated. In the
Holborn and Finsbury division alone, the length
of the “main covered sewers” is said to be 83
miles; the length of “smaller sewers” to carry
off the surface-water from the streets 16 miles;
the length of drains leading from houses to the
main sewers, 264.</p>

<p>Now, if there be 16 miles of gully-drains to
83 miles of main covered sewers, and the same
proportion hold good throughout the 58 square
miles over which the sewers extend, it follows
that there would be about 200 miles of gully-drains
to the gross 1100 miles of sewers.</p>

<p>But this is only an approximate result. The
length and character of the gully-drains I find
to vary very considerably. If the streets where
the gully-grates are found have no sewer in a line
with the thoroughfare, still the water must be
drained off and conveyed to the nearest sewer, of
any class, large or small, and consequently at much
greater length than if there were a sewer running
down the street. Neither is the number of the
gully-holes any sure criterion of the measurement
of the gully-drains, for where the intersections are,
and consequently the gully-holes frequent, a number,
sometimes amounting to ten, are made to empty
their contents into the same gully-drain. Neither
do the returns of yearly expenditure, presented to
Parliament by the Metropolitan Court of Sewers,
supply information. But even if the exact length,
and the exact price paid for the formation of that
length, were given, it would supply but <i>the year’s</i>
outlay as regards the additions or repairs that had
been made to the gully-drains, and certainly not
furnish us with the original cost of the whole.</p>

<p>One experienced informant told me&mdash;but let me
premise that I heard from all the gentlemen whom
I consulted, a statement that they could only
compute by analogy with other facts bearing upon
the subject&mdash;was confident, that taking only 1200
miles of public way as gully-drained, that extent
might be considered as the length of the gully-drains
themselves. Even calculating such drains
to run from each side of the public way, which is
generally the case, I am told that, considering the
economy of underground space which is now
necessary, the length of 1200 miles is as fair an
estimate for gully-drainage (apart from other
drainage) as for the length of the streets so
gullied.</p>

<p>Hence we have, for the gross extent of the
whole sewers and drains of the metropolis, the
following result,&mdash;</p>

<p>The island of Great Britain, I may observe, is,
at its extreme points, 550 miles from north to
south, and 290 from east to west. It would, therefore,
appear that the main sewers of the capital
are just double the length of the whole island, from
the English Channel to John-o’-Groats, and nearly
three times longer than the greatest width of the
country. But this is the extent of the sewerage
alone. The drainage of London is about equal in
length to the diameter of the earth itself!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cost of Constructing the Sewers
and Drains of the Metropolis.</span></h3>

<p>The money actually expended in constructing
the 1100 miles of sewers and 4000 miles of
drains, even if we were only to date from Jan. 1,
1800, is not and never can be known. They
have been built at intervals, as the metropolis, so
to speak, <i>grew</i>. They were built also in many
sizes and forms, and at many variations of price,
according to the depth from the surface, the good
or bad management, or the greater or lesser extent
of jobbery or “patronage” in the several
independent commissions. Accounts were either
not presented in “the good old times,” or not
preserved.</p>

<p>Had the 1100 miles of sewers to be constructed
anew, they would be, according to the present
prices paid by the Commissioners&mdash;not including
digging or such extraneous labour, but the cost
of the sewer only&mdash;as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">366 miles of sewers of the first class, or 1,932,480 feet, at 15<i>s.</i> per foot</td><td>£1,449,360</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left">Same length of third class, at 9<i>s.</i> per foot</td><td>869,616</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total cost of the sewers of the metropolis</td><td class="total">£3,381,840</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>As this is a lower charge than was paid for
the construction of more than three-fourths of the
sewers, we may fairly assume that their cost
amounted to from three millions and a half to
four millions of pounds sterling.</p>

<p>The majority of the house-drains running into
the sewers are brick, and seldom less than 9 inches
square; sometimes, in the old brick drains, they
are some inches larger, and in the very old drains,
and in some 100 years old, wooden planks were
often used instead of a brick or stone construction,
for the sake of reducing cost, and replaced when
rotted. The wood, in many cases, soon decayed,
and since 1847 no wooden sewers have been
allowed to be formed, nor any old ones to be repaired
with new wood; the work must be of
stone or brick, if not pipeage. About two-thirds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of the drains running from the houses to the
sewers are brick; the remaining third tubular, or
earthenware pipes. The cost, if now to be formed,
would be somewhat as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">1893⅓ miles of brick drains, 5<i>s.</i> per foot, as average of sizes</td><td>£2,499,200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">945⅔ feet of tubular drains, average of sizes 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></td><td>624,800</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Total cost of the house-drains of London</td><td class="total">£3,124,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The cost of the street or gully drains have still
to be estimated.</p>

<p>The present cost of the 9-inch gully-pipe drains
is about 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a foot; of the 6-inch, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Of
the proportionate lengths of these two classes of
street-drains I have not been able to gain any
account, for, I believe, it has never been ascertained
in any way approaching to a total return.
Taking 1200 miles, however, as quite within the
full length of the gully-drains, and calculating at
the low average of 3<i>s.</i> the foot for the whole, the
total cost of the street-drains of the metropolis
would be 950,400<i>l.</i>, or, I am assured, one might
say a million sterling, and this, even if all were
done at the present low prices; the original cost
would, of course, have been much greater.</p>

<p>Hence, according to the above calculations, we
have the following</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Uses of Sewers as a Means of
Subsoil Drainage.</span></h3>

<p>There is one other purpose toward which a sewer
is available&mdash;a purpose, too, which I do not remember
to have seen specified in the Metropolitan
Reports.</p>

<p>“The first, and perhaps most important purpose
of sewers, as respects health,” says the
Report of Messrs. Walker, Cubitt, and Brunel
(1848), “is, <i>as under-drains to the surrounding
earth</i>. They answer this purpose so effectually
and quietly, and have done it so long, that
their importance in this respect is overlooked.
In the Sanitary Commissioners’ Reports we do
not find it once noticed, and the recommendation
of the substitution of stone or earthenware
pipes for the larger brick sewers, seems to show,
that any provision for the <i>under-drainage</i> was
thought unnecessary, although such a provision is
in our opinion most important.</p>

<p>“Under the artificial ground, the collection of
ages, which in the City of London, as in most
ancient towns, forms the upper surface, is a considerable
thickness of clean gravel, and under the
gravel is the London clay. The present houses
are founded chiefly on the artificial or ‘made
ground,’ while the sewers are made through the
gravel; and it is known practically, that however
charged with water the gravel of a district may
be, the springs for a considerable distance round
are drawn down by making a sewer, and the
wells that had water within a few feet of the surface
have again to be sunk below the bottom of
the sewer to reach the water. Every interstice
between the stones of the gravel acts as an under-drain
to conduct the water to the sewer, through
the sides of which it finds its way, even if mortar
be used in the construction.</p>

<p>“Hence the salubrity of a gravel foundation,
if the water be drawn out of it by sewers or
other means, as is the case with the City and
with Westminster. A proof of this principle
was afforded by the result of a reference to physicians
and engineers in 1838, to inquire into the
state of drainage and smells in and near Buckingham
Palace, as to which there had been complaints,
though none so heavy as Mr. Phillips
now makes, when he says, ‘that the drainage of
Buckingham Palace is extremely defective, and
that its precincts are reeking with filth and pestilential
odours from the absence of proper sewerage!’”</p>

<p>The Report then shows the pains that were
taken to ensure dryness in the Palace. Pits were
dug in the garden 14 feet below the surface, and
3&frac12; feet below high-water mark in the river, and
they were found dry to the bottom. The kitchens
and yard of the palace are, however, only 18
inches above Trinity high-water mark in the
Thames, and therefore 18 inches below a very
high tide. The physician, Sir James Clarke,
and the engineers, Messrs. Simpson and Walker,
in a separate Report, spoke in terms of commendation
of the drainage of the Palace in 1838,
as promotive of dryness. Since that time a connecting
chain has been made from the Palace
drains into the canal in St. James’s-park, to
prevent the wet from rising as formerly during
heavy rains. “The Palace,” it is stated in the
Report of the three engineers, “should not be
classed with the low part of Pimlico, where the
drainage is, we believe, very defective, and to
which, for anything we know to the contrary, the
character given by Mr. Phillips may be applicable.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, for this array of opinions
of high authority, and despite the advantages
of a gravel bed for the substratum of the palatial
sewerage, the drainage and sewerage about
Buckingham Palace is more frequently than that
of any other public place under repair, and is
always requiring attention. It was only a few
days ago, before the court left Windsor Castle for
London, that men were employed night and day,
on the drains and cesspoolage channels, to make,
as one of them described it to me&mdash;and such
working-men’s descriptions are often forcible&mdash;“the
place <i>decent</i>. I was hardly ever,” he added, “in
such a set of stinks as I’ve been in the sewers
and underground parts of the palace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the City Sewerage.</span></h3>

<p>As yet I have spoken only of the sewers of London<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
“without the City;” but the sewers within
the City, though connected, for the general public
drainage and sewerage of the capital, with the
works under the control of the Metropolitan Commissioners,
are in a distinct and strictly defined
jurisdiction, superintended by City Commissioners,
and managed by City officers, and consequently
demand a special notice.</p>

<p>The account of the City sewers, however,
may be given with a comparative brevity, for the
modes of their construction, as well as their
general management, do not differ from what I
have described as pertaining to the extra-civic
metropolis. There are, nevertheless, a few distinctions
which it is proper to point out.</p>

<p>The City sewers are the oldest in the capital,
for the very plain reason that the City itself, in
its site, if not now in its public and private buildings,
is the oldest part of London, as regards the
abode of a congregated body of people.</p>

<p>The ages (so to speak) of these sewers, vary,
for the most part, according to the dates of the
City’s rebuilding after the Great Fire, and according
to the dates of the many alterations, improvements,
removal or rebuilding of new streets,
markets, &amp;c., which have been effected since that
period. Before the Great Fire of 1666, all drainage
seems, with a few exceptions, to have been
fortuitous, unconnected, and superficial.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> public sewer built after this important
epoch in the history of London was in Ludgate-street
and hill. This was the laudable work of
the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s, and was constructed
at the instance, it is said, and after the
plans, of Sir Christopher Wren. There is, perhaps,
no official or documentary proof of this, for
the proclamations from the King in council, the
Acts of Parliament, and the resolutions of the
Corporation of the City of London at that important
period, are so vague and so contradictory,
and were so frequently altered or abrogated, and so
frequently disregarded, that it is more impossible
than difficult to get at the truth. Of the fact
which I have just mentioned, however, there need
be no doubt; nor that the <i>second</i> public City
sewer was in Fleet-street, commenced in 1668,
the second year after the fire.</p>

<p>There are, nevertheless, older sewers than this,
but the dates of their construction are not known;
we have proof merely that they existed in old
London, or as it was described by an anonymous
writer (quoted, if I remember rightly, in Maitland’s
“History of London”), London “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante
ignem</i>”&mdash;London before the fire. These sewers,
or rather portions of sewers, are severally near
Newgate, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital sewer, and
that of the Irongate by the Tower.</p>

<p>The sewer, however, which may be pointed
out as the most remarkable is that of Little
Moorgate, London-wall. It is formed of red tiles;
and from such being its materials, and from the
circumstance of some Roman coins having been
found near it, it is supposed by some to be of
Roman construction, and of course coeval with
that people’s possession of the country. This sewer
has a flat bottom, upright sides, and a circular
arch at its top; it is about 5 feet by 3 feet. The
other older sewers present much about the same
form; and an Act in the reign of Charles II.
directs that sewers shall be so built, but that the
bottom shall have a circular curve.</p>

<p>I am informed by a City gentleman&mdash;one taking
an interest in such matters&mdash;that this sewer
has troubled the repose of a few civic antiquaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
some thinking that it was a Roman sewer, while
others scouted such a notion, arguing that the
Romans were not in the habit of doing their work
by halves; and that if they had sewered London,
great and enduring remains would have been discovered,
for their main sewer would have been a
solid construction, and directed to the Thames, as
was and is the Cloaca Maxima, in the Eternal
City, to the Tiber. Others have said that the
sewer in question was merely built of Roman
materials, perhaps first discovered about the time,
having originally formed a reservoir, tank, or
even a bath, and were keenly appropriated by
some economical or scheming builder or City
official.</p>

<p>“That the Britons,” says Tacitus in his “Life
of Agricola,” “who led a roaming life, and were
easily incited to war, might contract a love
for peace, by being accustomed to a pleasanter
mode of life, Agricola assisted them to build
houses, temples, and market-places. By praising
the diligent and upbraiding the idle, he excited
such emulation among the Britons, that, after they
had erected all those necessary buildings in their
towns, they built others for pleasure and ornament,
as porticoes, galleries, <i>baths</i>, and banqueting-houses.”</p>

<p>The sewers of the city of London are, then, a
comparatively modern work. Indeed, three-fourths
of them may be called modern. The
earlier sewers were&mdash;as I have described under
the general head&mdash;ditches, which in time were
arched over, but only gradually and partially, as
suited the convenience or the profit of the owners
of property alongside those open channels, some
of which thus presented the appearance of a
series of small uncouth-looking bridges. When
these bridges had to be connected so as to form
the summit of a continuous sewer, they presented
every variety of arch, both at their outer and
under sides; those too near the surface had to be
lowered. Some of these sewers, however, were
in the first instances connected, despite difference
of size and irregularity of form. The result may
be judged from the account I have given of the
strange construction of some of the Westminster
sewers, under the head of “subterranean survey.”</p>

<p>How modern the City sewers are may best be
estimated from the following table of what may
be called the dates of their construction. The
periods are given decennially as to the progress of
the formation of <i>new</i> <span class="lock">sewers:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Thus the length made in the 20 years previous
to 1847 was more than double all that was made
during the preceding 120 years; while in the ten
years from 1837 to 1847, the addition to the
lineal extent of sewerage was very nearly equal to
all that had been made in 130 years previously.</p>

<p>This addition of 127,435 feet, or rather more
than 24 miles, seems but a small matter when
“London” is thought of; but the reader must be
reminded that only a small portion (comparatively)
of the metropolis is here spoken of, and the entire
length of the City sewerage, at the close of 1847,
was but 44 miles; so that the additions I have
specified as having been made since 1837, were
more than one-half of the whole. The <i>re</i>-constructions
are not included in the metage I have
given, for, as the new sewers generally occupied the
same site as the old, they did not add to the
length of the whole.</p>

<p>The total length of the City sewerage was, on
the 31st December, 1851, no less than 49 miles;
while the entire public way was at the same recent
period, 51 miles (containing about 1000 separate
and distinct streets, lanes, courts, alleys, &amp;c., &amp;c.);
and I am assured that in another year or so, not
a furlong of the whole City will be unsewered.</p>

<p>The more ancient sewers usually have upright
walls, a flat or slightly-curved invert, and a semicircular
or gothic arch. The form of such as have
been built apparently more than 20 years ago, is
that of two semicircles, of which the upper has a
greater radius, connected by sloping side walls;
those of recent construction are egg-shaped. The
main lines are not unfrequently elliptic; in the case
of the Fleet, and other ancient affluents of the
Thames, the forms and dimensions vary considerably.
Instances occur of sewers built entirely of
stone; but the material is almost invariably brick,
most commonly 9 inches in substance; the larger
sewers 14, and sometimes 18 inches.</p>

<p>The falls or inclinations in the course of the
City sewerage vary greatly, as much as from 1 in
240 to 1 in 24, or, in the first case, from a fall of
22 feet, in the latter, of course, to ten times such
fall, or 220 feet per mile. There are, moreover,
a few cases in which the inclination is as small as
1 in 960; others where it is as high as 1 in 14.
This irregularity is to be accounted for, partly by
the want of system in the old times, and partly
from the natural levels of the ground. The want
of system and the indifference shown to providing
a proper fall, even where it was not difficult, was
more excusable a few years back than it would be
at the present time, for when some of these
sewers were built, the drainage of the house-refuse
into them was not contemplated.</p>

<p>The number of houses drained into the City
sewers is, as precisely as such a matter can be
ascertained, 11,209; the number drained into the
cesspools is 5030. This shows a preponderance
of drainage into the sewers of 6179. The length
of the house-drains in the City, at an average of
50 feet to each house, may be estimated at upwards
of 106 miles. These City drains are included in
the general computation of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The gully-drains in the City are more frequent
than in other parts of the metropolis, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
continual intersection of streets, &amp;c., and perhaps
from a closer care of the sewerage and all matters
connected with it. The general average of the
gully-drains I have shown to be 59 for every mile
of street. I am assured that in the City the
street-drains may be safely estimated at 65 to the
mile. Estimating the streets gullied within the
City, then, at an average of 50 miles, or about a
mile more than the sewers, the number of gully-drains
is 3250, and the length of them about 50
miles; but these, like the house-drains, have been
already included in the metropolitan enumeration.</p>

<p>The actual sum expended yearly upon the construction,
and repairs, and improvements of the
City sewers cannot be cited as a distinct item,
because the Court makes the return of the aggregate
annual expenditure, as regards pavement,
cleansing, and the matters specified as the general
expenditure under the Court of Commissioners of
the City Sewers. The cost, however, of the
construction of sewers comprised within the civic
boundaries is included in the general metropolitan
estimate before given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Outlets, Ramifications, etc., of
the Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>In this enumeration I speak only of the
<i>public</i> outlets into the river, controlled and regulated
by public officers.</p>

<p>The orifices or mouths of the sewers where
they discharge themselves into the Thames, beginning
from their eastern, and following them
seriatim to their western extremity, are as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Limehouse Hole.</li>
<li>Irongate Wharf.</li>
<li>Ratcliffe Cross.</li>
<li>Fox-lane, Shadwell.</li>
<li>London Dock.</li>
<li>St. Katharine’s Dock.</li>
<li>The eleven City outlets, which I shall specify hereafter.</li>
<li>Essex-street, Strand.</li>
<li>Norfolk-street, Strand.</li>
<li>Durham Hill (or Adelphi).</li>
<li>Northumberland-street.</li>

<li>Cubitt’s (also in Pimlico).</li>
<li>Chelsea Bridge.</li>
<li>Fulham Bridge.</li>
<li>Hammersmith Bridge.</li>
<li>Sandford Bridge (into a sort of creek of the Thames), or near the four bridges.</li>
<li>Twickenham.</li>
<li>Hampton.</li>
<li>In all, 32.</li>

</ul>

<p>It might only weary the reader to enumerate
the outlets on the Surrey side of the Thames,
which are 28 in number, so that the public sewer
outlets of the whole metropolis are 60 in all.</p>

<p>The public sewer outlets from the City of London
into the Thames are, as I have said, eleven
in number, or rather they are usually represented
as eleven, though in reality there are twelve such
orifices&mdash;the “Upper” and “Eastern” Custom-House
Sewers (which are distinct) being computed
as one. These outlets, generally speaking
the most ancient in the whole metropolis, <span class="lock">are&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>London Bridge.</li>
<li>Ancient Walbrook.</li>
<li>Paul’s Wharf.</li>
<li>The Fleet-street Sewer at Blackfriars Bridge.</li>
<li>(I mention these four first, because they are the largest outlets).</li>
<li>Tower Dock.</li>
<li>Pool Quay.</li>
<li>Custom House.</li>
<li>New Walbrook.</li>
<li>Dowgate Dock.</li>
<li>Hamburg Wharf.</li>
<li>Puddle Dock.</li>
</ul>


<p>Until recently, there was also Whitefriars Docks,
but this is now attached to the Fleet Sewer
outlet.</p>

<p>The Fleet Sewer is the oldest in London. No
portion of the ditch or river composing it is now
uncovered within the jurisdiction of the City; but
until a little more than eleven years ago a portion
of it, north of Holborn, was uncovered, and had
been uncovered for years. Indeed, as I have before
intimated, barges and small craft were employed
on the Fleet River, and the City determined
to “encourage its navigation.” Even the
“polite” Earl of Chesterfield, a century ago (for
his lordship was born in 1694, and died in 1773),
when asked by a Frenchman in Paris, if there
was in London a river to compare to the Seine? replied
that there certainly was, and it was called
Fleet Ditch! This is now the sewer; but it was
not a covered sewer until 1765, when the Corporation
ordered it to be built over.</p>

<p>The next oldest sewer outlet is that at London
Bridge, and London antiquaries are not agreed as
to whether it or the Fleet is the oldest.</p>

<p>The Fleet Sewer at Blackfriars Bridge is 18 feet
high; between Tudor-street and Fleet Bridge
(about the foot of Ludgate-hill), 14 feet 3 inches
high; at Holborn Bridge, 13 feet; and in its continuation
in the long-unfinished Victoria-street,
12 feet 3 inches. In all these localities it
is 12 feet wide.</p>

<p>The New London Bridge Sewer, built or rebuilt,
wholly or partly, in 1830, is 10 feet by
8 at its outlet; decreasing to the south end of
King William-street, where it is 9 feet by 7;
while it is 8 feet by 7 in Moorgate-street.</p>

<p>Paul’s Wharf sewer is 7 feet 6 inches by 5 feet
6 inches near the outlet.</p>

<p>With the one exception of the Fleet River, none
of the City sewer outlets are covered, the Fleet
outlet being covered even at low water. The
issue from the others runs in open channels upon
the shore.</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood (February 12, 1850), in a report
of the City Sewer Transactions and Works, observes,&mdash;“During
the year (1849) the outlet sewers
at Billingsgate and Whitefriars, two of the outlets
of main sewers which discharged at the line of
the River Wall, have been diverted (times of
storm excepted); there remain, therefore, but
eleven main outlets within the jurisdiction of this
commission, which discharge their waters at the
line of the River Wall.</p>

<p>“As a temporary measure, it is expedient to
convey the sewage of the whole of the outlets
within the City by covered culverts, below low-water
mark; this subject has been under the consideration
both of this Commission and the Navigation
Committee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the covered culvert is better than
the open run, is a matter disputed among engineers
(as are very many other matters connected
with sewerage), and one into which I need not
enter.</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood says further:&mdash;“The Fleet
sewer already discharges its average flow, by a
culvert, below low-water mark; with one exception
only, I believe, none of the numerous outlets,
which, for a length of many miles, discharge at
intervals into the Thames at the line of the
River Wall, both within and without your jurisdiction,
discharge by culverts in a similar manner.”</p>

<p>These eleven outlets are far from being the
whole number which give their contents into “the
silver bosom of the Thames,” along the bank-line
of the City jurisdiction. There are (including the
11) 182 outlets; but these are not under the
control (unless in cases of alteration, nuisance,
&amp;c.) of the Court of Sewers. They are the outlets
from the drainage of the wharfs, public buildings,
or manufactories (such as gas-works, &amp;c.) on the
banks of the river; and the right to form such
outlets having been obtained from the Navigation
Committee, who, under the Lord Mayor, are
conservators of the Thames, the care of them is
regarded as a private matter, and therefore does
not require further notice in this work. The
officers of the City Court of Sewers observe
these outlets in their rounds of inspection, but
interfere only on application from any party concerned,
unless a nuisance be in existence.</p>

<p>To convey a more definite notion of the extent
and ramified sweep of the sewers, I will now
describe (for the first time in print) some of the
chief <i>Sewer Ramifications</i>, and then show the
proportionate or average number of public ways,
of inhabited houses, and of the population to
each great main sewer, distinguishing, in this
instance, those as <i>great main sewers</i> which have
an outlet into the Thames.</p>

<p>The reader should peruse the following accounts
with the assistance of a map of the environs, for,
thus aided, he will be better able to form a definite
notion of the curiously-mixed and blended
extent of the sewerage already spoken of.</p>

<p>First, then, as to the ramifications of the great
and ancient Fleet outlet. From its mouth, so to
speak, near Blackfriars Bridge, its course is not
parallel with any public way, but, running somewhat
obliquely, it crosses below Tudor-street into
Bridge-street, Blackfriars, then occupies the centre
of Farringdon-street, and that street’s prolongation
or intended prolongation into the New Victoria-street
(the houses in this locality having been
pulled down long ago, and the spot being now
popularly known as “the ruins”), and continues
until the City portion of the Fleet Sewer meets
the Metropolitan jurisdiction between Saffron and
Mutton hills, the junction, so to call it, being
“under the houses”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> (a common phrase among flushermen).
A little farther on it connects itself with
an open part of the Fleet Ditch, running at the
back of Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. In its City
course, the sewer receives the issue from 150
public ways (including streets, alleys, courts,
lanes, &amp;c.), which are emptied into it from the
second, third, or smaller class sewers, from Ludgate-hill
and its proximate streets, the St. Paul’s
locality, Fleet-street and its adjacent communications
in public ways, with a series of sewers
running down from parts of Smithfield, &amp;c. The
<i>greatest</i> accession of sewage, however, which the
Fleet receives from <i>one</i> issue, is a few yards
beyond where the City has merged into the
Metropolitan jurisdiction; this accession is from
a first-class sewer, known as “the Whitecross-street
sewer,” because running from that street,
and carrying into the Fleet the contributions of
60 crowded streets.</p>

<p>After the junction of the covered City sewer
with the uncovered ditch in Clerkenwell, the
Fleet-river sewer (again covered) skirts round
Cold Bath Fields Prison (the Middlesex House of
Correction), runs through Clerkenwell-green into
the Bagnigge Wells-road, so on to Battle-bridge
and King’s-cross; then along the Old Saint Pancras-road,
and thence to the King’s-road (a name
now almost extinct), where the St. Pancras Workhouse
stands close by the turnpike-gate. Along
Upper College-street (Camden-town) is then the
direction of this great sewer, and running <i>under</i>
the canal at the higher part of Camden-town,
near the bridge by the terminus of the Great
North Western Railway, it branches into the
highways and thoroughfares of Kentish-town, of
Highgate, and of Hampstead, respectively, and
then, at what one informant described as “the
outside” of those places, receives the open ditches,
which form the further sewerage, under the control
of the Commissioners, who cause them to be
cleansed regularly.</p>

<p>In order to show more consecutively the direction,
from place to place, in straight, devious, or
angular course, of this the most remarkable sewer
of the world, considering the extent of the drainage
into it, I have refrained from giving beyond
the Whitecross-street connection with the Fleet,
an account of the number of streets sewered into
this old civic stream. I now proceed to supply
the deficiency.</p>

<p>From a large outlet at Clerkenwell-green (a
very thickly-built neighbourhood) flows the connected
sewage of 100 streets. At Maiden-lane,
beyond King’s-cross, a district which is now being
built upon for the purposes of the Great Northern
Railway, the sewage of 10 streets is poured into
it. In the course of this sewer along Camden-town,
it receives the issue of some 20 branches, or
40 streets, &amp;c. About 15 other issues are received
before the open ditches of Kentish-town, Highgate,
and Hampstead are encountered.</p>

<p>It is not, however, merely the sewage collected
in the precincts of the City proper, which is “outletted”
(as I heard a flusherman call it) into the
Thames. Other districts are drained into the
large City outlets nearing the river. “Many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
your works,” says Mr. Haywood, the City surveyor,
in a report addressed to the City Commissioners,
Oct. 23, 1849, “have been beneficially
felt by districts some miles distant from the City.
Twenty-nine outlets have been provided by you
for the sewage of the County of Middlesex; the
high land of and about Hampstead, drains through
the Fleet sewer; Holloway and a portion of Islington
can now be drained by the London Bridge
sewer; Norton Folgate and the densely-populated
districts adjacent are also relieved by it.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Irongate sewer (one of
the most important), which has its outlet in the
Tower Hamlets, drains a portion of the City.</p>

<p>The reader must bear in mind, also, that were
he to traverse the Fleet sewer in the direction described&mdash;for
all the men I conversed with on the
subject, if asked to show the course of sewerage
with which they were familiar, began <i>from</i> the
outlet into the Thames&mdash;the reader, I say, must
remember that he would be advancing all the way
<i>against</i> the stream, in a direction in which he
would find the sewage flowing onward to its
mouth, while his course would be towards its
sources.</p>

<p>On the left-hand side (for the account before
given refers only to the right-hand side) proceeding
in the same direction, after passing the underground
precincts of the City proper, there is another
addition near Saffron-hill, of the sewage of 30
streets; then at Gray’s-inn-road is added the
sewage of 100 streets; New-road (at King’s-cross),
20 more streets; from the whole of Somers-town,
a populous locality, the sewerage concentrating
all the busy and crowded places round about “the
Brill,” &amp;c., the sewage of 120 streets is received;
and at Pratt-street, Camden-town, 12 other streets.</p>

<p>Thus into this sewage-current, directed to one
final outlet, are drained the refuse of 517 streets,
including, of course, a variety of minor thoroughfares,
courts, alleys, &amp;c., &amp;c., as in the neighbourhoods
of Gray’s-inn-road, in Clerkenwell, Somers-town,
&amp;c. Some of these tributaries to the efflux
of the sewage are “barrel-drains,” but perform the
function of sewers along small courts, where there
is “no thoroughfare” either <i>upon</i>, or <i>below</i> the
surface.</p>

<p>The London Bridge sewer runs up King William-street
to Moorgate-street, along Finsbury-square
into the City-road, diverging near the
Wharf-road, which it crosses <i>under</i> the canal
near the Wenlock basin, and thence along the
Lower-road, Islington, by Cock-lane, through
Highbury-vale; after this, at the extremity of
Holloway, the open ditches, as in the former
instance, carry on the conveyance of sewage from
the outer suburbs.</p>

<p>The King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer&mdash;which seems
to have given the Commissioners more trouble than
any other, in its connection with Buckingham
Palace, St. James’s Park, and the new Houses of
Parliament&mdash;runs from Chelsea-bridge past Cubitt’s
workshops, and along the King’s-road to Eaton-square,
the whole of which is drained into it;
then “turning round,” as one man described it, it
approaches Buckingham Palace, which, with its
grounds, as well as a portion of St. James’s and
the Green parks, is drained into this sewer;
then branching away for the reception of the
sewage from the houses and gardens of Chelsea,
it drains Sloane-street, and, crossing the Knightsbridge-road,
runs through or across Hyde-park to
the Swan at Bayswater, whence its course is by
the Westbourne District and under the canal, along
Paddington, until it attains the open country, or
rather the grounds, in that quarter, which have
been very extensively and are now still being
built over, and where new sewers are constructed
simultaneously with new streets.</p>

<p>Thus in the “reach,” as I heard it happily
enough designated, of each of these great sewers,
the reader will see from a map the extent of the
subterranean metropolis traversed, alike along
crowded streets ringing with the sounds of traffic,
among palatial and aristocratic domains, and along
the parks which adorn London, as well as winding
their ramifying course among the courts, alleys,
and teeming streets, the resorts of misery, poverty,
and vice.</p>

<p>Estimating, then, the number of sewers from the
number of their river outlets, and regarding all
the rest as the branches, or tributaries, to each of
these superior streams, we have, adopting the area
before specified as being drained by the metropolitan
sewers, viz., 58 square miles, the following
<span class="lock">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Each of the 60 sewers having an outlet into the
Thames drains 618 statute acres.</p>

<p>And assuming the number of houses included
within these 58 square miles to be 200,000, and
the population to amount to 1,500,000, or two-thirds
of the houses and people included in the
Registrar-General’s Metropolis, we may say that
each of the 60 sewers would carry into the Thames
the refuse from 25,000 individuals and 3333
inhabited houses. This, however, is partly prevented
by the cesspoolage system, which supplies
receptacles for a proportion of the refuse that,
were London to be rebuilt according to the provisions
of the present Building and Sanitary Acts,
would <i>all</i> be carried, without any interception,
into the river Thames by the media of the
sewers.</p>

<p>In my account of cesspoolage I shall endeavour
to show the extent of fæcal refuse, &amp;c., contained
in places not communicating with the sewers, and
to be removed by the labour of men and horses,
as well as the amount of fæcal refuse carried into
the sewerage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Qualities, etc., of the Sewage.</span></h3>

<p>The question of the value, the uses, and the best
means of collecting for use, the great mass of the
sewage of the metropolis, seems to have become
complicated by the statements which have been
of late years put forth by rival projectors and
rival companies. In our smaller country towns,
the neighbourhood of many being remarkable for
fertility and for a green beauty of meadow-land
and pasturage, the refuse of the towns, whether
sewage or cesspoolage (if not washed into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
current, stream, or river), is purchased by the
farmers, and carted by them to spread upon the
land.</p>

<p>By <i>sewage</i>, I mean the contents of the <i>sewerage</i>,
or of the series of sewers; which neither at present
nor, I believe, at any former period, has
been applied to any useful or profitable purpose
by the metropolitan authorities. The readiest
mode to get rid of it, without any care about
ultimate consequences, has always been resorted
to, and that mode has been to convey it into the
Thames, and leave the rest to the current of the
stream. But the Thames has its ebbs as well as
its flow, and the consequence is the sewage is
<i>never</i> got rid of.</p>

<p>The most eminent of our engineers have agreed
that it is a very important consideration how
this sewage should be not only innocuously but
profitably disposed of; and if not profitably, in
an immediate money return, to those who may be
considered its owners (the municipal authorities
of the kingdom), at least profitably in a national
point of view, by its use in the restoration or
enrichment of the fertility of the soil, and the
consequent increase of the food of man and beast.</p>

<p>Sir George Staunton has pronounced some of
the tea-growing parts of China to be as blooming
as an English nobleman’s flower-garden. Every
jot of manure, human ordure, and all else, is
minutely collected, even by the poorest.</p>

<p>I have already given a popular account of the
composition of the metropolitan sewage, &amp;c. (under
the head of Wet Refuse), and I now give its
scientific analysis.</p>

<p>In some districts the sewage is more or less liquid&mdash;in
what proportion has not been ascertained&mdash;and
I give, in the first place, an analysis of the
sewage of the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer, Westminster,
the result having been laid before a Committee
of the House of Commons. As the contents
of the great majority of sewers <i>must</i> be
the same, because resulting from the same natural
or universally domestic causes (as in the refuse
of cookery, washing, surface-water, &amp;c.), the analysis
of the sewage of the King’s Scholars’ Pond
Sewer may be accepted as one of sewer-matter
generally.</p>

<p>Evidence was given before the committee as to
the proportion of “land-drainage <i>water</i>” to what
was really <i>manure</i>, in the matter derived from the
sewer in question. A produce of 140 grains of
manure was derived from a gallon of sewer-water.
Messrs. Brande and Cooper, the analyzers, also
state that one gallon (10 lbs.?) of the liquid portion
of the sewage, evaporated to dryness, gave
85·3 grains of solid matter, 74·8 grains of which
was again soluble, and <span class="lock">contained&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p>“and potass and soda, with a large quantity of
soluble and vegetable matter, and 10·54 insoluble.”</p>

<p>This insoluble portion consisted of</p>

<tr><td class="left">Silica</td><td>6·28</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="total">10·54</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The deposit from another gallon weighed 55
grains, of which 21·22 were combustible, being
composed of animal matter “rich in nitrogen,”
some vegetable matter, and a quantity of fat. Of
this matter 33·75 grains consisted of</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="left">Earthy matter and sand</td><td>21·65</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="total">33·75</td></tr>

<p>Other Reports and other evidence show that
what is described as “earthy matter and sand”
is the mac, mud, and the mortar or concrete used in
pavement, washed from the surface of the streets
into the sewers by heavy rains; otherwise for the
most part the proper load of the scavager’s cart.</p>

<p>Further analyses might be adduced, but with
merely such variation in the result as is inevitable
from the state of the weather when the
sewage is drawn forth for examination; whether
the day on which this is done happens to be dry
or wet<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained, but the exact proportion
is not, and perhaps cannot be, given, that
the extent of covered to uncovered surface in the
district drained by the King’s Scholars’ Pond
Sewer was as 3 to 1, while that of the Ranelagh
Sewer, not far distant, was as 1 to 3, at the time
of the inquiry (1848).</p>

<p>“It could not be expected, therefore,” says
the Report, “that the Ranelagh Sewer (which,
moreover, is open to the admission of the tide at
its mouth), in the quantity or quality of the manure
produced, could bear any proportion to the
King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, of Deanston, stated in evidence,
that the average quantity of rain falling into
King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer was 139,934,586
cubic feet in a year, and he assumes 6,000,000
tons as the amount of average minimum quantity
of drainage (yearly), yielding 4 cwt. of solid matter
in each 100 tons = 1 in 500.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Granville said, on the same inquiry, that
he should be sorry to receive on his land 500 tons
of diluted sewer water (such as that from the uncovered
Ranelagh Sewer) for 1 ton of really fertilizing
sewage, such as that to be derived from
the King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer.</p>

<p>I could easily multiply these analyses, and give
further parliamentary or official statements, but,
as the results are the same, I will merely give
some extracts from the evidence of Dr. Arthur
Hassall, as to the microscopic constituents of
sewage-<span class="lock">water:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have examined,” he said, “the sewer-water
of several of the principal sewers of London. I
found in it, amongst many other things, much decomposing
vegetable matter, portions of the husks
and the hairs of the down of wheat, the cells of
the potato, cabbage, and other vegetables, while I
detected but few forms of animal life, those encountered
for the most part being a kind of worm
or anælid, and a certain species of animalcule of
the genus monas.”</p>

<p>“How do you account,” the Doctor was asked,
“for the comparative absence of animal life in the
water of most sewers?” “It is, doubtless, to be
attributed,” he replied, “in a great measure, to the
large quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen contained
in sewer-water, and which is continually being
evolved by the decomposing substances included
in it.”</p>

<p>“Have you any evidence to show that sewer-water
does contain sulphuretted hydrogen
in such large quantity as to be prejudicial and
even fatal to animal life?” “With a view of determining
this question, I made the following
experiments:&mdash;A given quantity of Thames
water, known to contain living infusoria, was
added to an equal quantity of sewer-water; examined
a few minutes afterwards, the animalculæ
were found to be either dead or deprived of locomotive
power and in a dying state. A small
fish, placed in a wine glass of sewer-water, immediately
gave signs of distress, and, after struggling
violently, floated on its side, and would have
perished in a few seconds, had it not been removed
and placed in fresh water. A bird placed
in a glass bell-jar, into which the gas evolved by
the sewer-water was allowed to pass, after struggling
a good deal, and showing other symptoms of
the action of the gas, suddenly fell on its side,
and, although immediately removed into fresh air,
was found to be dead. These experiments were
made, in the first instance, with the sewer water
of the Friar-street sewer (near the Blackfriars-road);
they were afterwards repeated with the
water of six other sewers on the Middlesex side,
and with the same result, as respects the animalculæ
and fish, but not the bird; this, although
evidently much affected by the noxious emanations
of the sewer-water, yet survived the experiment.”</p>

<p>“Would you infer from these experiments that
sewer-water, as contained in the Thames near to
London, is prejudicial to health?” “I would,
most decidedly; and regard the Thames in the
neighbourhood of the metropolis as nothing less
than diluted sewer-water.”</p>

<p>“You have just stated that you found sewer-water
to contain much vegetable matter, and but
few forms of animal life; the vegetable matter
you recognised, I presume, by the character of the
cells composing the several vegetable tissues?”
“Yes, as also by the action of iodine on the starch
of the vegetable matter.”</p>

<p>“In what way do you suppose these various
vegetable cells, the husks of wheat, &amp;c., reach the
sewers?” “They doubtless proceed from the
fæcal matter contained in sewage, and not in
general from the ordinary refuse of the kitchen,
which usually finds its way into the dust-bin.”</p>

<p>“Sewer-water, then, although containing but
few forms of animal life, yet contains, in large
quantities, the food upon which most animalculæ
feed?” “Yes; and it is this circumstance which
explains the vast abundance of infusorial life in
the water of the Thames within a few miles of
London.”</p>

<p>The same gentleman (a fellow of the Linnæan
Society, and the author of “A History of the
British Fresh-water Algæ,” or water-weeds considered
popularly), in answer to the following
inquiries in connection with this subject, also
<span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“What species of infusoria represent the <i>highest</i>
degree of impurity in water?” “The several
species of the genera <i>Oxytricha</i> and <i>Paramecium</i>.”</p>

<p>“What species is most abundant in the Thames
from Kew Bridge to Woolwich?” “The <i>Paramecium
Chrysalis</i> of Ehrenberg; this occurs in
all seasons of the year, and in all conditions of
the river, in vast and incalculable numbers; so
much so, that a quart bottle of Thames water, obtained
in any condition of the tide, is sure to be
found, on examination with the microscope, to
contain these creatures in great quantity.”</p>

<p>“Do you find that the infusorium of which you
have spoken varies in number in the different
parts of the river between Kew Bridge and
Woolwich?” “I find that it is most abundant
in the neighbourhood of the bridges.” [Where
the outlet of the sewers is common.]</p>

<p>“Then the order of impurity of Thames water,
in your view, would be the order in which it approaches
the centre of London?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>“You find then, in Thames water, about the
bridges, things decidedly connected with the
<i>sewer water</i>, as vegetable and animal matter in a
state of decomposition?” “I do; about the
bridges, and in the neighbourhood of London,
there is very little living vegetable matter on
which animalculæ could live; the only source of
supply which they have is <i>the organic matter contained
in sewer-water</i>, and which is to be regarded
as the food of these creatures. Where infusoria
abound, under circumstances <i>not</i> connected with
sewage, vegetable matter in a living condition is
certain to be met with.”</p>

<p>Respecting the <i>uses of the sewage</i>, I may add
the following brief observations. Without wishing
in any way to prejudice the question (indeed the
reader will bear in mind that I have all along
spoken reprovingly of the waste of sewage), I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
bound to say that the opinions I heard during
my inquiry from gentlemen scientifically and, in
some instances, practically familiar with the subject,
concurred in the conclusion that the <i>sewage</i>
of the metropolis cannot, with all the applications
of scientific skill and apparatus, be made either
sufficiently portable or efficacious for the purposes
of manure to assure a proper pecuniary return.
In this matter, perhaps, speculators have not
traced a sufficient distinction between the liquid
manure of the sewers and the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poudrette</i>,” or dry
manure, manufactured from the more solid excrementitious
matter of the cesspools, not only
in Paris, but, until lately, even in London, where
the business was chiefly in the hands of Frenchmen.
The staple of the French “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poudrette</i>” is
<i>not</i> “<i>sewage</i>,” that is, the outpourings of the
sewers&mdash;for this is carried into the Seine, and
washed away with little inconvenience, as the
tide hardly affects that river in Paris; but it
is altogether “<i>cesspoolage</i>,” that is, the deposit
of the cesspools, collected in fixed and moveable
utensils, regulated by the “universal” police of
Paris, and conveyed by Government labourers to
the Voirées, which are huge reservoirs of nightsoil
at Montfauçon, about five miles, and in the
Forest of Bondy, about ten miles, from the centre
of Paris. The London-made manure also was
all of cesspoolage; the contents of the nightman’s
cart being “shot” in the manufacturer’s yard;
and when so manufactured was, I believe, without
exception, sent to the sugar-growing colonies,
the farmers in the provinces pronouncing it “too
hot” for the ground. The same complaint, I may
observe, has been made of the French manufactured
cesspool manure. I heard, on the other
hand, opinions from scientific and practical gentlemen,
that the sewer-water of London was so
diluted, it was not profitably serviceable for the
irrigation of land. All, however, agreed that the
sewage of the metropolis ought not to be wasted,
as it was certain that perseverance in experiment
(and perhaps a large outlay) were certain to make
sewage of value.</p>

<p>The following results, which the Board of
Health have just issued in a Report, containing
“Minutes of Information attested on the Application
of Sewer-water and Town Manures to Agricultural
Production,” supply the latest information
on this subject. The Report says first, that “to
be told that the average yield of a county is 30
bushels of wheat per acre, or that the average
weight of the turnip crop is 15 tons per acre,
means very little, and there is little to be learned
from such intelligence; but if it is shown that a
certain farm under the usual mode of culture
yielded certain weights per acre, and that the
same land, by improved applications of the same
manure, by the use of machinery, and by <i>employing
double the number of hands, at increased
wages</i>, is made to yield <i>four fold</i> the weight of
crop and of <i>better quality</i> than was previously
obtained, a lesson is set before us worth
learning.”</p>

<p>It then proceeds to cite the following statements,
on the authority of the Hon. Dudley Fortescue,
as to the efficiency of sewage-water as a
liquid manure applied to land.</p>

<p>“The first farm we visited was that of Craigentinney,
situated about one mile and a half
south-east of Edinburgh, of which 260 Scotch
acres” (a Scotch acre is one-fourth more than any
English acre) “receive a considerable proportion
of such sewerage as, under an imperfect system
of house-drainage, is at present derived from half
the city. The meadows of which it chiefly consists
have been put under irrigation at various
times, the most recent addition being nearly 50
acres laid out in the course of last year and the
year previous, which, lying above the level of the
rest, are irrigated by means of a steam-engine.
The meadows first laid out are watered by contour
channels following the inequalities of the ground,
after the fashion commonly adopted in Devonshire;
but in the more recent parts the ground is
disposed in ‘panes’ of half an acre, served by
their respective feeders, a plan which, though
somewhat more expensive at the outset, is found
preferable in practice. The whole 260 acres
take about 44 days to irrigate; the men
charged with the duty of shifting the water
from one pane to another give to each plot
about two hours’ irrigation at a time; and the
engine serves its 50 acres in ten days, working
day and night, and employing one man at the
engine and another to shift the water. The produce
of the meadows is sold by auction on the
ground, ‘rouped,’ as it is termed, to the cow-feeders
of Edinburgh, the purchaser cutting and
carrying off all he can during the course of the
letting, which extends from about the middle of
April to October, when the meadows are shut up,
but the irrigation is continued through the winter.
The lettings average somewhat over 20<i>l.</i> the acre;
the highest last year having brought 31<i>l.</i>, and the
lowest 9<i>l.</i>; these last were of very limited extent,
on land recently denuded in laying out the
ground, and consequently much below its natural
level of productiveness. There are four cuttings
in the year, and the collective weight of grass cut
in parts was stated at the extraordinary amount
of 80 tons the imperial acre. The only cost of
maintaining these meadows, except those to which
the water is pumped by the engine, consists in
the employment of two hands to turn on and off
the water, and in the expense of clearing out the
channels, which was contracted for last year at
29<i>l.</i>, and the value of the refuse obtained was
considered fully equal to that sum, being applied
in manuring parts of the land for a crop of turnips,
which with only this dressing in addition to irrigation
with the sewage-water presented the most
luxuriant appearance. The crop, from present
indications, was estimated at from 30 to 40 tons
the acre, and was expected to realize 15<i>s.</i> the ton
sold on the land. From calculations made on the
spot we estimated the produce of the meadows
during the eight months of cutting at the keep of
ten cows per acre, exclusive of the distillery refuse
they consume in addition, at a cost of 1<i>s.</i> to
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per head per week. The sea-meadows
present a particularly striking example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
effects of the irrigation; these, comprising between
20 and 30 acres skirting the shores between
Leith and Musselburgh, were laid down in 1826
at a cost of about 700<i>l.</i>; the land consisted
formerly of a bare sandy tract, yielding almost
absolutely nothing; it is now covered with luxuriant
vegetation extending close down to high-water
mark, and lets at an average of 20<i>l.</i> per
acre at least. From the above statement it will
be seen how enormously profitable has been the
application in this case of town refuse in the
liquid form; and I have no hesitation in stating
that, great as its advantages have been, they
might be extended four or five fold by greater
dilution of the fluid. Four or five times the extent
of land might, I believe, be brought into
equally productive cultivation under an improved
system of drainage in the city, and a more abundant
use of water. Besides these Craigentinney
meadows, there are others on this and on the
west side of Edinburgh, which we did not visit,
similarly laid out, and I believe realizing still
larger profits, from their closer proximity to the
town, and their lying within the toll-gates.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, are said to be the results of a practical
application of sewer-water. The preliminary
remark of the Board of Health, however, applies
somewhat to the statement above given; for we
are not told what the <i>same land</i> produced before the
liquid manure was applied; nor are we informed
as to the peculiar condition and quantity of the
land near Craigentinney, and how it differs from
the land near London.</p>

<p>The other returns are of liquid manures, of
which sewer-water formed no part, and, therefore,
require no special notice of them. The following
observations are, however, worthy of <span class="lock">attention:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The cases above detailed furnish some measure
of the possible results attainable in cultivation,
especially corroborated as they are by others
which did not on this occasion come under our
personal observation, but one of which I may
mention, having recently examined into it, that of
Mr. Dickinson, at Willesden, who estimates his
yield of Italian rye-grass at from 80 to 100 tons
an acre, and gets 8 or 10 cuttings, according to
the season; and as there is no peculiar advantage
of soil or climate (the former ranging from almost
pure sands to cold and tenacious clays, and the
latter being inferior to that of a large proportion
of England) to prevent the same system being
almost universally adopted, they give some idea of
the degree to which the productiveness of land
may be raised by a judicious appliance of the
means within our reach. When it is considered
that such results may, in the vicinity of towns
and villages, be most effectually brought about by
the instant removal of all those matters which,
when allowed to remain in them, are among the
most fruitful sources of social degradation, disease,
and death, one cannot but earnestly desire the
furtherance of such measures as will ensure this
double result of purifying the town and enriching
the country; and as the facts I have stated came
at the same time under the notice of the gentleman
I mentioned above, under whose able superintendence
the arrangements for the water-supply
and drainage of several towns are now in course
of execution, I trust it will not be long before this
most advantageous mode of disposing of the refuse
of towns may be brought into practical operation
in various parts of the country.</p>

</p>

<p>“General Board of Health.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the New Plan of Sewerage.</span></h3>

<p>This branch of the subject hardly forms part of
my present inquiry, but, having pointed out the
defects of the sewers, it seems but reasonable and
right to say a few words on the measures determined
upon for their improvement. It is only
necessary for me, however, to indicate the principal
characteristics of the new, or rather intended,
mode of sewerage, as the work may be said to
have been but commenced, or hardly commenced
in earnest, the Report of Mr. Frank Forster (the
engineer) bearing the date of Jan. 30, 1851.</p>

<p>In the carrying out of the engineer’s plan&mdash;which
from its magnitude, and, in all human
probability, from its cost, when completed, would
be <i>national</i> in other countries, but is here only
<i>metropolitan</i>&mdash;in the carrying out of this scheme, I
say, two remarkable changes will be found. The
one is the employment of the power of steam in
sewerage; the other is the diversion of the sewage
from the current of the Thames. The ultimate
uses of this sewage, agriculturally or otherwise,
form no part of the present consideration.</p>

<p>I should, however, first enumerate the general
principles on which the best authorities have
agreed that the London sewers should be constructed
so as to ensure a proper disposal of the
sewage, for these principles are said to be at the
basis of Mr. Forster’s plan.</p>

<p>I condense under the following heads the substance
of a mass of Reports, Committee Meetings,
Suggestions, Plans, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The channels, or pipeage, or other means of
conveying away house-refuse, should be so made
that the removal will be <i>immediate</i>, more especially
of any refuse or filth capable of suspension in
water, since its immediate carrying off, it is said,
would leave no time for the generation of miasma.</p>

<p>2. Means should be provided for such disposal
of sewage as would prevent its tainting any
stream, well, or pool, or, by its stagnation or
obstruction, in any way poisoning the atmosphere.
And, as a natural and legitimate result, it should
be <i>so collected that it could be applied to the cultivation
of the land</i> at the most economical rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In the providing works of deposit or storage
in low districts, or “of discharge where the natural
outlets are free,” such works should be provided
as would not subject any place, or any man’s property,
to the risk of inundation, or any other evil
consequence; while in the construction of the
drainage of the substratum, the works should be
at such a depth below the foundation of all
buildings that tenements should not be exposed
to that continued damage from exhalation and
dampness which leads to the dry rot in timber,
and to an immature decay of materials and a
general unhealthiness.</p>

<p>There are other points insisted upon in many
Reports to which I need but allude, such as</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The channels containing sewage should be
of enduring and impermeable material, so as to
prevent all soakage.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) There should be throughout the channels of
the subterranean metropolis a fall or inclination
which would suffice to prevent the accumulation
of any sewage deposit, with its deleterious influence
and ultimate costliness.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Similar provisions should be used were it
but to prevent the creation of the noxious gases
which now permeate many houses (especially in
the quarters inhabited by the poor) and escape
into many streets, courts, and alleys, for until
improvements are effected the pent-up sewage and
the saturated brickwork of the sewers and older
drains must generate such gases.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) No tidal stream should ever receive a
flow of sewage, because then the cause of evil is
never absent, for the filth comes back with the
tide; and as the Thames water constitutes the
grand fount of metropolitan consumption, the
water companies, with very trifling exceptions,
give us back much of our own excrement, mixed
with every conceivable, and sometimes noxious,
nastiness, with which we may brew, cook, and
wash&mdash;and drink, if we can. Filtering remedies
but a portion of the evil.</p>

<p>Now it would appear that not one of these
requirements, the necessity of which is unquestioned
and unquestionable, is fully carried out by
the present system of sewerage, and hence the
need of some new plan in which the defects may
be remedied, and the proper principles carried out.</p>

<p>The instructions given by the Court were to
the following <span class="lock">effect:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. The Thames should be kept free from sewage
whatever the state of the tide.</p>

<p>B. There should be intercepting drains to carry
off the sewage (so keeping the Thames unsoiled
by it) wherever practicable.</p>

<p>C. The sewage should be raised by artificial
means into a main channel for removal.</p>

<p>D. The intercepting sewers should be so constructed
as to secure the largest amount of effective
drainage without artificial appliances.</p>

<p>In preparing his plan, Mr. Forster had the advice
and assistance of Mr. Haywood, of the City
Court of Sewers.</p>

<p>The metropolis is divided into two portions&mdash;“the
northern portion of the metropolis,” or
rather that portion of the metropolis which is on
the north or Middlesex bank of the Thames; and
the southern portion, or that which is on the south
or Surrey side of the river.</p>

<p>The northern portion is in the new plan considered
to “divide itself into two separate areas,”
and to these two areas different modes of sewerage
are to be applied:</p>

<p>“1. The interception of the drainage of that
district, which, from its elevation above the level
of the outlet, is capable of having its sewage and
rainfall carried off by gravitation.</p>

<p>“2. The interception of the drainage of that
district, which, from its low lying position, will
require its sewage, and in most localities its rainfall,
to be lifted by steam-power to a proper level
for discharge.”</p>

<p>The first district runs from Holsden-green (beyond
the better-known Kensall-green) in the
west, to the Tower Hamlets in the east. Its form
is irregular, but not very much so, merely narrowing
from Westbourn-green to its western extremity,
the country then becoming rural or woodland.
Its highest reaches to the north are to
Highgate and Stamford-hill. The nearest approach
to the south is to a portion of the Strand,
between Charing-cross and Drury-lane. Care has
evidently been taken to skirt this district, so to
speak, by the canals and the railroads. This division
of the northern portion is described as
“the district for natural drainage.”</p>

<p>The area of this division is about 25⅙ square
miles.</p>

<p>The second division meets the first at the highway
separating Kensington-gardens from Bayswater;
and runs on, bordering the river, all the
way to the West India Dock. Its shape is irregular,
but, abating the roundness, presents somewhat
of that sort of figure seen in the instrument
known as a dumb-bell, the narrowest or hand-part
being that between Charing-cross and Drury-lane,
skirting the river as its southern bound. At
its eastern end this second district widens abruptly,
taking in Victoria-park, Stratford, and
Bromley.</p>

<p>The area of this division of the northern portion
is 16⅛ square miles.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, two small tracts, comprising
the southern part of the Isle of Dogs, and
a narrow slip on the west side of the river Lea,
which are intended to allow the rainfall to run
into the Thames and the Lea respectively.</p>

<p>The area of the two is 1&frac34; square mile.</p>

<p>The area to be drained by natural outfall comprises,
then, 25⅙ square miles as regards rainfall,
and the same extent as regards sewage; while the
area to the drainage of which steam power is to
be applied comprises 14⅓ square miles of rainfall,
and 16⅙ square miles of sewage; the two united
areas of rainfall and sewage respectively being
39&frac12; and 41⅓ square miles.</p>

<p>The length of the great “high-level sewerage”
will be, as regards the main sewer, 19 miles and
106 yards; that of the “low-level sewerage,” 14
miles and 1501 yards.</p>

<p>I will now describe the course of each of these
constructions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>On the eastern bank of the Lea the sewage of
both districts is to be concentrated. The high-level
sewer will commence and <i>cross</i> the Lea near
the “Four Mills.” It is then to proceed “in a
westerly direction under the East and West India
Dock Railway and the Blackwall Extension Railway,
beneath the Regent’s-canal, to the east end
of the Bethnal-green-road, at the crossing of the
Cambridge-heath-road, at which point it will be
joined by the proposed northern division of the
Hackney-brook, which drains an extensive district
up to the watershed line north of London,
including Hackney, Stoke Newington and Holloway,
and part of Highgate and Hampstead; from
thence the main sewer proceeds along the Bethnal-green-road,
Church-street, Old-street, Wilderness-row
(where a short branch from Coppice-row will
join) to Brook-street-hill; from thence to Little
Saffron-hill, where a distance of about 100 yards
is proposed to be carried by an aqueduct over the
Fleet-valley; thence along Liquorpond-street, at
the end of which it will receive a branch from
Piccadilly, on the south side, and a diversion of
the Fleet-river, on the north side; thence along
Theobald’s-road, Bloomsbury-square, Hart-street,
New Oxford-street, to Rathbone-place (where it
will receive a diversion of the Regent-street sewer
from Park-crescent), along Oxford-street, and extending
thence across Regent-circus to South
Molton-lane (where it will intercept the King’s
Scholars’ Pond sewer), continuing still along Oxford-street
to Bayswater-place, Grand Junction-road,
Uxbridge-road, where it is joined by the
Ranelagh sewer, the sewage of which it is capable
of receiving, and at this point it terminates.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to convey to a reader, especially
to a reader who may not be familiar with the
localities of London generally, any adequate notion
of the largeness, speaking merely of extent,
of this undertaking. Even a map conveys no
sufficient idea of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may best be able to suggest to a
reader’s mind a knowledge of this largeness, when
I state that in the district I have just described,
which is but <i>one</i> portion (although the greatest) of
the sewerage of but <i>one</i> side of the Thames,
more than half a million of persons, and nearly
100,000 houses are, so to speak, to be sewered.</p>

<p>The low-level tract sewerage, also, concentrates
on the Lea, “near to Four Mill’s distillery, taking
the north-western bank of the Limehouse Cut, at
which point it receives the branch intended to intercept
the sewage of the Isle of Dogs; thence
continuing along the bank of Limehouse Cut,
through a portion of the Commercial-road, Brook-street,
and beneath the Sun Tavern Fields, into
High-street, or Upper Shadwell; thence along
Ratcliffe-highway and Upper East Smithfield,
across Tower-hill, through Little and Great Tower-streets,
Eastcheap, Cannon-street, Little and Great
St. Thomas Apostle, Trinity-lane, Old Fish-street,
and Little Knight Rider-street; thence
beneath houses in Wardrobe-terrace, and on the
eastern side of St. Andrew’s-hill, along Earl-street
to Blackfriars-road. From Blackfriars
Bridge it is proposed to construct the sewer along
the river shore to the junction of the Victoria-street
sewer at Percy-wharf; which sewer between
Percy-wharf and Shaftesbury-terrace, Pimlico,
becomes thus an integral portion of the intercepting
line; at Bridge-street, Westminster, a
branch from the Victoria-street sewer is intended
to proceed along Abingdon and Millbank-streets,
as far as and for the purpose of taking up the
King’s Scholars’ Pond and other sewers at their
outlets into the Thames. From Shaftesbury-terrace
the Victoria-street sewer is proposed to be
extended through Eaton-square and along the
King’s-road, Chelsea, to Park-walk, intercepting
all the sewers along its line, and terminating at a
point where the drainage of Kensington may be
brought into it without pumping.”</p>

<p>The lines of sewerage thus described are, then,
all to the <i>west</i> of the Lea, and all, whether from
the shore of the Thames, or the northern reaches
in Highgate and Hampstead, converging to a
pumping station or sewage-concentration, on the
<i>east</i> bank of the Lea, in West Ham. By this
new plan, then, the high-level sewer is to <i>cross</i>
the Lea, but that arrangement is impossible as
respects the second district described, which is
<i>below</i> the level of the Lea, so that its course is to
be <i>beneath</i> that river, a little below where it is
crossed by the high-level line. To dispose of the
sewage, therefore, conveyed from the low-level
tract, there will be a sewer of a “depth of <i>forty-seven</i>
feet <i>below</i>” the invert of the high-level
sewer. This sewer, then, at the depth of 47 feet,
will run to the point of concentration containing
the low-level sewage.</p>

<p>At this point of the works, in order that the
sewage may be collected, so as to be disposed
of ultimately in one mass, it has to be <i>lifted</i> from
the low to the high-level sewer. The invert of
the high-level sewer will at the lifting or pumping
station be 20 feet <i>above</i> the ordnance datum,
while that of the low-level sewer will be 27 feet
<i>below</i> the same standard. Thus a great body of metropolitan
sewage, comprising among other districts
the refuse of the whole City of London, must be
lifted no less than 47 feet, in order to be got rid
of along with what has been carried to the same
focus by its natural flow.</p>

<p>The lifting is to be effected by means of steam,
and the pumping power required has been computed
at 1100-horse power. To supply this great
mechanical and scientific force, there are to be provided
two engines, each of 550-horse power, with
a third engine of equal capacity, to be available
in case of accident, or while either of the other
engines might require repairs of some duration.</p>

<p>The northern sewage of London (or that of the
Middlesex bank of the Thames, covered by that
division of the capital) having been thus brought
to a sort of central reservoir, or meeting point,
will be conveyed in two parallel lines of sewerage
to the bank of the river Roding, being the eastern
extremity of Gallion’s Reach (which is below
Woolwich Reach), in the Thames. The Roding
flows into the Thames at Barking Creek mouth.
The length of this line will be four miles.</p>

<p>“At this point,” it is stated in the Report,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
“the level of the inverts of the parallel sewers
will be eight feet below high-water mark, and
here it is intended to collect the sewage into a
reservoir during the flood-tide, and discharge the
same with the ebb-tide immediately after high-water;
and, as it is estimated that the reservoir
will be completely emptied during the first three
hours of the ebb, it may be safely anticipated that
no portion of the sewage will be returned, with
the flood-tide, to within the bounds of the metropolis.”</p>

<p>The whole of the sewage and rainfall, then,
will be thus diverted to <i>one</i> destination, instead of
being issued into the river through a multiplicity
of outlets in every part of the northern shore
where the population is dense, and will be carried
into the Thames at Barking Creek, unless, as I
have intimated, a market be found for the sewage;
when it may be disposed of as is most advantageous.
The only exceptions to this carrying off will be
upon the occurrence of long-continued and heavy
rains or violent storms, when the surplus water
will be carried off by some of the present outlets
into the river; but even on such occasions, the <i>first
scour</i> or cleansings of the sewerage will be conveyed
to the main outlet at the river Roding.</p>

<p>The inclination which has been assigned to the
whole of the lines of sewers I have described, is,
with some unimportant exceptions, 4 feet per mile,
or 1 in 1320. These new sewers are, or rather will
be, calculated to carry off a fall of rain, equal to
&frac14; inch in 24 hours, in addition to the average daily
flow of sewage.</p>

<p>Mr. Forster concludes his Report:&mdash;“I am only
able to submit approximately that I estimate the
cost of the whole of the lines of sewers, the
pumping engines, and station, the reservoir, tidal
gates, and other apparatus, at one million and
eighty thousand pounds (1,080,000<i>l.</i>). This estimate
does not include the sums required for the
purchase of land and houses, which may be needed
for the site of the pumping engine-house, or compensation
for certain portions of the lines of
sewers.”</p>

<p>As regards the improvements in the sewerage
on the south side of the Thames (the great fever
district of the metropolis, and consequently the
most important of all, and where the drainage is
of the worst kind), I can be very brief, as nothing
has been positively determined.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar system will be adopted on
the south side of the Thames, where it is proposed
to form one main intercepting sewer; but,
owing to the physical configuration of this part of
the town, none of the water will flow away entirely
by gravitation. There will be a pumping
station on the banks of the Ravensbourne, to
raise the water about 25 feet; and a second
pumping station to raise the water from the continued
sewer in the reservoir, in Woolwich Marsh,
which is to receive it during the intervals of the
tides. The waters are to be discharged into the
river at the last-named point. The main sewer
on the south side will be of nearly equally colossal
proportions; for its total length is proposed to be
about 13 miles 3 furlongs, including the main
trunk drain of about 2 miles long, and the respective
branches. The area to be relieved is
about proportionate to the length of the drain;
but the steam power employed will be proportionally
greater upon the southern than upon the
northern side.</p>

<p>There are divers opinions, of course, as to the
practicability and ultimate good working of this
plan; speculations into which it is not necessary
for me to enter. Mr. Forster has, moreover, resigned
his office, adding another to the many
changes among the engineers, surveyors, and other
employés under the Metropolitan Commission; a
fact little creditable to the management of the
Commissioners, who, with one exception, may be
looked upon as irresponsible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Management of the Sewers and
the late Commissions.</span></h3>

<p>The Corporation of the City of London may be
regarded as the first Commission of Sewers in the
exercise of authority over such places as regards
the removal of the filth of towns. In time, but
at what time there is no account, the business was
consigned to the management of a committee, as
are now the markets of the City (Markets Committee),
and even what may be called the management
of the Thames (Navigation Committee). It
is not at all necessary that the members of these
committees should understand anything about the
matters upon which they have to determine. A
staff of officers, clerks, secretaries, solicitors, and surveyors,
save the members the trouble of thought or
inquiry; they have merely to vote and determine.
It was stated in evidence before a Select Committee
of the House of Commons on the subject of the
Thames steamers, that at that period the Chairman
of the <i>Navigation</i> Committee was a bread
and biscuit baker, but “a very-firm-minded man.”
In time, but again I can find no note of the precise
date, the <i>Committee</i> became a <i>Court</i> of Sewers,
and so it remains to the present time. Commissions
of sewers have been issued by the Crown
since the 25th year of the reign of Henry VIII.,
except during the era of the Commonwealth, when
there seems to have been no attention paid to the
matter.</p>

<p>As the metropolis increased rapidly in size since
the close of the last century, the public sewers of
course increased in proportion, and so did Commissions
of Sewers in the newly-built districts. Up
to 1847 these Commissions or Court of Sewers
were <i>eight</i> in number, the metropolis being divided
into that number of districts.</p>

<p>The districts were as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. The City.</li>
<li>2. The Tower Hamlets.</li>
<li>3. St. Katherine.</li>
<li>4. Poplar and Blackwall.</li>
<li>5. Holborn and Finsbury.</li>
<li>6. Westminster and part of Middlesex.</li>
<li>7. Surrey and Kent.</li>
<li>8. Greenwich.</li>

</ul>

<p>Each of these eight Commissions had its own
Act of Parliament; its own distinct, often irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and generally uncontrolled plan of management;
each had its own officers; and each had its own
patronage. Each district court&mdash;with almost unlimited
powers of taxation&mdash;pursued its own plans
of sewerage, little regardful of the plans of its
neighbour Commission. This wretched system&mdash;the
great recommendation of which, to its promoters
and supporters, seems to have been patronage&mdash;has
given us a sewerage unconnected and varying
to the present day in almost every district;
varying in the dimensions, form, and inclination
of the structures.</p>

<p>The eight commission districts, I may observe,
had each their sub-districts, though the general
control was in the hands of the particular Court
or Board of Commissioners for the entire locality.
These subdivisions were chiefly for the facilities of
rate-collecting, and were usually “western,” “eastern,”
and “central.”</p>

<p>The consequence of this immethodical system
has been that, until the surveys and works now in
progress are completed, the precise character, and
even the precise length, of the sewers must be
unknown, though a sufficient approximation may
be deduced in the interim.</p>

<p>To show the conflicting character of the sewerage,
I may here observe that in some of the old
sewers have been found walls and arches crumbling
to pieces. Some old sewers were found to be not
only of ample proportions, but to contain subterranean
chambers, not to say halls, filled with filth,
into which no man could venture. While in a
sewer in the newly-built district of St. John’s-wood,
Mr. Morton, the Clerk of Works, could
only advance stooping half double, could not turn
round when he had completed his examination,
but had most painfully&mdash;for a long time feeling the
effects&mdash;to back out along the sewer, stooping, or
doubled up, as he entered it. Why the sewer
was constructed in this manner is not stated, but
the work appears, inferentially, to have been
<i>scamped</i>, which, had there been a proper supervision,
could hardly have been done with a modern
public sewer, down a thoroughfare of some length
(the Woronzow-road).</p>

<p>But the conflicting and disjointed system of
sewerage was not the sole evil of the various Commissions.
The mismanagement and jobbery, not to
say peculation, of the public moneys, appear to have
been enormous. For instance, in the “Accountant’s
Report” (February, 1848), prepared by Mr.
W. H. Grey, 48, Lincoln’s-inn-fields, I find the
following statements relative to the <i>Book-keeping</i>
of the several <span class="lock">Commissions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The <i>Westminster</i> plan is full of unnecessary
repetition. It is deficient in those real general
accounts which concentrate the information most
needed by the Commissioners, and it contains
<i>fictions</i> which are very inconsistent with any
sound system of book-keeping.</p>

<p>“The ledger of the Westminster Commission
does not give a true account of the actual receipt
and expenditure of each district.</p>

<p>“The <i>Holborn and Finsbury</i> books are still
more defective than those of the Westminster
Commission.... There are the same kind of
<i>fictions</i>.... But the extraordinary defect in
these books consists in the utter want of system
throughout them, by keeping one-sided accounts
only in the ledger, with respect to the different
sewers in each district, showing only the amount
<i>expended</i> on each.</p>

<p>“The <i>Tower Hamlets</i> books have been kept on
a regular system, though by no means one conveying
much general information.”</p>

<p>“With respect to the <i>Surrey and Kent</i> accounts,”
says Mr. Grey, “the books produced are
the most incomplete and unsatisfactory that ever
came under my observation. The ledger is always
thought to be a <i>sine quâ non</i> in book-keeping;
but here it has been dispensed with altogether,
for that which is so marked is no ledger at all.”</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the Report continues,
“It cannot be wondered at that debts
should have been incurred, or that they should
have swollen to the amount of 54,000<i>l.</i>, carrying
a yearly interest of 2360<i>l.</i>, besides annuities
granted to the amount of 1125<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p>“The <i>Poplar and Greenwich</i> accounts (I quote
the official Report), confined as they are to mere
cash books, offer no subjects for remark....</p>

<p>“No books of account have been produced with
respect to the <i>St. Katherine’s</i> Commission.”</p>

<p>On the 16th December, 1847, the new Commissioners
ordered all the books to be sent to the
office in Greek-street; but it was not until the
21st February, 1848, that all the minute-books
were produced. There were no indexes for many
years even to the proceedings of the Courts; and
the account-books of one of the local Courts, if
they might be so called, were in such a state that
the book called “ledger” had for several years
been cast up in pencil only.</p>

<p>This refers to what may be characterised, with
more or less propriety, as <i>mismanagement</i> or <i>neglect</i>;
though in such mismanagement it is hardly
possible to escape <i>one</i> inference. I now come to
what are direct imputations of <i>Jobbery</i>, and
where <i>that</i> is flourishing or easy, no system can
be other than vicious.</p>

<p>In a paper “printed for use of Commissioners”
(Sept. 7, 1848), entitled “Draft Report on the
Surrey Accounts,” emanating from a “General
Purposes’ Committee,” I find the following, concerning
the parliamentary expenses of obtaining
an Act which it was “found necessary to repeal.”
The cost was, altogether, upwards of 1800<i>l.</i>, which
of course had to be defrayed out of the taxes.</p>

<p>“This Act,” says the Report, “authorized an
almost unlimited borrowing of money; and <i>immediately
upon its passing</i>, in July, 1847, notices were
issued for works estimated to amount to 100,000<i>l.</i>;
and others, we understand, were projected for
early execution to the amount of 300,000<i>l.</i>...
Considering the general character of the works
executed, and from them judging of those projected,
it may confidently be averred that the
<i>whole sum</i> of 300,000<i>l.</i>, the progressive expenditure
of which was stayed by the ‘supersedeas’ of
the old Commission, would have been <i>expended
in waste</i>.” [The <i>Italics</i> are not those of the Reports.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>The Report continues, “It is to be observed
that each of the district surveyors would have
participated in the sum of 15,000<i>l.</i> percentage
on the expenditure for the extension of the Surrey
works. Thus the surveyors, with their percentages
on the works executed, and the clerk, by
the fees on contracts, &amp;c., had <i>a direct interest
in a large expenditure</i>.”</p>

<p>Instances of the same dishonest kind might be
multiplied to almost any extent.</p>

<p>After the above evidences of the incompetency
and dishonesty of the several district Commissions&mdash;and
the Reports from which they are copied
contain many more examples of a similar and
even worse description&mdash;it is not to be wondered at
that in the year 1847 the district courts were,
with the exception of the City, superseded by the
authority of the Crown, and formed into one
body, the present Metropolitan Commission of
Sewers, of the constitution and powers of which I
shall now proceed to speak.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Powers and Authority of the
present Commissions of Sewers</span>.</h3>

<p>In 1847 the eight separate Commissions of Sewers
were abolished, and the whole condensed, by the
Government, into <i>one</i> Commission, with the exception
of the City, which seems to supply an exception
in most public matters.</p>

<p>The Act does not fix the number of the Commissioners.
To the Metropolitan Commissioners,
five City Commissioners are added (the Lord
Mayor for the year being one <i>ex officio</i>); these
have a right to act as members of the Metropolitan
Board, but their powers in this capacity
are loosely defined by the Act, and they rarely
attend, or perhaps never attend, unless the business
in some way or other affects their distinct
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Commissioners (of whom twelve form a
quorum) are unpaid, with the exception of the
chairman, Mr. E. Lawes, a barrister, who has 1000<i>l.</i>
a year. They are appointed for the term of two
years, revocable at pleasure.</p>

<p>The authority of the City Commission, as distinct
from the Metropolitan, for there are two
separate Acts, seems to be more strongly defined
than that of the others, but the principle is the
same throughout. The Metropolitan Act bears
date September 4, 1848; and the City Act, September
5, 1848.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Commissioners have the control
over “the sewers, drains, watercourses, weirs,
dams, banks, defences, gratings, pipes, conduits,
culverts, sinks, vaults, cesspools, rivers, reservoirs,
engines, sluices, penstocks, and other works and
apparatus for the collection and discharge of rain-water,
surplus land or spring-water, waste water,
or filth, or fluid, or semi-fluid refuse of all descriptions,
and for the protection of land from floods
or inundation within the limits of the Commission.”
Ample as these powers seem to be, the
Commissioners’ authority does not extend over the
Thames, which is in the jurisdiction of the Lord
Mayor and Corporation of the City of London;
and it appears childish to give men control over
“rivers,” and to empower them to take measures
“for the protection of land from floods or inundation,”
while over the great metropolitan stream
itself, from Yantlet Creek, below Gravesend, to
Oxford, they have no power whatever.</p>

<p>The Commissioners (City as well as Metropolitan)
are empowered to enforce proper house-drainage
wherever needed; to regulate the building of
new houses, in respect of water-closets, cesspools,
&amp;c.; to order any street, staircase, or passage not
effectually cleansed to be effectually cleansed; to
remedy all nuisances having insanitary tendencies;
to erect <i>public</i> water-closets and urinals, free from
any charge to the public; to order houses and
rooms to be whitewashed; to erect places for depositing
the bodies of poor persons deceased until
interment; and to regulate the cleanliness, ventilation,
and even accommodation of low lodging-houses.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commissioners
of Sewers extends over “all such places
or parts in the counties of Middlesex, Surrey,
Essex, and Kent, or any of them <i>not more than
twelve miles distant in a straight line from St.
Paul’s Cathedral, in the City of London</i>, but not
being within the City of London or the liberties
thereof.”</p>

<p>This, it must be confessed, is an exceedingly
broad definition of the extent of the jurisdiction of
the <i>Metropolitan</i> Commission, giving the Commissioners
an extraordinary amount of <i>latitude</i>.</p>

<p>In our days there are many Londons. There
is the London (or the metropolitan apportionment
of the capital) as defined by the Registrar-General.
This, as we have seen, has an area of 115
square miles, and therefore may be said to comprise
as nearly as possible all those places which
are rather more than <i>five miles</i> distant from the
Post Office.</p>

<p>There is the <i>Metropolis</i> as defined by the Post-Office
functionaries, or the limits assigned to
what is termed the “<i>London</i> District Post.” This
London District Post seems, however, to have
three different metropolises:&mdash;First, there is the
Central Metropolis, throughout which there is
an hourly delivery of letters after mid-day, and
which deliveries are said to be confined to
“<i>London.</i>” Then there is the six-delivery <i>Metropolis</i>,
or that throughout which the letters are despatched
and received six times per day; this is said
to extend to such of the “environs” as are included
within a circle of <i>three miles</i> from the General
Post Office. Then there is the <i>six-mile Metropolis</i>
with special privileges. And lastly, the <i>twelve-mile
Metropolis</i>, which, being the extreme range of the
<i>London</i> District Post, may be said to constitute
the metropolis of the General Post Office.</p>

<p>There is, again, the metropolis of the Metropolitan
Commissioners of Police, before the region
of rural police and country and parish constables
is attained; a jurisdiction which covers 96 square
miles, as I have shown at pp. <a href="#Page_163">163-166</a> of the present
volume, and reaches&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;to such
places as are included within a circle of <i>five miles
and a half</i> from the General Post Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, moreover, the metropolis, as defined
by the Hackney-Carriage Act, which comprises all
such places as are within <i>five miles</i> of the General
Post Office.</p>

<p>And further, there is the Metropolis of the
London City Mission, which extends to <i>eight miles</i>
from the Post Office, and the Metropolis, again, of
the London Ragged Schools, which reaches to
about <i>three miles</i> from the Post Office.</p>

<p>This, however, is not all, for there are divers
districts for the registration and exercise of votes,
parliamentary, or municipal; there are ecclesiastical
and educational districts; there is a thorough
complication of parochial, extra-parochial, and chartered
districts; there is a world of subdivisions
and of sub-subdivisions, so ramified here and so
closely blended there, and often with such preposterous
and arbitrary distinctions, that to describe
them would occupy more than a whole Number.</p>

<p>My present business, however, is the extent of
the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commissioners
of Sewers, or rather to ascertain the boundaries of
that <i>metropolis</i> over which the Metropolitan Commissioners
are allowed to have sway.</p>

<p>The many discrepancies and differences I have
explained make it difficult to <i>define</i> any district
for the London sewerage; and in the Reports, &amp;c.,
which are presented to Parliament, or prepared by
public bodies, little or no care seems to be taken
to observe any distinctiveness in this respect.</p>

<p>For instance: The jurisdiction of the Metropolitan
Commission of Sewers, which is said to extend
to all such places as are not more than 12 miles
distant in a straight line from St. Paul’s Cathedral,
in the City of London, comprises an area of 452
square miles; the metropolis, that of the Registrar-General,
presenting a radius of 6 miles (with a
fractional addition), contains 115 square miles;
yet in official documents 58 square miles, or a
circle of about 4&frac12; miles radius, are given as the
extent of the <i>metropolis</i> sewered by the Metropolitan
Commission. By what calculations this 58
miles are arrived at, whether it has been the <i>arbitrium</i>
of the authorities to consider the sewers,
&amp;c., as occupying <i>the half</i> of the area of the Registrar-General’s
metropolis, or what other reason has
induced the computation, I am unable to say.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the several metropolises may
be indicated as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>Three-Mile Circle</i> includes Camberwell;
skirts Peckham; seems to divide Deptford (irregularly);
touches the West India Dock; includes
portions of Limehouse, Stepney, Bromley, Stratford-le-Bow,
and about the half of Victoria-park,
Hackney. It likewise comprises a part of Lower
Clapton, Dalston, and a portion of Stoke Newington;
and closely touching upon or containing
small portions of Lower Holloway, and Kentish-town,
sweeps through the Regent’s and Hyde
parks, includes a moiety of Chelsea, and crossing
the river at the Red-house, Battersea, completes
the circle. This is the six-delivery district of the
General Post Office.</p>

<p>In this three-mile district are chiefly condensed
the population, commerce, and wealth of the
greatest and richest city in the world.</p>

<p>The <i>Six-Mile Circle</i> runs from Streatham (on
the south); just excludes Sydenham; contains
within its exterior line Lewisham, Greenwich,
and a part of Woolwich; also, wholly or partially,
East Ham, Laytonstone, Walthamstow, Tottenham,
Hornsey, Highgate, Hampstead, Kensall-green,
Hammersmith, Fulham, Wandsworth, and
Upper Tooting. The portion without the three-mile
circle, and within the six, is the <i>suburban</i>
portion or the immediate environs of the metropolis,
and still presents rural and woodland beauties
in different localities. This may be termed the
metropolis of the Registrar-General and Commissioners
of Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p>The <i>Twelve-Mile Circle</i>, or the extent of the
jurisdiction of the <i>Metropolitan</i> Commissioners of
Sewers, as well as the “<i>London</i> District Post,” includes
Croydon, Wickham, Paul’s Cray, Foot’s Cray,
North Cray, and Bexley; crosses the river at the
Erith-reach; proceeds across the Rainham-marshes;
comprises Dagenham; skirts Romford; includes
Henhault-forest and the greater portion of Epping-forest;
touches Waltham-abbey and Cheshunt;
comprehends Enfield and Chipping-Barnet; runs
through Elstre and Stanmore; comprehends Harrow-on-the-Hill,
Norwood, and Hounslow; embraces
Twickenham and Teddington; seems to
divide somewhat equally the domains of Bushey-park
and of Hampton-court Palace; then, crossing
the river about midway between Thames Ditton
and Kingston, the boundary line passes between
Cheam and Ewell, and completes the circuit.</p>

<p>Over this large district, then, the jurisdiction
of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers is
said to extend, and one of the outlets of the
<i>London</i> sewers has already been spoken of as being
situate at Hampton. The district yielding the
amount of sewage which is assumed as being the
gross wet house-refuse of the metropolis is, as we
have seen, taken at 58 square miles, and is comprised
within a circle of about 4&frac12; miles radius; this
reaches only to Brixton, Dulwich, Greenwich,
East India Docks, Layton, Highgate, Hampstead,
Bayswater, Kensington, Brompton, and Battersea.
The actual jurisdiction of the Commissioners is,
then, nearly eight times larger than the portion to
which the estimated amount of the sewage of
the metropolis refers.</p>

<p>The metropolitan district is still distinguished
by the old divisions of the Tower Hamlets,
Poplar and Blackwall, Holborn and Finsbury,
Westminster, &amp;c.; but many of these divisions are
now incorporated into one district; of which there
would appear to be but four at present; or five,
inclusive of the City.</p>

<p>These are as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Fulham and Hammersmith, Counter’s Creek
and Ranelagh districts.</p>

<p>2. Westminster (Eastern and Western), Regent-street,
and Holborn.</p>

<p>3. Finsbury, Tower Hamlets, Poplar, and
Blackwall.</p>

<p>4. Districts south of the Thames, Eastern and
Western.</p>

<p>5. City.</p>

<p>The practical part or working of the Commis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>sion
of Sewers is much less complicated at present
than it was in the times of the independent
districts and independent commissions.</p>

<p>The orders for all work to be done emanate
from the court in Greek-street, but the several
surveyors, &amp;c. (whose salaries, numbers, &amp;c., are
given below), can and do order on their responsibility
any repair of a temporary character which is
evidently pressing, and report it at the next court
day. The Court meets weekly and monthly, and
what may be styled the heavier portion of the business,
as regards expenditure on great works, is more
usually transacted at the monthly meetings, when
the attendance is generally fuller; but the Court
can, and sometimes does, meet much more frequently,
and sometimes has adjourned from day
to day.</p>

<p>Any private individual or any public body
may make a communication or suggestion to the
Court of Sewers, which, if it be in accordance
with their functions, is taken into consideration
at the next accruing court day, or as soon after as
convenient. The Court in these cases either
comes to a decision of adoption or rejection of any
proposition, or refers it to one of their engineers
or surveyors for a report, or to a committee of the
Commissioners, appointed by the Court; if the
proposition be professional, as to defects, or alleged
and recommended improvements in the local
sewers, &amp;c., it is referred to a professional gentleman
for his opinion; if it be more general, as to
the extension of sewerage to some new undertaking
or meditated undertaking in the way of
building new markets, streets, or any places, large
and public; or in applications for the use and
appropriation by enterprising men of sewage
manure, it is referred to a committee.</p>

<p>On receiving such reports the Court makes an
order according to its discretion. If the work to
be done be extensive, it is entrusted to the chief
engineer, and perhaps to a principal surveyor
acting in accordance with him; if the work be
more local, it is consigned to a surveyor. One or
other of these officers provides, or causes to be
prepared, a plan and a description of the work
to be done, and instructs the clerk of the
works to procure estimates of the cost at which
a contractor will undertake to execute this
work, or, as it is often called by the labouring
class, to “complete the <i>job</i>” (a word at one
time singularly applicable). The estimates
are sent by the competing builders, architects,
general speculators, or by any one wishing to
contract, to the court house (without the intervention
of any person, officially or otherwise)
and they are submitted to the Board by their
clerk. The lowest contract, as the sum total of
the work, is most generally adopted, and when a
contract has been accepted, the matter seems
settled and done with, as regards the management
of the Commissioners; for the contractor at
once becomes responsible for the fulfilment of his
contract, and may and does employ whom he
pleases <i>and at what rates he pleases</i>, without fear
of any control or interference from the Court.
The work, however, is superintended by the surveyors,
to ensure its execution according to the
provisions of the agreement. The contractor is
paid by direct order of the Court.</p>

<p>The surveyors and clerks of works are mostly
limited as to their labours to the several
districts; but the superior officers are employed
in all parts, and so, if necessary, are the subordinate
officers when the work requires an extra
staff.</p>

<p>According to the Returns, the following functionaries
appear to be connected with the undermentioned
<span class="lock">districts:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Fulham, Hammersmith, Counter’s Creek, and Ranelagh.</i></li>

<p>This is called a “reduced” staff, and the reduction
of salaries is certainly very considerable.</p>

<p>If we consider the yearly emoluments of
tradesmen in businesses requiring no great extent
of education or general intelligence, the salaries
of the surveyors, clerk of the works, &amp;c., must
appear very far from extravagant; and when we
consider their responsibility and what may be
called their removability, some of the salaries
may be pronounced mean; for I think it must
be generally admitted by all, except the narrow-minded,
who look merely at the immediate
outlay as the be-all and the end-all of every
expenditure, that if the surveyors, clerks of
works, inspectors of flushing, &amp;c., be the best
men who could be procured (as they ought to
be), or at any rate be thorough masters of their
craft, they are rather underpaid than overpaid.</p>

<p>As an instance of the mismanagement of the
sewers work of the metropolis, it is but right that
the subjoined document should be published.</p>

<p>I need not offer any comment on the following
“Return to an Address of the Honourable the
House of Commons, dated 28th July, 1851,”
except that I was told early in January, on good
authority, that the matter was now worse than it
was when reported as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<i>Privy Gardens, Whitehall Yard, Scotland
Yard, &amp;c., Public Sewer.</i></p>

<p>“With reference to the two orders of the
Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Woods, &amp;c., I
have the honour to state that, since the 15th of November
(when I last sent in a memorandum), I have
frequently visited the several Crown buildings affected
by the building of the main public sewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
for draining Westminster; viz., the Earl of Malmsbury’s,
the Exchequer Bill Office, the United
Service Museum, Lord Liverpool’s, Mr. Vertue’s,
Mr. Alderman Thompson’s, and Messrs. Dalgleish’s.</p>

<p>“All these buildings have been more or less
damaged by the construction of the sewer; the
Exchequer Bill Office, the United Service Museum,
and Mr. Vertue’s, in a manner that, in my
opinion, can <i>never be effectually repaired</i>.</p>

<p>“At Lord Malmsbury’s, the party wall next
to the Exchequer Bill Office has <i>moved</i>, as shown
by some cracks in the staircase; but for this house
it may not be necessary to require more to be
done than stopping and painting.</p>

<p>“At the Exchequer Bill Office, the old Gothic
groins have been cracked in several places, and
several settlements have taken place in the walls
over and near to where the sewer passes under
the building. The shores are still standing
against this building, but it would now be better
to remove them; the cracks in the groins and
walls <i>can never be repaired</i> to render the building
so substantial as it was before. The cracks
in the basement still from month to month show
a very slight movement; those in the staircase
and roof also appear to increase. As respects
this building, I would submit to the Commissioners
of Woods that it <i>would not be advisable to permit
the surveyors of the Commissioners of Sewers
to enter and make only a surface repair of plaster
and paint</i>; but I would suggest that a careful
survey be made by surveyors appointed respectively
by the Board of Woods and the Commissioners
of Sewers, and that a thorough repair of the
building be made (so far as it is susceptible of
repair), under the Board of Woods; the Commissioners
of Sewers paying such proportion of
the cost thereof as may fairly be deemed to have
been occasioned by their proceedings.</p>

<p>“At the United Service Museum, the settlements
on the side next the sewer appear to me
very serious.</p>

<p>“The house occupied by Lord Liverpool, as
also Mr. Vertue’s house, of which his Lordship is
Crown lessee, were both affected, the former to
some extent, but not seriously; of the latter, the
west front sunk, and pulled over the whole house
with it; but as respects these two houses the
interference of the Board is, I believe, unnecessary,
Mr. Hardwicke (one of the Sewer Commissioners)
having, as architect for Lord Liverpool, caused
both to be repaired.</p>

<p>“A like repair has also been made in the
kitchen offices of Mr. Alderman Thompson’s
house, where alone any cracks appeared.</p>

<p>“At Messrs. Dalgleish and Taylor’s, very serious
injury has been done to both their buildings and
their trade. The Commissioners of Sewers have
a steam-engine still at work on those premises,
and have not yet concluded their operations there.
Some of the sheds which entirely fell down they
have rebuilt; and others, which appear in a very
defective if not dangerous state, it is understood
they propose to repair or rebuild; but as eventually
Messrs. Dalgleish and Taylor will have a very
heavy claim against them for interference with
business, and as the extent of damage to the
buildings which has been done, or may hereafter
arise, cannot at present be fully ascertained, it
would probably be advisable to postpone this
part of the subject, giving notice, however, to
the Commissioners of Sewers that it must hereafter
come under consideration.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Sewers Rate.</span></h3>

<p>Having shown the expenditure of the Commission
of Sewers, we now come to consider its
income.</p>

<p>The funds available for the sewerage and drainage
of the several towns throughout the kingdom, are
raised by means of a particular property tax,
termed the Sewers Rate. This forms part of
what are designated the <i>Local</i> Taxes of England
and Wales.</p>

<p>Local taxes are of two <span class="lock">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I. Rates raised upon property in <i>defined</i> districts,
as parishes, jurisdictions, counties, &amp;c.</p>

<p>II. Tolls, dues, and fees charged for particular
services on particular occasions, as turnpike tolls,
harbour dues, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The rates or sums raised upon the property
lying within a certain circumscribed locality, admit
of being subdivided into two <span class="lock">orders&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The rates of <i>independent</i> districts, or those
which, being required for a particular district (as
the parish or some equivalent territorial limit),
are not only levied within the bounds of that
district, but expended for the purposes of it
alone; as is the case with the poor rate.</p>

<p>2. The rates of <i>aggregate</i> districts, or those
which, though required to be expended for the
purposes of a given district (such as the county),
are raised in detail in the several inferior districts
(such as the various parishes) which compose the
larger one, and which contribute the sums thus
levied to one common fund; such is the case with
the county rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>But the rates of independent districts may be
further distinguished into two orders, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>i. Those which are levied on the same
classes of persons, the same kinds of property, and
the same principles of valuation as the poor rate;
such are the highway rate, the lighting and
watching, and the militia rate among the independent
rates; and the police, borough, and
county rates among the aggregate rates.</p>

<p>ii. Those which are <i>not</i> levied on the same
basis as the poor rate. The church and sewers
rates are familiar instances of this peculiarity.</p>

<p>The sewers rate, then, is a local tax required for
an <i>independent</i> rather than an <i>aggregate</i> district,
and is <i>not</i> levied upon the basis of the poor law.</p>

<p>The assessment of the poor rate, for instance,
includes tithes of every kind, that of the sewers
rate extends to such tithes only as are in the
hands of laymen. Again, the sewers rate embraces
some incorporeal hereditaments to which
the poor rate does not extend; but stock in trade,
which of late years has been specially exempted from
the poor rate, was never subject to the sewers rate.</p>

<p>A sewers rate, however, was known as early
as the sixth year of Henry VI. (1427), though
“commissions” were not instituted till the time
of Henry VIII. The Act which now regulates
the collection of the funds required for the cleansing,
building, repairs, and improvements of the
sewers, is 4 and 5 Vict. (1841). This statute
gives the “Courts” or “Commissions” of Sewers,
power “to tax in the gross” in each parish, &amp;c.,
all lands, &amp;c., within the jurisdiction of such
courts, for the requirements of the public sewerage.
This impost is not periodically levied, nor at any
stated or even regularly recurring term, but “as
occasion requires:” perhaps once in two or three
years. It is (with some exceptions, which require
no notice) what is commonly called “a landlord’s
tax” in the metropolis, that is, the sewers-rate
collector must be paid by the occupier of the premises,
who, on the production of the collector’s
receipt, can deduct the amount from his rent. If
this arrangement were meant to convey a notion
to the public that the sewers tax was a tax on
property&mdash;on the capitalist who owns, and not on
the tenant who merely occupies&mdash;it is a shallow
device, for every one must know that the more
sewers rate a tenant pays <i>for</i> his landlord, the
more rent he must pay <i>to</i> him.</p>

<p>The sewers rate is levied according to the rateable
value put upon property by the surveyors and
assessors appointed by the Commissioners, who
may make the rate “by such ways and means,
and in such manner and form, as to them may
seem most convenient.” It seems a question yet
to be determined whether or not there is a right
of appeal against the sewers rate, but the general
opinion is that there is <i>no appeal</i>. The rate can
be mortgaged by the Commissioners if an advance
of money is considered desirable. The maximum
of 1<i>s.</i> in the pound on the net annual value of the
property was fixed by the Act. The Commissioners
have also the power to levy a “special rate” on
any district not connected with the general system
of sewerage, but which it has been resolved should
be so connected; also an “improvement rate,” at
a maximum of 10 per cent. on the rack rent, “in
respect of works they may judge to be of private
benefit,” a provision which has called forth some
comments.</p>

<p>The metropolitan sewers rate is now collected in
nine districts.</p>

<p>There are at present 42 Commissions or Courts
of Sewers throughout England and Wales.</p>

<p>The only return which has yet been prepared
of the annual amount assessed and collected under
the authority of the Metropolitan Commission of
Sewers, is one presented to the House of Commons
in 1843. It includes the sum assessed in four of
the eight districts within the jurisdiction of the
Metropolitan Commissioners from 1831 to 1840
inclusive.</p>

<p>The two districts excluded from the above total
are the minor ones of St. Katherine and Greenwich,
so that altogether the gross sum levied
within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Commissioners
must have been between 85,000<i>l.</i> and
90,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The annual amount of the local rates in England
and Wales is, according to a work on the
subject (“The Local Taxes of the United Kingdom”),
published “under the direction of the
Poor Law Commissioners” in 1846, 8,801,838<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
In this large sum only the average annual outlay
on the six districts of the sewers of the metropolis
is included (82,097<i>l.</i>), and it is stated that not
even an approximate average could be arrived at as
regards the expenditure on sewers in the country
districts. Such absence of statistical knowledge,&mdash;and
it is a want continually observable&mdash;is little
creditable to the legislative, executive, and administrative
powers of the State.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to show, from the best data

<p>According to the present law, the Commissioners
are required to submit to Parliament yearly returns
of the money collected on account of, and expended
in, the sewerage of the metropolis.</p>

<p>I need only state, that in the latest and, indeed,
the sole returns upon the subject, the rates in 1845-6-7,
under the former separate commissions, were
1<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> in the pound on land, and from 3<i>d.</i>
(Ranelagh and Westminster) to 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> (Greenwich)
on houses.</p>

<p>The rates made under the combined and consolidated
Commissions, from 30th Nov., 1847, to 8th
Oct., 1849, were all 6<i>d.</i>, excepting the Western
division of Westminster sewers, which were 3<i>d.</i>,
and a part of the Surrey and Kent district, 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The rates under the present Metropolitan Commission,
from 8th October, 1849, to 31st July,
1851, are all 6<i>d.</i>, with a similar exception in
Surrey and Kent. The following are the only further

G. S. HATTON,<br />
<i>Accountant.</i>
</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cleansing of the Sewers&mdash;Ventilation.</span></h3>

<p>There are two modes of purifying the sewers;
the one consists in removing the foul air, the other
in removing the solid deposits. I shall deal first
with that mode of purification which consists in
the mechanical removal or chemical decomposition
of the noxious gases engendered within the sewers.</p>

<p>This is what is termed the Ventilation of the
Sewers, and forms a very important branch of the
inquiry into the character and working of the
underground refuse-channels, for it relates to the
risk of explosions and the consequent risk of destruction
to men’s lives; while, if the sewer be ill-ventilated,
the surrounding atmosphere is often
prejudicially affected by the escape of impure air
from the subterranean channels.</p>

<p>A survey as to the ventilation, &amp;c., of the
sewers was made by Mr. Hawkins, Assistant-Surveyor,
and Mr. Jenkins, Clerk of the Works. Four
examinations took place of sewers; of those in
Bloomsbury; those from Tottenham-court-road to
Norfolk-street, Strand; from the Guard-room in
Buckingham Palace to the Horseferry-road, Millbank;
and in Grosvenor-square and the streets
adjacent. There were difficulties attending the
experiment. From Castle-street to Museum-street
there was a drop of 4 feet in the levels, so that
the examiners had to advance on their hands and
knees, and it was difficult to make observations.
In some places in Westminster also the water and
silt were knee deep, and the lamps (three were used)
splashed all over. In Bloomsbury the sewers
gave no token of the presence of any gas, but in
the other places its presence was very perceptible,
especially in a sewer on the west side of Grosvenor-square,
a very low one, in which the gas was
ignited within the wire shade of one of the lamps,
but without producing any effect beyond that of
immediately extinguishing the light. There was
also during the route, in the neighbourhood of Sir
Henry Meux’s brewery and of an adjoining distillery
in Vine-street, a considerable quantity of
steam in the sewer, but it had no material effect
upon the light.</p>

<p>The examiners came to the conclusion that
where there was any liability to an explosion from
the presence of carburetted hydrogen, or other
causes, the Improved Davy Lamp afforded an
almost certain protection.</p>

<p>The attention of the Commissioners seems to
have been chiefly given of late, as regards ventilation
and indeed general improvement, to the
sewers on the Surrey side of the metropolis.
Among these a new sewer along Friar-street, running
from the Blackfriars to the Southwark-bridge-road,
is one of the most noticeable.</p>

<p>Friar-street is one of the smaller off thoroughfares,
the character of which is, perhaps, little
suspected by those who pass along the open Blackfriars-road.
As you turn out of that road to the
left hand, advancing from the bridge, almost opposite
the Magdalen Hospital, is Friar-street. On
its left hand, as you proceed along it, are gas-works,
and the factories, or work places, of tradesmen in
the soap-boiling, tallow-melting, cat and other gut
manufacturing, bone-boiling, and other noisome
callings. On the right hand are a series of short
and often neatly-built streets, but the majority of
them have the look of unmistakable squalor or
poverty, though <i>not</i> of the poverty of the industrious.
Across Flint-street, Green-street, and other
ways, few of them horse thoroughfares, hang, on a
fair day, lines of washed clothes to dry. Yellow-looking
chemises and petticoats are affixed alongside
men’s trowsers and waistcoats; coarse-featured
and brazen-looking women, with necks and faces
reddened, as if with brick-dust, from exposure to
the weather, stand at their doors and beckon to
the passers by. Perhaps in no part of the metropolis
is there a more marked manifestation of moral
obsceneness on the one hand, and physical obsceneness
on the other. With the low prostitution of
this locality is mixed the low and the bold crime
of the metropolis. Some of the off-shoots from
Friar-street communicate with places of as nefarious
a character. Hackett, whom his newspaper
admirers seem to wish to elevate into the fame of
a second Jack Sheppard, resided in this quarter.
The gang who were last winter repulsed in their
burglarious attack on Mr. Holford’s villa in the
Regent’s-park favoured the same locality, and were
arrested in their old haunts. Public-houses may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
be seen here and there&mdash;houses, perhaps, not greatly
discouraged by the police&mdash;which are at once the
rendezvous and the trap of offenders, for to and
from such resorts they can be readily traced. And
all over this place of moral degradation extends
the stench of offensive manufactures and ill-ventilated
sewers. Certainly there is now an improvement,
but it is still bad enough.</p>

<p>A Report of the 21st September, 1848, shows
that a new sewer, 1500 feet in length, had been
“put in along Friar-street, with a fall of 15 inches
from the level of the sewer in Blackfriars-road to
Suffolk-street. The sewer,” states the Report,
“with which it communicates at its upper end in
the Blackfriars-road contains nearly 2 feet in
depth of soil; it in consequence has silted up to
that level with semi-fluid black filth, principally
from the factories, of the most poisonous and
sickening description, forming an <i>elongated cesspool</i>
1500 feet in length, the filth at its lower end being
upwards of 3 feet in depth. Since the building
of this sewer, the foul matter so discharged into it
has been in a state of decomposition, constantly
giving off pestilential and poisonous gases, which
have spread into and filled the adjoining sewers;
thence they are being drawn into the houses by
the house-drains, and into the streets by the
street-drains, to such a fearful extent as to infect
the whole atmosphere of the neighbourhood, and
so to cause the very offensive odour so generally
complained of there. Sulphuretted hydrogen is
present in these sewers in large quantities, as
metals, silver and copper, are attacked and blackened
by it; and the smell from it is so sickening
as to be almost unbearable.”</p>

<p>On the question of how best to deal with sewers
such as the Friar-street, Messrs. John Roe and
John Phillips (surveyors) and Mr. Henry Austin
(consulting engineer) have agreed in the following
<span class="lock">opinion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The most simple and convenient method would
be by placing large strong fires in shafts directly
over the crown of the sewers. The expense of
each furnace, with the inclosure around it, will be
about 20<i>l.</i> The fires would be fed almost constantly,
by which little smoke would be generated.
The heat to be produced from these fires would
rarefy the air so much as to create rapidly ascending
currents in the shafts, and strong draughts
through the sewers, the foul air in which would
then be drawn to the fires and there consumed;
and as it was being destroyed fresh air would be
drawn in at all the existing inlets of house and
street drains, pushing forward and supplying the
place of the foul air.”</p>

<p>Concerning the explosions of, or deaths in, the
sewers from the impure gases, there is, I believe,
no statistical account. The most remarkable
catastrophe of this kind was the death of five
persons in a sewer in Pimlico, in October, 1849;
of these, three were regular sewer-men, and the
others were a policeman and Mr. Wells, a surgeon,
who went into the sewer in the hopes of giving
assistance. Mr. Phillips, the then chief surveyor
of the Commission of Sewers, stated that the cause
of these deaths in the sewers was entirely an
exceptional case, and the gas which had caused
the accident inquired into was not a sewer gas.
“There is often,” he said, “a great escape of gas
from the mains, which found its way into the sewers.
The gas, however, which has done the mischief
in the present instance would not explode.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ure’s opinion was, that the deceased men
died from asphixia, caused by inhaling sulphuretted
hydrogen and carbonic acid gas in mixture with
prussic vapour, and that these noxious emanations
were derived from the refuse lime of gas-works
thrown in with other rubbish to make up the road
above the sewer. Other scientific gentlemen attributed
the five deaths to the action of sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, or, according to Dr. Lyon Playfair,
to be chemically correct, hydro-sulphate of ammonia.
The coroner (Mr. Bedford), in summing up,
said that Mr. Phillips wished it to be supposed
that gas lime was the cause of the foul gas; and
Dr. Ure said that gas lime had to do with the
calamity. But Dr. Miller, Mr. Richard Phillips,
Mr. Campbell, and Dr. Playfair, more especially
the latter, were perfectly sure that lime had nothing
to do with it. The verdict was the following:&mdash;“We
find that Daniel Pert, Thomas Gee, and
John Attwood died from the inhalation of noxious
gas generated in a neglected and unventilated
sewer in Kenilworth-street. And we find that
Henry Wells and John Walsh met their deaths
from the same cause, in their laudable endeavours
to save the lives of the first three sufferers. The jury
unanimously consider the commissioners and officers
of the Metropolitan Sewers are much to blame for
having neglected to avail themselves of the unusual
advantages offered, from the local situation of the
Grosvenor-canal, for the purpose of flushing the
sewers in this district.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of “Flushing” and “Plonging,” and other
Modes of Washing the Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>The next step in our inquiry&mdash;and that which
at present concerns us more than any other&mdash;is
the mode of removing the solid deposits from the
sewers, as well as the condition of the workmen
connected with that particular branch of labour.
The sewers are the means by which a larger proportion
of the wet refuse of the metropolis is removed
from our houses, and we have now to consider
the means by which the more solid part of
this refuse is removed from the sewers themselves.
The latter operation is quite as essential to health
and cleanliness as the former; for to allow the
filth to collect in the channels which are intended
to remove it, and there to remain decomposing
and vitiating the atmosphere of the metropolis,
is manifestly as bad as not to remove it at all;
and since the more solid portions of the sewage
<i>will</i> collect and form hard deposits at the bottom
of each duct, it becomes necessary that some
means should be devised for the periodical purgation
of the sewers themselves.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FLUSHING THE SEWERS.</p>

<p>(<i>Partly from a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>,
<i>and partly from a Sketch kindly lent by</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Whiting</span>.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>There have been two modes of effecting this
object. The one has been the <i>carting</i> away of
the more solid refuse, and the other the <i>washing</i>
of it away, or, as it is termed, <i>flushing</i> in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of the <i>covered</i> sewers, and <i>plonging</i> in the case of
the <i>open</i> ones. Under both systems, whether the
refuse be carted or flushed away, the hard deposit
has to be first loosened by manual labourers&mdash;the
difference consisting principally in the means of
after-removal.</p>

<p>The first of these systems&mdash;viz., the cartage
method&mdash;was that which prevailed in the metropolis
till the year 1847. I shall therefore give
a brief description of this mode of cleansing the
sewers before proceeding to treat of the now
more general mode of “flushing.”</p>

<p>Under the old system, the clearing away of the
deposit was a “nightman’s” work, differing little,
except in being more toilsome, offensive to the
public, and difficult. A hole was made from the
street down into the sewer where the deposit was
thickest, and the deposit was raised by means of a
tub, filled below, drawn up to the street, and
emptied into a cart, or spread in mounds in the
road to be shovelled into some vehicle. A nightman
told me that this mode of work was sometimes
a great injury to his trade, because “when
it was begun on a night many of the householders
sleeping in the neighbourhood used to say to
themselves, or to their missusses, as they turned
in their beds, ‘It’s them ere cussed cesspools
again! I wish they was done away with.’ An’
all the time, sir, the cesspools was as hinnocent
and as sweet as a hangel.”</p>

<p>This clumsy and filthy process is now but
occasionally resorted to. A man who had superintended
a labour of this kind in a narrow,
but busy thoroughfare in Southwark, told me that
these sewer labourers were the worst abused men
in London. No one had a good word for them.</p>

<p>But there have been other modes of removing
the indurated sewage, besides that of cartage;
and which, though not exactly flushing, certainly
consisted in allowing the deposit to be washed
away. Some of these contrivances were curious
enough.</p>

<p>I learn from a Report printed in 1849, that the
King’s Scholars’ Pond Sewer, in the city of
Westminster, running near the Abbey, contained
a continuous bed of deposit, of soil, sand, and
filth, from 10 to 30 inches in depth, and this for
a mile and a half next the river&mdash;the first mile
yielding more than 6000 loads of matter. This
sewer was to be cleansed.</p>

<p>“We first used a machine,” says Mr. J. Lysander
Hale, “in the form of a plough and
harrow combined; a horse dragged it through the
deposit in the sewer; one man attended the
horse, and another guided the plough. The work
done by this machine, in cutting a channel through
the soil and causing the water to move through it
quickly, was effectual to remove the deposit; but
as the sewer is a tidal sewer, and its sole entrance
for a horse being its outlet, the machine could only
be used for a small part of any day. Sometimes
with a strong breeze up the river, the tide would
not recede sufficiently to permit the horse to get
in at all (and it did not appear advisable to incur
the expense of 50<i>l.</i> to build a sideway entrance
for the animal), so that under these circumstances
we were obliged to discontinue the use of the
horse and plough; which, under other circumstances,
would have been very effective.” From this
time, I understand, the sewers of London have remained
unploughed by means of horse labour.</p>

<p>But the plough was not altogether abandoned,
and as horse-power was not found very easily applicable,
water-power was resorted to. The
plough and harrow were attached to a barge,
which was introduced into the sewer. The
sluice gates were kept shut until the ebb of the
tide made the difference of level between the
contents of the sewer and the surface of the
Thames equal to some eight feet. “The gates
were then suddenly opened, and the rapid and
deep current of water following, was then sufficient
to bring the barge and plough down the sewer
with a force equal to five or six horse-power.”</p>

<p>This last-mentioned method was also soon
abandoned. We now come to the more approved
plan of “flushing.”</p>

<p>“The term ‘<i>flushing</i> sewers’ implies,” says Mr.
Haywood, in his Report, “cleansing by the application
of <i>bodies</i> of water in the sewers; this is
periodically effected, varying in intervals according
to the necessities of the sewerage or other circumstances.”</p>

<p>The flushing system has a two-fold object, viz.,
to remove old deposits and prevent the accumulation
of new. When the deposit is not allowed
to accumulate and harden, “flushing consists,”
says Mr. Haywood, “simply in heading back and
letting off <i>flush at once</i>” (hence the origin of the
term) “that which has been delivered into the
sewers in a certain number of hours by the
various houses draining into them, diluted with
large quantities of water specially employed for
the purpose.”</p>

<p>Though the operation of “flushing” is one of
modern introduction, as regards the metropolis&mdash;one,
indeed, which may be said to have originated
in the modern demand for improved sanitary regulations&mdash;it
has been practised in some country
parts since the days of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Flushing was practised also by those able engineers,
the ancient Romans. One of the grand
architectural remains of that people, the best
showing their system of flushing, is in the Amphitheatre
at Nismes, in France. The site of the
ruined amphitheatre presents a large elliptical
area, 114,251 superficial feet comprising its extent.
Around the arena ran a large sewer 3 feet
6 inches in width, and 4 feet 9 inches in height.
With this sewer, elliptical in shape, 348 pipes
communicated, carrying into it the rain-fall and
the refuse caused by the resort of 23,000 persons,
for the seats alone contained that number. “The
system of flushing, practised here,” says Mr.
Cresy, “with such advantage, deserves to be
noticed, there being means of driving through
this elliptical sewer a volume of water at pleasure,
with such force that no solid matter could by any
possibility remain within any of the drains or
sewers. An aqueduct, 2 feet 8 inches in width,
and 6 feet in height, brought this water from the
reservoirs of Nismes, not only to fill but to purge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
the whole of these sewers; after traversing the
arena, it deviated a little to the south-west, where
it was carried out at the sixth arcade, east of the
southern entrance. Man-holes and steps to descend
into this capacious vaulted aqueduct were
introduced in several places; and there can be no
doubt that by directing for some hours such a
stream of water through it, the greatest cleanliness
was preserved throughout all the sewers of the
building.”</p>

<p>The flushing of sewers appears to have been
introduced into the metropolis by Mr. John Roe
in the year 1847, but did not come into general
use till some years later. There used to be a
partial flushing of the London sewers twelve years
ago. The mode of flushing as at present practised
is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first instance the inspector examines
and reports the condition of the sewer, and receives
and issues his orders accordingly. When
the sewer is ordered to be flushed&mdash;and there is
no periodical or regular observance of time in the
operation&mdash;the men enter the sewers and rake up
the deposit, loosening it everywhere, so as to render
the whole easy to be swept along by the power of
the volume of water. The sewers generally are, in
their widest part, provided with grooves, or, as the
men style them, “framings.” Into these framings
are fitted, or permanently attached, what I
heard described as “penstocks,” but which are
spoken of in some of the reports as “traps,”
“gates,” or “sluice gates.” They are made both
of wood and iron. By a series of bolts and adjustments,
the penstocks can be fixed ready for use
when the tide is highest in the sewer, and the
volume of water the greatest. They then, of course,
are in the nature of dams, the water having accumulated
in consequence of the stoppage. The deposit
having been loosened, the bolts are withdrawn,
when the gates suddenly fly back, and the
accumulated water and stirred-up sewage sweeps
along impetuously, while the men retreat into
some side recesses adapted for the purpose. The
same is done with each penstock until the matter
is swept through the outlet. The men always
follow the course of this sewage-current when the
sewer is of sufficient capacity to enable them to do
so, throwing or pushing forward any more solid
matter with their shovels.</p>

<p>“To flush we generally go and draw a slide
up and let a flush of water down,” said one man
to me, “and then we have iron rakers to loosen
the stuff. We have got another way that we do
it as well; one man stands here, when the flush
of water’s coming down, with a large board; then
he lets the water rise to the top of this board, and
then there’s two or three of us on ahead, with
shovels, loosening the stuff&mdash;then he ups with
this board and lets a good heavy flush of water
come down. Precious hard work it is, I can
assure you. I’ve had many a wet shirt. We
stand up to our fork in the water, right to the top
of our jack-boots, and sometimes over them.”
“Ah, I should think you often get over the top
of yours, for you come home with your stockings
wet enough, goodness knows,” exclaimed his wife,
who was present. “When there’s a good flush
of water coming down,” he resumed, “we’re
obligated to put our heads fast up against the
crown of the sewer, and bear upon our shovels, so
that we may not be carried away, and taken bang
into the Thames. You see there’s nothing for
us to lay hold on. Why, there was one chap
went and lifted a slide right up, when he ought
to have had it up only 9 or 10 inches at the
furthest, and he nearly swamped three of us. If
we should be taken off our legs there’s a heavy
fall&mdash;about 3 feet&mdash;just before you comes to the
mouth of the sewer, and if we was to get there,
the water is so rapid nothing could save us.
When we goes to work we nails our lanterns up
to the crown of the sewer. When the slide is
lifted up the rush is very great, and takes all
before it. It roars away like a wild beast.
We’re always obliged to work according to tide,
both above and below ground. When we have
got no water in the sewer we shovels the dirt up
into a bank on both sides, so that when the flush
of water comes down the loosened dirt is all
carried away by it. After flushing, the bottom
of the sewer is as clean as this floor, but in a
couple of months the soil is a foot to 15 inches
deep, and middling hard.”</p>

<p>“Flushing-gates,” an engineer has reported,
“are chiefly of use in sewers badly constructed
and without falls, but containing plenty of water;
and they are of very little use where the gate has
to be shut 24 hours and longer, before a head of
water has accumulated; but where intermittent
flushing is practised, strong smells are often caused
<i>solely</i> by the stagnation of the water or sewage
while accumulating behind the gate.”</p>

<p>The most general mode of flushing at present
adopted is not to keep in the water, &amp;c., which
has flowed into the sewer from the streets and
houses, as well as the tide of the river, but to
convey the flushing water from the plugs of the
water companies into the kennels, and so into the
sewers. I find in one of the Reports acknowledgments
of the liberal supplies granted for flushing
by the several companies. The water of the
Surrey Canal has been placed, for the same object,
at the disposal of the Sewer Commissioners.</p>

<p>It is impossible to “flush” at all where a sewer
has a “dead-end;” that is, where there is a
“block,” as in the case of the Kenilworth-street
sewer, Pimlico, in which five persons lost their
lives in 1848.</p>

<p>There is no difference in the system of flushing
in the Metropolitan and City jurisdictions, except
that for the greater facilities of the process, the
City provides water-tanks in Newgate-market,
where the heads of three sewers meet, and where
the accumulation of animal garbage, and the
fierceness and numbers of the rats attracted
thereby, were at one time frightful; at Leadenhall-market,
and elsewhere, such tanks were also
provided to the number of ten, the largest being
the Newgate-market tank, which is a brick cistern
of 8000 gallons capacity. Of these tanks, however,
only four are now kept filled, for this collection
of water is found unnecessary, the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
system of flushing answering the purpose without
them; and I understand that in a little time there
will be no tanks at all. The tank is filled, when
required, by a water company, and the penstocks
being opened, the water rushes into the sewers
with great force. There is also another point
peculiar to the City&mdash;in it all the sewers are
flushed regularly twice a week; in the metropolitan
sewers, only when the inspector pronounces
flushing to be required. The City plan
appears the best to prevent the accumulation of
deposit.</p>

<p>There still remains to be described the system
of “<i>plonging</i>,” or mode of cleansing the open
sewers, as contradistinguished from “<i>flushing</i>,” or
the cleansing of the covered sewers.</p>

<p>“When we go plonging,” one man said, “we
has long poles with a piece of wood at the end of
them, and we stirs up the mud at the bottom of
the ditches while the tide’s a going down. We
has got slides at the end of the ditches, and we
pulls these up and lets out the water, mud, and
all, into the Thames.” “Yes, for the people to
drink,” said a companion drily. “We’re in the
water a great deal,” continued the man. “We
can’t walk along the sides of all of ’em.”</p>

<p>The difference of cost between the old method
of removal and the new, that is to say, between
carting and flushing, is very extraordinary.</p>

<p>This cartage work was done chiefly by contract
and according to a Report of the surveyors to the
Commissioners (Aug. 31, 1848), the usual cost
for such work (almost always done during the
night) was 7<i>s.</i> the cubic yard; that is, 7<i>s.</i> for the
removal of a cubic yard of sewage by manual
labour and horse and cart. In February, 1849
(the date of another Report on the subject), the
cost of removing a cubic yard by the operation of
flushing, was but 8<i>d.</i> This gives the following
result, but in what particular time, instance, or
locality, is not <span class="lock">mentioned:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td class="left"><span class="diri4">Difference</span></td><td class="total">£25,170</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>“It appears, therefore,” says Mr. Lovick,
“that by the adoption of the contract flushing
system, a saving has been effected within the
comparatively short period of its operation
over the filthy and clumsy system formerly
practised, of 25,170<i>l.</i>, showing the cost of this
system to be ten and a half times greater than the
cost of flushing by contract.”</p>

<p>An official Report states: “When the accumulations
of years had to be removed from the
sewers, the rate of cost per lineal mile has varied
from about 40<i>l.</i> to 58<i>l.</i>, or from 6<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> per
lineal yard. The works in these cases (excepting
those in the City) have not exceeded nine
lineal miles.”</p>

<p>“On an average of weeks,” says Mr. Lovick,
in his Report on flushing operations, a few months
after the introduction of the contract system, in
Sept., 1848, “under present arrangements, about
62 miles of sewers are passed through each week,
and deposit prevented from accumulating in them
by periodic (weekly) flushing. The average cost
per lineal mile per week is about 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“The nature of the agreements with the contractors
or gangers are now for the prevention of
accumulations of deposit in a district. For this
purpose the large districts are subdivided, each
subdivision being let to one man. In the Westminster
district there are four, in the Holborn and
Finsbury two, in the Surrey and Kent, seven subdivisions.</p>

<p>“The Tower Hamlets and Poplar districts are
each let to one man.</p>

<p>“In the Tower Hamlets it will be perceived
that a reduction of 8<i>l.</i> has been effected for the
performance of precisely the same work as that
heretofore performed; the rates of charge standing
<span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In those portions specially contracted for, the
work has been let by the lineal measure of the
sewer, in preference to the amount of deposit removed.</p>

<p>“In the Surrey and Kent districts the open
ditches have been cleansed thrice as often as
formerly.</p>

<p>“A large proportion of the deposit removed is
from the open ditches; in these the accumulations
are rapid and continuous, caused chiefly by their
being the receptacles for the ashes and refuse of
the houses, the refuse of manufactories, and the
sweepings of the roads.</p>

<p>“In the covered sewers one of the chief sources
of accumulation is the detritus and mud from the
streets, swept into the sewers.</p>

<p>“The accumulations from these sources will not,
I think, be over-estimated at two-thirds of the
whole amount of deposit removed.</p>

<p>Hence there would appear to have been a
saving of 25<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> effected. But by what means
was this brought about? It is the old story, I
regret to say&mdash;a reduction of the wages of the
labouring men. But this, indeed, is the invariable
effect of the contract system. The wages of the
flushermen previous to Sept., 1848, were 24<i>s.</i> to
27<i>s.</i> a week; under the present system they are
21<i>s.</i> to 22<i>s.</i> Here is a reduction of 4<i>s.</i> per week
per man, at the least; and as there were about
150 hands employed at this period, it follows that
the gross weekly saving must have been equal to
30<i>l.</i>, so that, according to the above account, there
would have been about 5<i>l.</i> left for the contractors
or middlemen. It is unworthy of <i>gentlemen</i> to
make a parade of economy obtained by such ignoble
means.</p>

<p>The engineers, however, speak of flushing as
what is popularly understood as but “a make-shift”&mdash;as
a system imperfect in itself, but advantageously
resorted to because obviating the
evils of a worse system still.</p>

<p>“With respect to these operations,” says Mr.
Lovick, in a Report on the subject, in February,
1849, “I may be permitted to state that, although
I do not approve of the flushing as an ultimate
system, or as a system to be adopted in the
future permanent works of sewerage, or that its
use should be contemplated with regulated sizes
of sewers, regulated supplies of water, and proper
falls, it appears to be the most efficacious and
economical for the purpose to which it is adapted
of any yet introduced.”</p>

<p>A gentleman who was at one time connected
professionally with the management of the public
sewerage, said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. John Roe commenced the general system
of flushing sewers in London in 1847. It is,
however, but a clumsy expedient, and quite incompatible
with a perfect system of sewerage.
It has, nevertheless, been usefully applied as an
auxiliary to the existing system, though the cost
is frightful.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Working Flushermen.</span></h3>

<p>When the system of sewer cleansing first became
general, as I have detailed, the number of flushermen
employed, I am assured, on good authority,
was about 500. The sewers were, when
this process was first resorted to, full of deposit,
often what might be called “coagulated” deposit,
which could not be affected except by constantly
repeated efforts. There are now only about 100
flushermen, for the more regularly flushing is
repeated, the easier becomes the operation.</p>

<p>Until about 18 months ago, the flushermen
were employed directly by the Court of Sewers,
and were paid (“in Mr. Roe’s time,” one man
said, with a sigh) from 24<i>s.</i> to 27<i>s.</i> a week; now
the work is <i>all done by contract</i>. There are some
six or seven contractors, all builders, who undertake
or are responsible for the whole work of
flushing in the metropolitan districts (I do not
speak of the City), and they pay the working
flushermen 21<i>s.</i> a week, and the gangers 22<i>s.</i>
This wage is always paid in money, without drawbacks,
and without the intervention of any other
middleman than the contractor middleman. The
flushermen have no perquisites except what they
may chance to find in a sewer. Their time of
labour is 6&frac12; hours daily.</p>

<p>The state of the tide, however, sometimes, as a
matter of course, compels the flushermen to work
at every hour of the day and night. At all
times they carry lights, common oil lamps, with
cotton wicks; only the inspectors carry Davy’s
safety-lamp. I met no man who could assign
any reason for this distinction, except that “the
Davy” gave “such a bad light.”</p>

<p>The flushermen wear, when at work, strong
blue overcoats, waterproofed (but not so much as
used to be the case, the men then complaining of
the perspiration induced by them), buttoned close
over the chest, and descending almost to the
knees, where it is met by huge leather boots,
covering a part of the thigh, such as are worn by
the fishermen on many of our coasts. Their hats
are fan-tailed, like the dustmen’s. The flushermen
are well-conducted men generally, and, for
the most part, fine stalwart good-looking specimens
of the English labourer; were they not known or
believed to be temperate, they would not be employed.
They have, as a body, no benefit or sick
clubs, but a third of them, I was told, or perhaps
nearly a third, were members of general benefit
societies. I found several intelligent men among
them. They are engaged by the contractors, upon
whom they call to solicit work.</p>

<p>“Since Mr. Roe’s time,” and Mr. Roe is evidently
the popular man among the flushermen,
or somewhat less than four years ago, the flushermen
have had to provide their own dresses, and
even their own shovels to stir up the deposit. To
contractors, the comforts or health of the labouring
men must necessarily be a secondary consideration
to the realization of a profit. New men
can always be found; safe investments cannot.</p>

<p>The wages of the flushermen therefore have been
not only decreased, but their expenses increased.
A pair of flushing-boots, covering a part of the
thigh, similar to those worn by sea-side fishermen,
costs 30<i>s.</i> as a low price, and a flusherman wears
out three pairs in two years. Boot stockings cost
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The jacket worn by the men at their work
in the sewers, in the shape of a pilot-jacket, but
fitting less loosely, is 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a blue smock, of
coarse common cloth (generally), worn over the
dress, costs 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; a shovel is 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> “Ay, sir,”
said one man, who was greatly dissatisfied with
this change, “they’ll make soldiers find their
own regimentals next; and, may be, their own
guns, a’cause they can always get rucks of men
for soldiers or labourers. I know there’s plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
would work for less than we get, but what of that?
There always is. There’s hundreds would do
the work for half what the surveyors and inspectors
gets; but it’s all right among the nobs.”</p>

<p>Nor is the labour of the flushermen at all times
so easy or of such circumscribed hours as I have
stated it to be in the regular way of flushing.
When small branch-sewers have to be flushed, the
deposit must first be loosened, or the water, instead
of sweeping it away, would flow over it, and in
many of these sewers (most frequent in the Tower
Hamlets) the height is not more than 3 feet.
Some of the flushermen are tall, bulky, strong
fellows, and cannot stand upright in less than
from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet, and in loosening
the deposit in low narrow sewers, “we go to
work,” said one of them, “on our bellies, like
frogs, with a rake between our legs. I’ve been
blinded by steam in such sewers near Whitechapel
Church from the brewhouses; I couldn’t see for
steam; it was a regular London fog. You must
get out again into a main sewer on your belly;
that’s what makes it harder about the togs, they
get worn so.”</p>

<p>The division of labour among the flushermen
appears to be as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>Inspector</i>, whose duty it is to go round the
several sewers and see which require to be flushed.</p>

<p>The <i>Ganger</i>, or head of the working gang, who
receives his orders from the inspector, and directs
the men accordingly.</p>

<p>The <i>Lock-keeper</i>, or man who goes round to the
sewers which are about to be flushed, and fixes
the “penstocks” for retaining the water.</p>

<p>The <i>Gang</i>, which consists of from three to four
men, who loosen the deposit from the bottom of the
sewer. Among these there is generally a “for’ard
man,” whose duty it is to remove the penstocks.</p>

<p>The ganger gets 1<i>s.</i> a week over and above the
wages of the men.</p>

<p>Holborn and Finsbury districts are under one contractor, and so are the two divisions of Westminster. The same
men who flush Holborn flush the Finsbury district also, 17 being the average number employed; but the Finsbury
district requires rather more men than the Holborn; and the same men who work on the western division of
Westminster flush also the eastern, the number of flushers in the western district being more, on account of its being
the larger division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>The inspector receives 80<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>The table on p. <a href="#Page_429">429</a> shows the number of clerks
of the works, inspectors of flushing, flap and sluice
keepers, gangers, and flushermen employed in the
several districts throughout the metropolis, as well
as the salaries and wages of each and the whole.</p>

<p>None of the flushermen can be said to have
been “brought up to the business,” for boys are
never employed in the sewers. Neither had the
labourers been confined in their youth to any
branch of trade in particular, which would appear
to be consonant to such employment. There are
now among the flushermen men who have been
accustomed to “all sorts of ground work:” tailors,
pot-boys, painters, one jeweller (some time ago
there was also one gentleman), and shoemakers.
“You see, sir,” said one informant, “many of such
like mechanics can’t live above ground, so they
tries to get their bread underneath it. There used
to be a great many pensioners flushermen, which
weren’t right,” said one man, “when so many
honest working men haven’t a penny, and don’t
know which way to turn theirselves; but pensioners
have often good friends and good interest.
I don’t hear any complaints that way now.”</p>

<p>Among the flushermen are some ten or twelve
men who have been engaged in sewer-work of one
kind or another between 20 and 30 years. The
cholera, I heard from several quarters, did not
(in 1848) attack any of the flushermen. The
answer to an inquiry on the subject generally was,
“Not one that I know of.”</p>

<p>“It is a somewhat singular circumstance,” says
Mr. Haywood, the City Surveyor, in his Report,
dated February, 1850, “<i>that none of the men
employed in the City sewers in flushing and
cleansing, have been attacked with, or have died
of, cholera during the past year; this was also the
case in 1832-3</i>. I do not state this to prove that
the atmosphere of the sewers is not unhealthy&mdash;I
by no means believe an impure atmosphere is
healthy&mdash;but I state the naked fact, as it appears
to me a somewhat singular circumstance, and leave
it to pathologists to argue upon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think flushing work disagrees with my
husband,” said a flusherman’s wife to me, “for he
eats about as much again at that work as he did at
the other.” “The smell underground is sometimes
very bad,” said the man, “but then we
generally take a drop of rum first, and something
to eat. It wouldn’t do to go into it on an empty
stomach, ’cause it would get into our inside. But
in some sewers there’s scarcely any smell at all.
<i>Most of the men are healthy who are engaged in
it; and when the cholera was about many used to
ask us how it was we escaped.</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following statement contains the history of
an individual <span class="lock">flusherman:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was brought up to the sea,” he said, “and
served on board a man-of-war, the <i>Racer</i>, a 16-gun
brig, laying off Cuba, in the West Indies, and there-away,
watching the slavers. I served seven years.
We were paid off in ’43 at Portsmouth, and a
friend got me into the <i>shores</i>. It was a great
change from the open sea to a close <i>shore</i>&mdash;great;
and I didn’t like it at all at first. But it suits a
married man, as I am now, with a family, much
better than being a seaman, for a man aboard a ship
can hardly do his children justice in their schooling
and such like. Well, I didn’t much admire
going down the man-hole at first&mdash;the ‘man-hole’
is a sort of iron trap-door that you unlock and
pull up; it leads to a lot of steps, and so you get
into the <i>shore</i>&mdash;but one soon gets accustomed to
anything. I’ve been at flushing and <i>shore</i> work
now since ’43, all but eleven weeks, which was
before I got engaged.</p>

<p>“We work in gangs from three to five men.” [Here
I had an account of the process of flushing, such
as I have given.] “I’ve been carried off my feet
sometimes in the flush of a <i>shore</i>. Why, to-day,”
(a very rainy and windy day, Feb. 4,) “it came
down Baker-street, when we flushed it, 4 foot
plomb. It would have done for a mill-dam. One
couldn’t smoke or do anything. Oh, yes, we can
have a pipe and a chat now and then in the <i>shore</i>.
The tobacco checks the smell. No, I can’t say I
felt the smell very bad when I first was in a
<i>shore</i>. I’ve felt it worse since. I’ve been made
innocent drunk like in a <i>shore</i> by a drain from a
distiller’s. That happened me first in Vine-street
<i>shore</i>, St. Giles’s, from Mr. Rickett’s distillery.
It came into the <i>shore</i> like steam. No, I can’t
say it tasted like gin when you breathed it&mdash;only
intoxicating like. It was the same in
Whitechapel from Smith’s distillery. One night
I was forced to leave off there, the steam had
such an effect. I was falling on my back, when
a mate caught me. The breweries have something
of the same effect, but nothing like so strong
as the distilleries. It comes into the <i>shore</i> from
the brewers’ places in steam. I’ve known such
a steam followed by bushels of grains; ay, sir,
cart-loads washed into the <i>shore</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, I never found anything in a <i>shore</i>
worth picking up but once a half-crown. That
was in the Buckingham Palace sewer. Another
time I found 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and thought that <i>was</i> a haul;
but every bit of it, every coin, shillings and sixpences
and joeys, was bad&mdash;all smashers. Yes,
of course it was a disappointment, naturally so.
That happened in Brick-lane <i>shore</i>, Whitechapel.
O, somebody or other had got frightened, I suppose,
and had shied the coins down into the drains. I
found them just by the chapel there.”</p>

<p>A second man gave me the following account of
his experience in <span class="lock">flushing:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“You remember, sir, that great storm on the 1st
August, 1848. I was in three <i>shores</i> that fell in&mdash;Conduit-street
and Foubert’s-passage, Regent-street.
There was then a risk of being drowned
in the <i>shores</i>, but no lives were lost. All the
house-drains were blocked about Carnaby-market&mdash;that’s
the Foubert’s-passage <i>shore</i>&mdash;and the
poor people was what you might call houseless. We
got in up to the neck in water in some places,
’cause we had to stoop, and knocked about the
rubbish as well as we could, to give a way to the
water. The police put up barriers to prevent any
carts or carriages going that way along the streets.
No, there was no lives lost in the <i>shores</i>. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
man was so overcome that he was falling off into
a sort of sleep in Milford-lane <i>shore</i>, but was
pulled out. I helped to pull him. He was as
heavy as lead with one thing or other&mdash;wet, and
all that. Another time, six or seven year ago,
Whitechapel High-street <i>shore</i> was almost choked
with butchers’ offal, and we had a great deal of
trouble with it.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Rats in the Sewers.</span></h3>

<p>I will now state what I have learned from long-experienced
men, as to the characteristics of the
rats in the sewers. To arrive even at a conjecture
as to the numbers of these creatures&mdash;now, as it
were, the population of the sewers&mdash;I found impossible,
for no statistical observations have been
made on the subject; but all my informants
agreed that the number of the animals had been
greatly diminished within these four or five years.</p>

<p>In the better-constructed sewers there are no
rats. In the old sewers they abound. The sewer
rat is the ordinary house or brown rat, excepting at
the outlets near the river, and here the water-rat
is seen.</p>

<p>The sewer-rat is the common brown or Hanoverian
rat, said by the Jacobites to have come in
with the first George, and established itself after
the fashion of his royal family; and undoubtedly
such was about the era of their appearance. One
man, who had worked twelve years in the
sewers before flushing was general, told me he
had never seen but <i>two</i> black (or old English)
rats; another man, of ten years’ experience, had
seen but one; others had noted no difference in
the rats. I may observe that in my inquiries as
to the sale of rats (as a part of the live animals
dealt in by a class in the metropolis), I ascertained
that in the older granaries, where there were series
of floors, there were black as well as brown rats.
“Great black fellows,” said one man who managed
a Bermondsey granary, “as would frighten
a lady into asterisks to see of a sudden.”</p>

<p>The rat is the only animal found in the sewers.
I met with no flusherman or other sewer-worker
who had ever seen a lizard, toad, or frog there,
although the existence of these creatures, in such
circumstances, has been presumed. A few live
cats find their way into the subterranean channels
when a house-drain is being built, or is opened for
repairs, or for any purpose, and have been seen by
the flushermen, &amp;c., wandering about, looking lost,
mewing as if in misery, and avoiding any contact
with the sewage. The rats also&mdash;for they are not
of the water-rat breed&mdash;are exceedingly averse to
wetting their feet, and “take to the sewage,” as it
was worded to me, only in prospect of danger;
that is, they then swim across or along the current
to escape with their lives. It is said that when a
luckless cat has ventured into the sewers, she is
sometimes literally worried by the rats. I could
not hear of such an attack having been witnessed
by any one; but one intelligent and trustworthy
man said, that a few years back (he believed about
eight years) he had in one week found the skeletons
of two cats in a particular part of an old
sewer, 21 feet wide, and in the drains opening
into it were perfect colonies of rats, raging with
hunger, he had no doubt, because a system of
trapping, newly resorted to, had prevented their
usual ingress into the houses up the drains. A
portion of their fur adhered to the two cats, but
the flesh had been eaten from their bones. About
that time a troop of rats flew at the feet of another
of my informants, and would no doubt have
maimed him seriously, “but my boots,” said he,
“stopped the devils.” “The sewers generally
swarms with rats,” said another man. “I runs
away from ’em; I don’t like ’em. They in general
gets away from us; but in case we comes to a
stunt end where there’s a wall and no place for ’em
to get away, and we goes to touch ’em, they fly at
us. They’re some of ’em as big as good-sized
kittens. One of our men caught hold of one the
other day by the tail, and he found it trying to
release itself, and the tail slipping through his
fingers; so he put up his left hand to stop it, and
the rat caught hold of his finger, and the man’s
got an arm now as big as his thigh.” I heard
from several that there had been occasionally
battles among the rats, one with another.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said one flusherman, “as to the
number of rats, it ain’t possible to say. There
hasn’t been a census (laughing) taken of them.
But I can tell you this&mdash;I was one of the first
flushermen when flushing came in general&mdash;I
think it was before Christmas, 1847, under Mr.
Roe&mdash;and there was cart-loads and cart-loads of
drowned rats carried into the Thames. It was in
a West Strand <i>shore</i> that I saw the most. I
don’t exactly remember which, but I think
Northumberland-street. By a block or a hitch of
some sort, there was, I should say, just a bushel
of drowned rats stopped at the corner of one of
the gates, which I swept into the next stream.
I see far fewer drowned rats now than before the
<i>shores</i> was flushed. They’re not so plenty, that’s
one thing. Perhaps, too, they may have got to
understand about flushing, they’re that ’cute, and
manage to keep out of the way. About Newgate-market
was at one time the worst for rats. Men
couldn’t venture into the sewers then, on account
of the varmint. It’s bad enough still, I hear, but
I haven’t worked in the City for a few years.”</p>

<p>The rats, from the best information at my command,
do not derive much of their sustenance
from the matter in the sewers, or only in particular
localities. These localities are the sewers
neighbouring a connected series of slaughter-houses,
as in Newgate-market, Whitechapel, Clare-market,
parts adjoining Smithfield-market, &amp;c.
There, animal offal being (and having been to a
much greater extent five or six years ago) swept
into the drains and sewers, the rats find their food.
In the sewers, generally, there is little food for
them, and none at all in the best-constructed
sewers, where there is a regular and sometimes
rapid flow, and little or no deposit.</p>

<p>The sewers are these animals’ breeding grounds.
In them the broods are usually safe from the
molestation of men, dogs, or cats. These “breeding
grounds” are sometimes in the holes (excavated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the industry of the rats into caves) which have
been formed in the old sewers by a crumbled brick
having fallen out. Their nests, however, are in
some parts even more frequent in places where old
rotting large house-drains or smaller sewers, empty
themselves into a first-class sewer. Here, then, the
rats breed, and, in spite of precautions, find their
way up the drains or pipes, even through the openings
into water-closets, into the houses for their
food, and almost always at night. Of this fact,
builders, and those best informed, are confident,
and it is proved indirectly by what I have stated
as to the deficiency of food for a voracious creature
in all the sewers except a few. One man, long in
the service of the Commissioners of Sewers, and
in different capacities, gave me the following
account of what may be called a rat settlement.
The statement I found confirmed by other working
men, and by superior officers under the same employment.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, in the Milford-lane sewer, a goodish
bit before you get to the river, or to the Strand&mdash;I
can’t say how far, a few hundred yards perhaps&mdash;I’ve
seen, and reported, what was a regular
chamber of rats. If a brick didn’t fall out
from being rotted, the rats would get it out, and
send it among other rubbish into the sewer, for
this place was just the corner of a big drain. I
couldn’t get into the rat-hole, of course not, but
I’ve brought my lamp to the opening, and&mdash;as
well as others&mdash;have seen it plain. It was an
open place like a lot of tunnels, one over another.
Like a lot of rabbit burrows in the country&mdash;as
I’ve known to be&mdash;or like the partitions in the
pigeon-houses: one here and another there. The
rat-holes, as far as I could tell, were worked one
after another. I should say, in moderation, that
it was the size of a small room; well, say about
6 yards by 4. I can’t say about the height from
the lowest tunnel to the highest. I don’t see
that any one could. Bless you, sir, I’ve sometimes
heerd the rats fighting and squeaking there,
like a parcel of drunken Irishmen&mdash;I have indeed.
Some of them were rare big fellows. If you threw
the light of your lamp on them sudden, they’d
be off like a shot. Well, I should say, there was
100 pair of rats there&mdash;there might be more,
besides all their young-uns. If a poor cat strayed
into that sewer, she dursn’t tackle the rats, not
she. There’s lots of such places, sir, here, and
there, and everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I believe rats,” says a late enthusiastic writer
on the subject, under the cognomen of Uncle
James, “to be one of the most fertile causes of
national and universal distress, and their attendants,
misery and starvation.”</p>

<p>From the author’s inquiries among practical
men, and from his own study of the natural history
of the rat, he shows that these animals will
have six, seven, or eight nests of young in the
year, for three or four years together; that they
have from twelve to twenty-three at a litter, and
breed at three months old; and that there are
more female than male rats, by ten to six.</p>

<p>The author seems somewhat of an enthusiast
about rats, and as the sewerage is often the head-quarters
of these animals&mdash;their “breeding-ground”
indeed&mdash;I extract the following curious matter.
He <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Now, I propose to lay down my calculations
at something less than one-half. In the first
place, I say four litters in the year, beginning and
ending with a litter, so making thirteen litters in
three years; secondly to have eight young ones
at a birth, half male and half female; thirdly,
the young ones to have a litter at six months
old.</p>

<p>“At this calculation, I will take one pair of rats;
and at the expiration of three years what do you
suppose will be the amount of living rats? Why
no less a number than 646,808.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shaw’s little dog ‘Tiny,’ under six
pounds weight, has destroyed 2525 pairs of rats,
which, had they been permitted to live, would, at
the same calculation and in the same time, have
produced 1,633,190,200 living rats!</p>

<p>“And the rats destroyed by Messrs. Shaw and
Sabin in one year, amounting to 17,000 pairs,
would, had they been permitted to live, have produced,
at the above calculation and in the same
time, no less a number than 10,995,736,000
living rats!</p>

<p>“Now, let us calculate the amount of human
food that these rats would destroy. In the first
place, my informants tell me that six rats will
consume day by day as much food as a man;
secondly, that the thing has been tested, and that
the estimate given was, that eight rats would
consume more than an ordinary man.</p>

<p>“Now, I&mdash;to place the thing beyond the
smallest shadow of a doubt&mdash;will set down ten
rats to eat as much as a man, not a child; nor
will I say anything about what rats waste.
And what shall we find to be the alarming result?
Why, that the first pair of rats, with their
three years’ progeny, would consume in the night
more food than 64,680 men the year round, and
leaving eight rats to spare!”</p>

<p>The author then puts forth the following curious
<span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“And now for the vermin destroyed by Messrs.
Shaw and Sabin&mdash;34,000 yearly! Taken at the
same calculation, with their three years’ progeny&mdash;can
you believe it?&mdash;they would consume more
food than the whole population of the earth?
Yes, if Omnipotence would raise up 29,573,600
more people, these rats would consume as much
food as them all! You may wonder, but I will
prove it to you:&mdash;The population of the earth,
including men, women, and children, is estimated
to be 970,000,000 souls; and the 17,000 rats in
three years would produce 10,995,736,000: consequently,
at ten rats per man, there would be sufficient
rats to eat as much food as all the people on
the earth, and leaving 1,295,736,000. So that if
the human family were increased to 1,099,573,600,
instead of 970,000,000, there would be rats
enough to eat the food of them all! Now, sirs,
is not this a most appalling thing, to think that
there are at the present time in the British Empire
thousands&mdash;nay, millions&mdash;of human beings
in a state of utter starvation, while rats are con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>suming
that which would place them and their
families in a state of affluence and comfort? I
ask this simple question: Has not Parliament,
ere now, been summoned upon matters of far
less importance to the empire? I think it has.”</p>

<p>The author then advocates the repeal of the
“rat-tax,” that is, the tax on what he calls the
“true friend of man and remorseless destroyer
of rats,” the well-bred terrier dog. “Take the
tax off rat-killing dogs” he says, “and give a
legality to rat-killing, and let there be in
each parish a man who will pay a reward per
head for dead rats, which are valuable for
manure (as was done in the case of wolves in
the old days), and then rats would be extinguished
for ever!” Uncle James seems to be a
perfect Malthus among rats. The over-population
and over-rat theories are about equal in
reason.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cesspoolage and Nightmen of
the Metropolis.</span></h3>

<p>I have already shown&mdash;it may be necessary to
remind the reader&mdash;that there are two modes
of removing the wet refuse of the metropolis:
the one by carrying it off by means of sewers,
or, as it is designated, <i>sewerage</i>; and the other
by depositing it in some neighbouring cesspool,
or what is termed <i>cesspoolage</i>.</p>

<p>The object of sewerage is “to transport the
wet refuse of a town to a river, or some powerfully
current stream, by a series of ducts.” By
the system of cesspoolage, the wet refuse of
the household is collected in an adjacent
tank, and when the reservoir is full, the contents
are removed to some other part.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LONDON NIGHTMEN.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The gross quantity of wet refuse annually
produced in the metropolis, and which consequently
has to be removed by one or other of
the above means, is, as we have seen,&mdash;liquid,
24,000,000,000 gallons; solid, 100,000 tons;
or altogether, by admeasurement, 3,820,000,000
cubic feet.</p>

<p>The quantity of this wet refuse which finds
its way into the sewers by street and house-drainage
is, according to the experiments of
the Commissioners of Sewers (as detailed at
p. <a href="#Page_388">388</a>), 10,000,000 cubic feet per day, or
3,650,000,000 cubic feet per annum, so that
there remain about 170,000,000 cubic feet to
be accounted for. But, as we have before seen,
the extent of surface from which the amount
of so-called <i>Metropolitan</i> sewage was <i>removed</i>
was only 58 square miles, whereas that from
which the calculation was made concerning
the gross quantity of wet refuse <i>produced</i>
throughout the metropolis was 115 square
miles, or double the size. The 58 miles measured
by the Commissioners, however, was by
far the denser moiety of the town, and that
in which the houses and streets were as 15 to 1;
so that, allowing the remaining 58 miles of the
suburban districts to have produced 20 times
less sewage than the urban half of the metropolis,
the extra yield would have been about
180,500,000 cubic feet. But the greater proportion,
if not the whole, of the latter quantity
of wet house-refuse would be drained into open
ditches, where a considerable amount of evaporation
and absorption is continually going on, so
that a large allowance must be made for loss by
these means. Perhaps, if we estimate the
quantity of sewage thus absorbed and evaporated
at between 10 and 20 per cent of the
whole, we shall not be wide of the truth, so
that we shall have to reduce the 182,000,000
cubic feet of suburban sewage to somewhere
about 150,000,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>This gives us the quantity of wet refuse
carried off by the sewers (covered and open) of
the metropolis, and deducted from the gross
quantity of wet house-refuse, annually <i>produced</i>
(3,820,000,000 cubic feet), leaves 20,000,000
cubic feet for the gross quantity carried off by
other means than the sewers; that is to say,
the 20,000,000 cubic feet, if the calculation be
right, should be about the quantity deposited
every year in the London cesspools. Let us
see whether this approximates to anything
like the real quantity.</p>

<p>To ascertain the absolute quantity of wet
refuse annually conveyed into the metropolitan
cesspools, we must first ascertain the number
and capacity of the cesspools themselves.</p>

<p>Of the city of London, where the sewer-cesspool
details are given with a minuteness highly
commendable, as affording statistical data of
great value, Mr. Heywood gives us the following
<span class="lock">returns:&mdash;</span></p>


<h4>“<span class="smcap">House-Drainage of the City</span>.</h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">“The total number of premises drained during the year was</td><td>310</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">“The approximate number of premises drained at the expiration of the year 1850 was</td><td>10,923</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">“The total number of premises which may now therefore be said to be drained is</td><td>11,233</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">“And undrained</td><td>5,067</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>“I am induced,” adds Mr. Heywood, “to believe,
from the reports of the district inspectors,
that a very far larger number of houses are
already drained than are herein given. Indeed
my impression is, that as many as 3000 might
be deducted from the 5067 houses as to the
drainage of which you have no information.</p>

<p>“Now, until the inspectors have completed
their survey of the whole of the houses within
the city,” continues the City surveyor, “precise
information cannot be given as to the number
of houses yet undrained; such information
appears to me very important to obtain speedily,
and I beg to recommend that instructions be
given to the inspectors to proceed with their
survey as rapidly as possible.”</p>

<p>Hence it appears, that out of the 16,299
houses comprised within the boundaries of the
City, rather less than one-third are <i>reported</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
have cesspools. Concerning the number of cesspools
without the City, the Board of Health, in
a Report on the cholera in 1849, put forward
one of its usual <i>extraordinary</i> statements.</p>

<p>“At the last census in 1841,” runs the Report,
“there were 270,859 houses in the metropolis.
<i>It is</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOWN</span> <i>that there is scarcely a house
without a cesspool under it, and that a large number
have two, three, four, and</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">MORE</span> <i>under them</i>;
so that the number of such receptacles in the
metropolis may be taken at 300,000. The exposed
surface of each cesspool measures on an
average 9 feet, and the mean depth of the whole
is about 6&frac12; feet; so that each contains 58&frac12; cubic
feet of fermenting filth of the most poisonous,
noisome, and disgusting nature. The exhaling
surface of all the cesspools (300,000 × 9)
= 2,700,000 feet, or equal to 62 acres nearly;
and the total quantity of foul matter contained
within them (300,000 × 58&frac12;) = 17,550,000
cubic feet; or equal to one enormous elongated
stagnant cesspool 50 feet in width, 6 feet 6
inches in depth, and extending through London
from the Broadway at Hammersmith to
Bow-bridge, a length of 10 miles.</p>

<p>“This,” say the Metropolitan Sanitary Commissioners,
a body of functionaries so intimately
connected with the Board, that the one is ever
ready to swear to what the other asserts, “there
is reason to believe is an <i>under estimate!</i>”</p>

<p>Let us now compare this statement, which
declares it to be <i>known</i> that there is scarcely a
house in London without a cesspool, and that
many have two, three, four, and even more
under them&mdash;let us compare this, I say, with
the facts which were elicited by the same functionaries
by means of a house-to-house inquiry
in three different parishes&mdash;a poor, a middle-class,
and a rich one&mdash;the average rental of
each being 22<i>l.</i>, 119<i>l.</i>, and 128<i>l.</i></p>

<p>In this minute and searching investigation
there is not only an official guide to an estimation
of the number of cesspools in London, but
a curious indication of the character of the
houses in the respective parishes. In the
poorer parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark,
the cesspools were to every 100 houses
as 82·12; in the aristocratic parish of St. James,
Westminster, as only 36·62; while in what may
be represented, perhaps, as the middle-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
parish of St. Anne, Soho, the cesspools were
47·27 per cent. The number of wells on or
near the premises, and the proportion of those
tainted; the ratio of the dampness of the lower
parts of the houses, of the stagnant water
on the premises, and of the flooding of the
houses on occasions of storms, are all significant
indications of the difference in the circumstances
of the inhabitants of these parishes&mdash;of
the difference between the abodes of the
rich and the poor, the capitalists and the labouring
classes. But more significant still,
perhaps, of the domestic wants or comforts of
these dwellings, is the proportion of water-closets
to the houses in the poor parish and
the rich; in the one they were but 10·06 per
cent; in the other 65·86 per cent.</p>

<p>These returns are sufficient to show the extravagance
of the Board’s previous statement,
that there is “scarcely a house in London
without a cesspool under it,” while “a large
number have two, three, four, and more,” for
we find that even in the poorer parishes there
are only 82 cesspools to 100 houses. Moreover,
the engineers, after an official examination and
inquiry, reported that in the “fever-nest, known
as Jacob’s-island, Bermondsey,” there were
1317 dwelling-houses and 648 cesspools, or not
quite 50 cesspools to 100 houses.</p>

<p>In rich, middle-class, and poor parishes, the
proportion of cesspools, then, it appears from
the <i>inquiries</i> of the Board of Health (their
<i>guesses</i> are of no earthly value), gives us an
average of something between 50 or 60 cesspools
to every 100 houses. A subordinate
officer whom I saw, and who was engaged in
the cleansing and the filling-up of cesspools
when condemned, or when the houses are to
be drained anew into the sewers and the cesspools
abolished, thought from his own experience,
the number of cesspools to be less than
one-half, but others thought it more.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a nightman told me he
was confident that every two houses in three
throughout London had cesspools; in the City,
however, we perceive that there is, at the utmost,
only one house in every three undrained.
It will, therefore, be safest to adopt a middle
course, and assume 50 per cent of the houses
of the metropolis to be still without drainage
into the sewers.</p>

<p>Now the number of houses being 300,000,
it follows that the number of cesspools within
the area of the metropolis are about 150,000;
consequently the next step in the investigation
is to ascertain the average capacity of each, and
so arrive at the gross quantity of wet house-refuse
annually deposited in cesspools throughout
London.</p>

<p>The average size of the cesspools throughout
the metropolis is said, by the Board of Health,
to be 9 feet by 6&frac12;, which gives a capacity of
58&frac12; cubic feet, and this for 150,000 houses =
8,775,000 cubic feet. But according to all accounts
these cesspools require on an average
two years to fill, so that the gross quantity of
wet refuse annually deposited in such places
can be taken at only half the above quantity,
viz. in round numbers, 4,500,000 cubic feet.
This by weight, at the rate of 35·9 cubic feet
to the ton, gives 125,345 tons. This, however,
would appear to be of a piece with the generality
of the statistics of the Board of Health,
and as wide of the truth as was the statement
that there was scarcely a house in London without
a cesspool, while many had <i>three, four, and
even more</i>. But I am credibly informed that
the average size of a cesspool is rather more
than 5 feet square and 6&frac12; deep, so that the ordinary
capacity would be 5&frac34; × 5&frac14; × 6&frac12; = 197
cubic feet, and this multiplied by 150,000 gives
an aggregate capacity of 29,550,000 cubit feet.
But as the cesspools, according to all accounts,
become full only once in two years, it follows
that the gross quantity of cesspoolage annually
deposited throughout the metropolis must be
only one-half that quantity, or about 14,775,000
cubic feet.</p>

<p>The calculation may be made another way,
viz. by the experience of the nightmen and
the sewer-cesspoolmen as to the average quantity
of refuse removed from the London cesspools
whenever emptied, as well as the average
number emptied yearly.</p>

<p>The contents of a cesspool are never estimated
for any purpose of sale or labour by the
weight, but always, as regards the nightmen’s
work, by the load. Each night-cart load of
soil is considered, on an average, a ton in weight,
so that the nightmen readily estimate the number
of tons by the number of cart-loads obtained.
The men employed in the cleansing of the cesspools
by the new system of pumping agree with
the nightmen as to the average contents of a
cesspool.</p>

<p>As a general rule, a cesspool is filled every two
years, and holds, when full, about five tons.
One man, who had been upwards of 30 years in
the nightman’s business, who had worked at it
more or less all that time himself, and who is
now foreman to a parish contractor and master-nightman
in a large way, spoke positively on
the subject. The cesspools, he declared, were
emptied, as an average, by nightmen, once in
two years, and their average contents were five
loads of night-soil, it having been always understood
in the trade that a night-cartload was
about a ton.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The total of the cesspool matter
is not affected by the frequency or paucity of the
cleansing away of the filth, for if one cesspool
be emptied yearly, another is emptied every
second, third, fourth, or fifth year, and, according
to the size, the fair average is five tons of
cesspoolage emptied from each every other year.
One master-nightman had emptied as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
fourteen tons of night-soil from a cesspool or
soil-tank, and a contractor’s man had once
emptied as many as eighteen tons, but both
agreed as to the average of five tons every two
years from all. Neither knew the period of the
accumulation of the fourteen or the eighteen
tons, but supposed to be about five or six
years.</p>

<p>According to this mode of estimate, the quantity
of wet house-refuse deposited in cesspools
would be equal to 150,000 × 5, or 750,000 tons
every two years. This, by admeasurement, at
the rate of 35·9 cubic feet to the ton, gives
26,925,000 cubic feet; and as this is the accumulation
of two years, it follows that 13,462,500
cubic feet is the quantity of cesspoolage deposited
yearly.</p>

<p>There is still another mode of checking this
estimate.</p>

<p>I have already given (see p. <a href="#Page_385">385</a>, <i>ante</i>) the
average production of each individual to the wet
refuse of the metropolis. According to the experiments
of Boussingault, confirmed by Liebig,
this, as I have stated, amounted to &frac14; lb. of solid
and 1&frac14; lb. of liquid excrement from each individual
per diem (= 150 lbs. for every 100 persons),
while, including the wet refuse from
culinary operations, the average yield, according
to the surveyor of the Commissioners of
Sewers, was equal to about 250 lbs. for every
100 individuals daily. I may add that this calculation
was made officially, with engineering
minuteness, with a view to ascertain what
quantity of water, and what inclination in its
flow, would be required for the effective working
of a system of drainage to supersede the cesspools.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Now the census of 1841 shows us that
the average number of inhabitants to each
house throughout the metropolis was 7·6, and
this for 150,000 houses would give 1,140,000
people; consequently the gross quantity of wet
refuse proceeding from this number of persons,
at the rate of 250 lbs. to every 100 people daily,
would be 464,400 tons per annum; or, by admeasurement,
at the rate of 35·9 cubic feet to
the ton, it would be equal to 16,670,950 cubic
feet.</p>

<p>A small proportion of this amount of cesspoolage
ultimately makes its appearance in the
sewers, being pumped into them directly from
the cesspools when full by means of a special apparatus,
and thus tends not only to swell the
bulk of sewage, but to decrease in a like proportion
the aggregate quantity of wet house-refuse,
which is removed by cartage; but though
the proportion of cesspoolage which finally appears
as sewage is daily increasing, still it is but
trifling compared with the quantity removed by
cartage.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have three different estimates
as to the gross quantity of the London cesspoolage,
each slightly varying from the other two.</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td></td><td>Cubic Feet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The first, drawn from the average capacity of the London cesspools, makes the gross annual amount of cesspoolage</td><td>14,775,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>The second, deduced from the average quantity removed from each cesspool</td><td>13,462,500</td></tr>
<tr><td>And the third, calculated from the individual production of wet refuse</td><td>16,670,950</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The mean of these three results is, in round
numbers, 15,000,000 cubic feet, so that the
statement would stand <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">The quantity of wet house-refuse annually carried off by sewers (chiefly covered) from the urban moiety of the metropolis is (in cubic feet)</td><td>3,650,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The quantity annually carried off by sewers (principally open) from the suburban moiety of the metropolis</td><td>150,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The total amount of wet house-refuse annually carried off by the sewers of the metropolis</td><td class="total">3,800,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The gross amount of wet house-refuse annually deposited in cesspools throughout the metropolis</td><td>15,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">The total amount of sewage and cesspoolage of the metropolis </td><td class="total">3,815,000,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus we perceive that the total quantity of
wet house-refuse annually <i>removed</i>, corresponds
so closely with the gross quantity of wet house-refuse
annually <i>produced</i>, that we may briefly
conclude the gross sewage of London to be
equal to 3,800,000,000 cubic feet, and the gross
cesspoolage to be equal to 15,000,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the above conclusion may be
tested by another process; for, unless the Board
of Health’s conjectural mode of getting at <i>facts</i>
be adopted, it is absolutely necessary that statistics
not only upon this, but indeed any subject,
be checked by all the different modes there
may be of arriving at the same conclusion.
False facts are worse than no facts at all.</p>

<p>The number of nightmen may be summed
up as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table class="right" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Masters</td><td>521</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Labourers</td><td>200,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The number of cesspools emptied during the
past year by these men may be estimated at
50,692; and the quantity of soil removed, 253,460
loads, or tons, and this at the rate of 35·9 cubic
ft. to the ton gives a total of 6,099,214 cubic ft.</p>

<p>It might, perhaps, be expected, that from
the quantity of fæcal refuse proceeding from the
inhabitants of the metropolis, a greater quantity
would be found in the existent cesspools; but
there are many reasons for the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>One prime cause of the dispersion of cesspoolage
is, that a considerable quantity of the
night-soil does not find its way into the cesspools
at all, but is, when the inhabitants have
no privies to their dwellings, thrown into
streets, and courts, and waste places.</p>

<p>I cannot show this better than by a few extracts
from Dr. Hector Gavin’s work, published
in 1848, entitled, “Sanitary Ramblings; being
Sketches and Illustrations of Bethnal Green,
&amp;c.”</p>

<p>“<i>Digby-walk, Globe-road.</i>&mdash;Part of this place
is private property, and the landlord of the new
houses has built a cesspool, into which to drain
his houses, but he will not permit the other
houses to drain into this cesspool, unless the
parish pay to him 1<i>l.</i>, a sum which it will not
pay.” Of course the inhabitants throw their
garbage and filth into the street or the by-places.</p>

<p>“<i>Whisker’s-gardens.</i>&mdash;This is a very extensive
piece of ground, which is laid out in neat plots,
as gardens. The choicest flowers are frequently
raised here, and great taste and considerable refinement
are evidently possessed by those who
cultivate them. Now, among the cultivators are
the poor, even the very poor, of Bethnal-green....
Attached to all these little plots of
ground are summer-houses. In the generality of
cases they are mere wooden sheds, cabins, or
huts. It is very greatly to be regretted that the
proprietors of these gardens should permit the
slight and fragile sheds in them to be converted
into abodes for human beings.... Sometimes
they are divided into rooms; they are
planted on the damp undrained ground. The
privies are sheds erected over holes in the
ground; the <i>soil itself</i> is removed from these
holes and is <i>dug into the ground</i> to promote its
fertility.</p>

<p>“<i>Three Colt-lane.</i>&mdash;A deep ditch has been
dug on either side of the Eastern Counties
Railway by the Company. These ditches were
dug by the Company to prevent the foundations
of the arches being endangered, and are in no
way to be considered as having been dug to
promote the health of the neighbourhood.
The double privies attached to the new houses
(22 in number) are immediately contiguous to
this ditch, and are constructed so that the
night-soil shall drain into it. For this purpose
the cesspools are small, and the bottoms are
above the level of the ditch.”</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply such proofs of
night-soil not finding its way into the cesspools,
but the subject need not be further pursued, important
as in many respects it may be. I need
but say, that in the several reports of the
Board of Health are similar accounts of other
localities. The same deficiency of cesspoolage
is found in Paris, and from the same cause.</p>

<p>What may be the quantity of night-soil which
becomes part of the contents of the street
scavenger’s instead of the nightman’s cart, no
steps have been taken, or perhaps can be
taken, by the public sanitary bodies to ascertain.
Many of the worst of the nuisances
(such as that in Digby-street) have been
abolished, but they are still too characteristic
of the very poor districts. The fault, however,
appears to be with the owners of property, and
it is seldom <i>they</i> are coerced into doing their
duty. The doubt of its “paying” a capitalist
landlord to improve the unwholesome dwellings
of the poor seems to be regarded as a far more
sacred right, than the right of the people to be
delivered from the foul air and vile stenches
to which their poverty may condemn them.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, the great but unascertained
waste from cesspool evaporation, and
it must be recollected that of the 2&frac12; lbs. of
cesspool refuse, calculated as the daily produce
of each individual, 2&frac14; lbs. are liquid.</p>

<p>The gross cesspoolage of Paris should amount
to upwards of 600,000 cubic mètres, or more
than 21,000,000 cubic feet, at the estimate
of three pints daily per head. The quantity
actually collected, however, amounts to only
230,000 cubic mètres, or rather more than
8,000,000 cubic feet, which is 13,000,000 cubic
feet less than the amount produced.</p>

<p>In London, the cesspoolage of 150,000 <i>undrained</i>
houses should, at the rate of 2&frac12; lbs.
to each individual and 15 inhabitants to every
two houses, amount to 16,500,000 cubic feet,
or about 460,000 loads, whereas the quantity
collected amounts to but little more than
250,000 loads, or about 9,000,000 cubic feet.
Hence, the deficiency is 210,000 loads, or
7,500,000 cubic feet, which is nearly half of
the entire quantity.</p>

<p>In Paris, then, it would appear that only 38
per cent of the refuse which is not removed
by sewers is collected in the cesspools, whereas
in London about 54&frac12; per cent is so collected.
The remainder in both cases is part deposited
in by-places and removed by the scavenger’s
cart, part lost in evaporation, whereas a large
proportion of the deficiency arises from a less
quantity of water than the amount stated being
used by the very poor.</p>

<p>We have now to see the means by which
this 15,000,000 cubic feet of cesspoolage is
annually removed, as well as to ascertain the
condition and incomes of the labourers engaged
in the removal of it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cesspool System of London.</span></h3>

<p>A cesspool, or some equivalent contrivance,
has long existed in connexion with the structure
of the better class of houses in the
metropolis, and there seems every reason to
believe&mdash;though I am assured, on good authority,
that there is no public or official
record of the matter known to exist&mdash;that
their use became more and more general, as
in the case of the sewers, after the rebuilding
of the City, consequent upon the great fire
of 1666.</p>

<p>The older cesspools were of two kinds&mdash;“soil-tanks”
and “bog-holes.”</p>

<p>“Soil-tanks” were the filth receptacles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the larger houses, and sometimes works of
solid masonry; they were almost every size
and depth, but always perhaps much deeper
than the modern cesspools, which present an
average depth of 6 feet to 6&frac12; feet.</p>

<p>The “bog-hole” was, and is, a cavity dug
into the earth, having less masonry than the
soil-tank, and sometimes no masonry at all,
being in like manner the receptacle for the
wet refuse from the house.</p>

<p>The difference between these old contrivances
and the present mode is principally
in the following respect: the soil-tank or bog-hole
formed a receptacle immediately under
the privy (the floor of which has usually to be
removed for purposes of cleansing), whereas
the refuse is now more frequently carried into
the modern cesspool by a system of drainage.
Sometimes the soil-tank was, when the nature
of the situation of the premises permitted, in
some outer place, such as an obscure part of
the garden or court-yard; and perhaps two or
more bog-holes were drained into it, while
often enough, by means of a grate or a trap-door,
any kind of refuse to be got rid of was
thrown into it.</p>

<p>I am informed that the average contents of
a bog-hole (such as now exist) are a cubic
yard of matter; some are round, some oblong,
for there is, or was, great variation.</p>

<p>Of the few remaining soil-tanks the varying
sizes prevent any average being computable.</p>

<p>What the old system of cesspoolage <i>was</i> may
be judged from the fact, that until somewhere
about 1830 no cesspool matter could, without
an indictable offence being committed, be
drained into a sewer! <i>Now</i>, no new house
can be erected, but it is an indictable offence
if the cesspool (or rather water-closet) matter
be drained anywhere else than into the sewer!
The law, at the period specified, required most
strangely, so that “the drains and sewers
might not be choked,” that cesspools should
“be not only periodically emptied, but <i>made</i>
by nightmen.”</p>

<p>The principal means of effecting the change
from cesspoolage to sewerage was the introduction
of Bramah’s water-closets, patented
in 1808, but not brought into general use for
some twenty years or more after that date.
The houses of the rich, owing to the refuse
being drained away from the premises, improved
both in wholesomeness and agreeableness,
and so the law was relaxed.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of cesspools, viz. <i>public</i>
and <i>private</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>public cesspools</i> are those situated in
courts, alleys, and places, which, though often
packed thickly with inhabitants, are not horse-thoroughfares,
or thoroughfares at all; and in
such places one, two, or more cesspools receive
the refuse from all the houses. I do not know
that any official account of public cesspools
has been published as to their number, character,
&amp;c., but their number is insignificant
when compared with those connected with
private houses. The public cesspools are
cleansed, and, where possible, filled up by
order of the Commissioners of Sewers, the
cost being then defrayed out of the rate.</p>

<p>The <i>private cesspools</i> are cleansed at the expense
of the occupiers of the houses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Cesspool and Sewer System of
Paris.</span></h3>

<p>As the Court of Sewers have recently adopted
some of the French regulations concerning
cesspoolage, I will now give an account of the
cesspool system of France.</p>

<p>When after the ravages of the epidemic cholera
of 1848-9, sanitary commissioners under
the authority of the legislature pursued their
inquiries, it was deemed essential to report
upon the cesspool system of Paris, as that
capital had also been ravaged by the epidemic.
The task was entrusted to Mr. T. W. Rammell,
C.E.</p>

<p>Even in what the French delight to designate&mdash;and
in some respects justly&mdash;the most refined
city in the world, a filthy and indolent custom,
once common, as I have shown, in England, still
prevails. In Paris, the kitchen and <i>dry</i> house-refuse
(and formerly it was the fæcal refuse
also) is deposited in the dark of the night in
the streets, and removed, as soon as the morning
light permits, by the public scavengers.
But the refuse is not removed unexamined
before being thrown into the cart of the proper
functionary. There is in Paris a large and
peculiar class, the chiffonniers (literally, in
Anglo-Saxon rendering, the <i>raggers</i>, or rag-finders).
These men nightly traverse the
streets, each provided with a lantern, and
generally with a basket strapped to the back;
the poorer sort, however&mdash;for poverty, like
rank, has its gradations&mdash;make a bag answer
the purpose; they have also a pole with an
iron hook to its end; and a small shovel.
The dirt-heaps or mounds of dry house-refuse
are carefully turned over by these men; for
their morrow’s bread, as in the case of our
own street-finders, depends upon <i>something</i>
saleable being acquired. Their prizes are
bones (which sometimes they are seen to
gnaw); bits of bread; wasted potatoes; broken
pots, bottles, and glass; old pans and odd
pieces of old metal; cigar-ends; waste-paper,
and rags. Although these people are known
as rag-pickers, rags are, perhaps, the very
thing of which they pick the least, because
the Parisians are least apt to throw them
away. In some of the criminal trials in the
French capital, the chiffonniers have given evidence
(but not much of late) of what they
have found in a certain locality, and supplied
a link, sometimes an important one, to the evidence
against a criminal. With these refuse
heaps is still sometimes mixed matter which
should have found its way into the cesspools,
although this is an offence punishable, and
occasionally punished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the habits of the Parisians are too
freely condemned, let it be borne in mind that
the houses of the French capital are much
larger than in London, and that each floor is
often the dwelling-place of a family. Such is
generally the case in London in the poorer
districts, but in Paris it pervades almost all
districts. There, some of the houses contain
70, not fugitive but permanent, inmates. The
average number of inhabitants to each house,
according to the last census, was upwards of
<i>twenty-four</i> (in London the average is 7·6),
the extremes being eleven to each house in
St. Giles’s and between five and six in the
immediate suburbs (see p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a>, <i>ante</i>). Persons
who are circumstanced then, as are the Parisians,
can hardly have at their command the
proper means and appliances for a sufficient
cleanliness, and for the promotion of what we
consider&mdash;but the two words are unknown to
the French language&mdash;the <i>comforts</i> of a <i>home</i>.</p>

<p>“The greater portion of the liquid refuse,”
writes Mr. Rammell, “including water, which
has been used in culinary or cleansing processes,
is got rid of by means of open channels
laid across the court-yards and the foot pavements
to the street gutters, along which it
flows until it falls through the nearest gully
into the sewers, and ultimately into the Seine.
If produced in the upper part of a house, this
description of refuse is first poured into an
external shoot branching out of the rainwater
pipe, with one of which every floor is usually
provided. Iron pipes have been lately much
introduced in place of the open channels across
the foot pavements; these are laid level with
the surface, and are cast with an open slit,
about one inch in width, at the top, to afford
facility for cleansing. During the busy parts
of the day there are constant streams of such
fluids running through most of the streets of
Paris, the smell arising from which is by no
means agreeable. In hot weather it is the
practice to turn on the public stand pipes for
an hour or two, to dilute the matter and accelerate
its flow.”</p>

<p>“With respect to fæcal refuse,” says Mr.
Rammell, “and much of the house-slops, particularly
those of bed-chambers, the <i>cesspool</i>
is universally adopted in Paris as the immediate
receptacle.”</p>

<p>By far the greater proportion of the wet
house-refuse of Paris, therefore, is deposited
in cesspools.</p>

<p>I shall, then, immediately proceed to show
the quantity of matter thus collected yearly,
as well as the means by which it is removed.</p>

<p>The aggregate <i>quantity</i> of the cesspool matter
of Paris has greatly increased in quantity
within the present century, though this might
have been expected, as well from the increase
of population as from the improved construction
of cesspools (preventing leakage), and
the increased supply of water in the French
metropolis.</p>

<p>The following figures show both the aggregate
quantity and the increase that has taken
place in the cesspoolage of Paris, from 1810
to the present <span class="lock">time:&mdash;</span></p>

</table></div>

<p>This shows an increase in 36 years of very
nearly 400 per cent, but still it constitutes
little more than one-half the cesspoolage of
London.</p>

<p>The quantity of refuse matter which is daily
drawn from the cesspools, Mr. Rammell states&mdash;and
he had every assistance from the authorities
in prosecuting his inquiries&mdash;at “between
600 and 700 cubic mètres; (21,180 and
24,710 cubic feet), giving, in round numbers,
the annual quantity of 230,000 cubic
mètres.</p>

<p>“Dividing this annual quantity at 230,000
cubic mètres (or 8,000,000 cubic feet) by the
number of the population of Paris (94,721 individuals,
according to the last census), we
have 243 litres only as the annual produce
from each individual. The daily quantity of
matter (including water necessary for cleanliness)
passing from each person into the
cesspool in the better class of houses is stated
to be 1&frac34; litre (3·08 pints), or 638 litres annually.
The discrepancy between these two
quantities, wide as it is, must be accounted
for by the fact of a large proportion of the
lower orders in Paris rarely or ever using any
privy at all, and by allowing for the small
quantity of water made use of in the inferior
class of houses. There can be no doubt that
this latter quantity of 1&frac34; litre daily is very
nearly correct, and not above the average
quantity used in houses where a moderate
degree of cleanliness is observed. This proportion
was ascertained to hold good in the
case of some barracks in Paris, where the
contents of the cesspools were accurately
measured, the total quantity divided by the
number of men occupying the barracks, and
the quotient by the number of days since the
cesspools had been last emptied; the result
showing a daily quantity of 1&frac34; litre from each
individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>“The average charge per cubic mètre for
extraction and transport of the cesspoolage is
nine francs, giving a gross annual charge of
2,070,000 francs (82,800<i>l.</i> sterling), which
sum, it would appear, is paid every year by
the house-proprietors of Paris for the extraction
of the matter from their cesspools, and
its transport to the Voirie.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rammell says that, were a tubular
system of house-drainage, such as has been
described under the proper head, adopted in
Paris, in lieu of the present mode, it would
cost less than one-tenth of the expense now
incurred.</p>

<p>The principal place of deposit for the
general refuse of Paris has long been at
Montfaucon. A French writer, M. Jules
Garnier, in a recent work, “A Visit to Montfaucon,”
says:&mdash;“For more than nine hundred
years Montfaucon has been devoted to
this purpose. There the citizens of Paris deposited
their filth before the walls of the
capital extended beyond what is now the
central quarter. The distance between Paris
and Montfaucon was then more than a mile
and a half.” Thus it appears that Montfaucon
was devoted to its present purposes,
of course in a much more limited degree, as
early as the reign of King Charles the Simple.</p>

<p>This deposit of cesspool matter is the
property of the commune (as in the city of
London it would be said to belong to the
“corporation”), and it is farmed out, for
terms of nine years, to the highest bidders.
The amount received by the commune has
greatly increased, as the following returns,
which are official, will <span class="lock">show:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is here that the “<i>poudrette</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> of which I
have spoken elsewhere, is prepared. Besides
this branch of commerce, Montfaucon has
establishments for the extracting of ammonia
from the cesspool matter, and the right of
doing so is now farmed out for 80,000 francs
a-year (3200<i>l</i>).</p>

<p>Montfaucon is on the north side of Paris,
and the place of refuse deposit is known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
the Voirie. The following account of it, and
of the manufacture of poudrette, is curious in
many <span class="lock">respects:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The area, which is about 40 acres in extent,
is divided into three irregular <span class="lock">compartments:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“1. The system of basins.</p>

<p>“2. The ground used for spreading and
drying the matter.</p>

<p>“3. The place where the matter is heaped
up after having been dried.</p>

<p>“The basins, standing for the most part in
gradations, one above another, by reason of
the slope of the ground, are six in number.
The two upper ones, which are upon a level,
first receive the soil upon its arrival at the
Voirie; the four others are receptacles for
the more liquid portion as it gradually flows
off from the upper basins.</p>

<p>“There is a great difference in the character
of the soil brought; that taken from
the upper part of the cesspools, and amounting
to a large proportion of the whole, being
entirely liquid; while the remainder is more
or less solid, according to the depth at which
it is taken. The whole, however, during
winter or rainy weather, is indiscriminately
deposited in the upper basins; but in dry
weather, the nearly solid portion is at once
thrown upon the drying-ground.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>at prices of 7, 8, and 9 francs the setier.</p>

<p>“This is equal, at the average price of
8 francs, to 22,400<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p>“The refuse liquids, as fast as they overflow
the basins, or are passed through the
chemical works, are conducted into the public
sewers, and through them into the Seine,
nearly opposite the Jardin des Plantes. <i>They
thus fall into the river at the very commencement
of its course through Paris, and pollute its
waters before they have reached the various
works lower down and near the centre of the
city, where they are raised and distributed for
household purposes, for the supply of baths, and
for the public fountains.</i></p>

<p>“Rats are found by thousands in the Voirie,
and their voracity is such, that I have often
known them, during a single night, convert
into skeletons the carcasses of twenty horses
which had been brought thither the evening
before. The bones are burnt to heat the
coppers, or to get rid of them.</p>

<p>“Speaking of the disgusting practices at the
Voirie, Mr. Gisquet says, ‘I have seen men
stark naked, passing entire days in the midst
of the basins, seeking for any objects of value
they might contain. I have seen others fishing
for the rotten fish the market inspectors
had caused to be thrown into the basins. Two
cartloads of spoilt and stinking mackerel were
thrown into the largest of the basins; two
hours afterwards all the fish had disappeared.’</p>

<p>“The emanations from the Voirie are, as
may well be supposed, most powerfully offensive.
To a stranger unaccustomed to the
atmosphere surrounding them it would be
almost impossible to make the tour of the
basins without being more or less affected
with a disposition to nausea. Large and numerous
bubbles of gas are seen constantly
rising from a lake of urine and water, while
evaporation of the most foul description is
going on from many acres of surrounding
ground, upon which the solid matter is spread
to dry.”</p>

<p>The late M. Parent du Châtelet, a high
authority on this matter, stated (in 1833)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
that the emanations from the Voirie were insupportable
within a circumference of 2000
mètres (about a mile and a quarter, English
measure); while the winds carried them
sometimes, as was shown when an official
inquiry was made as to the ravages and causes
of cholera, 2&frac12; miles; and in certain states of
the atmosphere, 8 French miles (not quite
5 English miles). The same high authority
has also stated, that in addition to the emanations
from the cesspool matter at the Voirie the
greater part of the carcasses of about 12,000
horses, and between 25,000 and 30,000 smaller
animals, were allowed to rot upon the ground
there.</p>

<p>To abate this nuisance a new Voirie was,
more than 20 years since, formed in the
forest of Bondy, 8 miles from Paris. It consists
of eight basins, four on each side of the
Canal de l’Ourcq, arranged like those at Montfaucon.
The area of these basins is little
short of 96,000 square yards, and their collective
capacity upwards of 261,000 cubic
yards. The expectations of the relief that
would be experienced from the establishment
of the new Voirie in the forest have not been
realized. The movable cesspools only have
been conveyed there, by boats on the canal,
to be emptied; the empty casks being conveyed
back by the same boats. The basins
are not yet full; for the conveyance by the
Canal de l’Ourcq is costly, and in winter its
traffic is sometimes suspended by its being
frozen. In one year the cost of conveying
these movable cesspools to Bondy was little
short of 1500<i>l.</i></p>

<p>In the latest Report on this subject (1835)
the Commissioners, of whom M. Parent du
Châtelet was one, recommend that all the
cesspool matter at the Voiries should be disinfected.
M. Salmon, after a course of chemical
experiments (the Report of the Commission
states), disinfected and carbonized a
mass of mud and filth, containing much
organic matter, deposited (from a sewer) on
the banks of the Seine.</p>

<p>The Commissioners say, “The discovery of
M. Salmon awakened the attention of the
contractors of Montfaucon, who employed one
of our most skilful chemists to find for them
a means of disinfection other than that for
which M. Salmon had taken out a patent.
M. Sanson and some other persons made
similar researches, and from their joint investigations
it resulted that disinfection might
be equally well produced with turf ashes, with
carbonized turf, and with the simple <i>débris</i>
of this very abundant substance; and that
the same success might be obtained with saw-dust,
with the refuse matter of the tan-yards,
with garden mould, so abundant in the environs
of Paris, and with many other substances.
A curious experiment has even
shown, that after mixing with a clayey earth
a portion of fæcal matter, it was only necessary
to carbonize this mixture to obtain a
perfect disinfectant powder. Theory had already
indicated the result.”</p>

<p>This disinfection, however, has not been
carried out in the Voiries, nor in the manufacture
of poudrette.</p>

<p>From the account of the general refuse
depositories of Paris we pass to the particular
receptacles or cesspools of the French capital.</p>

<p>The Parisian cesspools are of two <span class="lock">sorts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Fixed or excavated cesspools.</p>

<p>2. Movable cesspools.</p>

<p>“In early times the <i>excavated cesspools</i> or
pits were constructed in the rudest manner,
and cleaned out more or less frequently, or
utterly neglected, at the discretion of their
owners. As the city increased in size, however,
and as the permeations necessarily
taking place into the soil accumulated in the
lapse of centuries, the evil resulting was found
to be of grave magnitude, calling for prompt
and vigorous interference on the part of the
authorities. It appears certain that prior to
the year 1819 (when a strict <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ordonnance</i>
was issued on the subject) the cesspools were
very carelessly constructed. For the most
part they were far from water-tight, and very
probably were not intended to be otherwise.
Consequently, nearly the whole of the fluid
matter within them drained into the springs
beneath the substratum, or became absorbed
by the surrounding soil. Nor was this the
only evil: the basement walls of the houses
became saturated with the offensive permeations,
and the atmosphere, more particularly
in the interior of the dwellings, tainted with
their exhalations.</p>

<p>“The <i>movable cesspools</i>, for the most part,
consist simply of tanks or barrels, which, when
full, are removed to some convenient spot for
the purpose of their contents being discharged.
This form of cesspool, though not leading to
that contamination of the substratum which
is naturally induced by the fixed or excavated
cesspool, may occasion many offensive nuisances
from carelessness in overfilling, or in
the process of emptying.”</p>

<p>“The movable cesspools are of two kinds;
the one,” says Mr. Rammell, “extremely simple
and primitive in construction, the other
more complicated. The former retains all the
refuse, both liquid and solid, passed into it;
the latter retains only the solid matter, the
liquid being separated by a sort of strainer,
and running off into another receptacle.</p>

<p>“The advantage of this separating apparatus
is, that those cesspools provided with
it require to be emptied less frequently than
the others; the solid matter being alone
retained in the movable part. The liquid
portion is withdrawn from the tank into which
it is received by pumping.</p>

<p>“The other kind of movable cesspool consists
simply of a wooden cask set on end, and
having its top pierced to admit the soil-pipe.
It is intended to retain both solid and liquid
matter. When full, it is detached, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
aperture in the top having been closed by a
tight-fitting lid secured by an iron bar placed
across, it is removed, and an empty one immediately
substituted for it.</p>

<p>“The movable cesspool last described is
much more generally used than the other kind;
very few are furnished with the separating apparatus.
But the use of either sort, I am told,
is not on the increase. The movable cesspools
are found, on the whole, to be more
expensive than the fixed, besides entailing
many inconveniences, one of which is the
frequent entrance of workmen upon the premises
for the purpose of removing them, which
sometimes has to be done every second or
third day. Moreover, if the cask becomes in
the slightest degree overcharged, there is an
overflow of matter.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the movable system of cesspools
(it appears from further accounts) seems to
be now adopted only in those places where
fixed cesspools could not be altered in accordance
with the ordonnance, or where it
is desired to avoid the first cost of a fixed
cesspool.</p>

<p>An ordonnance of 1819 enacts peremptorily
that <i>all</i> cesspools, fixed or excavated, then
existing, shall be altered in accordance with its
provisions upon the first subsequent emptying
after the date of the enactment, “or if that be
found impracticable, they shall be filled up.”
This full delegation of power to a centralised
authority was the example prompting our
late stringent enactments as to buildings and
sewerage.</p>

<p>The French ordonnance provides also that
the walls, arches, and bottoms of the cesspools,
shall be constructed of a very hard description
of stone, known as “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pierres meulières</span>” (mill-stone);
the mortar used is to be hydraulic
lime and clean river sand. Each arch is to be
30 to 35 centimètres (12 to 14 inches) in
thickness, and the walls 45 to 50 centimètres
(18 to 20 inches); the interior height not to
be less than 2 mètres (2 yards 6 inches).
A soil-pipe is always to be placed in the
middle of the cesspool; its interior diameter
is not to be less than 9⅞ inches in pottery-ware
piping, or 7⅞ inches in cast iron. A vent-pipe,
not less than 9⅞ inches in diameter, is to be
carried up to the level of the chimney-tops,
or to that of the chimneys of the adjoining
houses. This is, if possible, to divert the
smell from the house to which the cesspool
is attached.</p>

<p>“A principal object of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ordonnance</i>,” it is
stated in the Reports, “was to ensure the
cesspools being thenceforth made water-tight;
so that further pollution of the substratum
and springs might be prevented; and the
provisions for its attainment have been very
strictly enforced by the police. The present
cesspools are, in fact, water-tight constructions,
retaining the whole of the liquids passed into
them until the same are withdrawn by artificial
means. The advantage has its attendant inconveniences,
and, moreover, has been dearly
paid for; for, independently of the cost of the
alterations and the increased cost of making
the cesspools in the outset&mdash;the liquids no
longer draining away by natural permeation&mdash;the
constant expense of emptying them has
enormously increased. In the better class of
houses, where water is more freely used, the
operation has now to be repeated every three,
four, or five months, whereas formerly the
cesspool was emptied every eighteen months
or two years. An increased water supply has
added to the evil, moderate even now as the
extent of that supply is.”</p>

<p>“It is estimated that, in the better class of
houses, the daily quantity of matter, including
the water necessary for cleanliness and to
ensure the passage of the solids through the
soil-pipe, passing into the cesspool from each
individual, amounts to 1&frac34; litre (3·08 English
pints). Foreign substances are found in great
abundance in the cesspools; the large soil-pipes
permitting their easy introduction; so
that the cesspool becomes the common receptacle
for a great variety of articles that it is
desired secretly to get rid of. Article 19 of the
Police Regulations directs that nightmen finding
any articles in the cesspools, especially
such as lead to the suspicion of a crime or
misdemeanor, shall make a declaration of the
fact the same day to a Commissary of Police.”</p>

<p>In all such matters the police regulations of
France are far more stringent and exacting than
those of England.</p>

<p>“The cesspools vary considerably in foulness,”
continues the Report; “and <i>it is remarkable
that those containing the greatest proportion of
water are the most foul and dangerous</i>. This is
accounted for by the increased quantity of sulphuretted
hydrogen gas evolved: and is more
particularly the case where, from their large
size, or from the small number of people using
them, much time is allowed for the matter to
stagnate and decompose in them. Soap-suds
are said to add materially to their offensive
and dangerous condition. <i>The</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">FOULNESS</span> <i>of the
cesspools, therefore, would appear to be in direct
proportion to the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CLEANLY</span> <i>habits of the inmates
of the houses to which they respectively belong.</i>
Where urine predominates ammoniacal vapours
are given off in considerable quantities,
and although these affect the eyes of those exposed
to them&mdash;and the nightmen suffer much
from inflammation of these organs&mdash;no danger
to life results. The inflammation, however, is
often sufficiently acute to produce temporary
blindness, and from this cause the men are at
times thrown out of work for days together.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>emptying of the cesspools</i> is the next
point to be considered.</p>

<p>No cesspool is allowed to be emptied in Paris,
and no nightman’s cart, containing soil, is allowed
to be in the streets from 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to 10
<span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> from October 1st to March 31st, nor
from 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> from April 1st to September
30th. In the winter season the hours
of labour permitted by law are ten, and in the
summer season seven, out of the twenty-four;
while in London the hours of night-work are
limited to five, without any distinction of season.
These hours, however, only relate to the
cleansing of the fixed cesspools of Paris.</p>

<p>Fixed or excavated cesspools are emptied
into carts, which are driven to the receptacles.
As far as regards the removal of night-soil
along the streets, there are far more frequent
complaints of stench and annoyance in Paris
than in London. None of these cesspools can
be emptied without authority from the police,
and the police exercise a vigilant supervision
over the whole arrangements; neither can any
cesspool, after being emptied, be closed without
a written authority, after inspection, by the
Director of Health; nor can a cesspool, if
found defective when emptied, be repaired
without such authority.</p>

<p>“With regard to the movable cesspool,” it
is reported, “the process of emptying is very
simple, though undoubtedly demanding a considerable
expenditure of labour. The tank or
barrel, when filled, is disconnected from the
soil-pipe, an empty one being immediately substituted
in its place, and the bung-hole being
securely closed, it is conveyed away on a vehicle,
somewhat resembling a brewer’s dray (which
holds about eight or ten of them), to the spot
appointed as the depository of its discharged
contents. The removal of movable cesspools
is allowed to take place during the day.”</p>

<p>In opening a cesspool in Paris, precautions
are always taken to prevent accidents which
might result from the escape or ignition of the
gases.</p>

<p>The general, not to say universal, mode of
emptying the fixed or excavated cesspools is to
pump the contents into closed carts for transport.</p>

<p>“This operation is,” says Mr. Rammell,
“performed with two descriptions of pumps, one
working on what may be called the <i>hydraulic</i>
principle, the other on the <i>pneumatic</i>. In the
former, the valves are placed in the pipe communicating
between the cesspool and the cart,
and the matter itself is pumped. In the latter,
the valves are placed beyond the cart, and the
air being pumped out of the cart, the matter
flows into it to fill up the vacuum so occasioned.
The real principle is of course the
same in both cases, the matter being forced up
by atmospheric pressure. One advantage of
the pneumatic system is, that there are no
valves to impede the free passage of matter
through the suction-pipe; another, that it permits
the use of a pipe of larger diameter.</p>

<p>“The cart employed for the pneumatic system
consists of an iron cylinder, mounted
sometimes upon four, but generally upon two
wheels, the latter arrangement being found to
be the more convenient. Previous to use at
the cesspool, the carts are drawn to a branch
establishment, situate just within the Barrière
du Combat, where they are exhausted of air
with an air-pump, worked by steam power. A
12-horse engine erected there is capable of exhausting
five carts at the same time; the vacuum
produced being equal to 28⅜ inches (72 centimètres)
of mercury. A cart (in good repair,
and upon two wheels) will preserve a practical
vacuum for 48 hours after exhaustion.”</p>

<p>The total weight of one of these carts when
full is about 3 tons and 8 cwt. This is somewhat
more than the weight of the contents of
a London waggon employed in night-soil carriage.
Three horses are attached to each cart.</p>

<p>When an opening into the cesspool has been
effected, a suction-pipe on the pneumatic principle
is laid from the cesspool to the cart.
This pipe is 3<span class="small"><sup>15</sup></span>/<span class="small"><sub class="small">16</sub></span> inches in diameter, and is in
separate pieces of about 10 feet each, with
others shorter (down even to 1 foot), to
make up any exact length required. Two
kinds are commonly used; one made of leather,
having iron wire wound spirally inside to prevent
collapse, the other of copper. The leather
pipe is used where a certain degree of pliability
is required; the copper for the straight
parts of the line, and for determined curves;
pieces struck from various radii being made
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Gutta-percha has been tried as a substitute
for leather in the piping, but was pronounced
liable to split, and its use was abandoned. So
with India-rubber in London.</p>

<p>The communication between the suction-pipe
and the vehicle used by the nightmen is
opened by withdrawing a plug by means of a
forked rod into the “recess” (hollow) of the
machine, an operation tasking the muscular
powers of two men. This done, the cesspool
contents rush into the cart, being forced
up by the weight of the atmosphere to occupy
the existing vacuum; this occupies about
three minutes. The cart, however, is then but
three-fourths filled with matter, the remaining
fourth being occupied by the rarefied air previously
in the cart, and by the air contained in
the suction-pipe. This air is next withdrawn
by the action of a small air-pump, worked usually
by two, but sometimes by one man. The
air-pump is placed on the ground at a little distance
from the cesspool cart, and communicates
with it by a flexible India-rubber tube, an
inch in diameter. The air, as fast as it is
pumped out, is forced through another India-rubber
tube of similar dimensions, which communicates
with a furnace, also placed on the
ground at a little distance from the air-pump,
the pump occupying the middle space between
the cart and the furnace, the furnace and the
pump being portable. To ascertain when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
vehicle is full, a short glass tube is inserted in
the end of the air-pipe (the end being of
brass), and through this, with the help of a
small lantern, the matter is seen to rise.</p>

<p>“The number of carts required for each
operation,” states Mr. Rammell, “of course varies
according to the size of the cesspool to be
emptied; but as these contain on the average
about five cartloads, that is the number usually
sent.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>“In addition to the carts for the transport
of the night-soil, a light-covered spring van
drawn by one horse is used to carry the tools,
&amp;c., required in the process.</p>

<p>“These tools consist <span class="lock">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“1. An air-pump when the work is to be
done on the pneumatic system, and of an hydraulic
pump when it is to be done on the
hydraulic system.</p>

<p>“2. About 50 mètres of suction-pipe of various
forms and lengths.</p>

<p>“3. A furnace for the purpose of burning
the gases.</p>

<p>“4. Wooden hods for the removal of the
solid night-soil.</p>

<p>“5. Pails, a ladder, pincers, levers, hammers,
and other articles.”</p>

<p>I have hitherto spoken of the <i>Pneumatic</i>
System of emptying the Parisian cesspools.
The results of the <i>Hydraulic</i> System are so
similar, as regards time, &amp;c., that only a brief
notice is required. The hydraulic pump is
worked by four men; it is placed on the ground
in the place most convenient for the operation,
and the cart is filled in the space of from three
to five minutes.</p>

<p>A furnace is used.</p>

<p>“The furnace,” says the Report, “consists
of a sheet-iron cylinder, about nine inches in
diameter, pierced with small holes, and covered
with a conical cap to prevent the flame spreading.
The vent-pipe first communicates underneath
with a small reservoir, intended to
contain the matter in case the operation
should be carried too far. A piece is inserted
in the bottom of this reservoir, by unscrewing
which it may be emptied. The furnace is
sometimes fixed upon a plank, which rests
upon two projecting pieces behind the cart.”</p>

<p>An indicator is also used to show the advancement
of the filling of the cart; a glass tube
and a cork float are the chief portions of the
apparatus of the indicator.</p>

<p>“Towards the end of the operation, when
the quantity of matter remaining in the cesspool,
although sufficiently fluid, is too shallow
for pumping, it is scooped into a large pail;
and, the end of the suction-pipe being introduced,
drawn up into the cart. When the
matter is in too solid a state to pass through
the pipe, it is carried to the cart in hods, unless
it is in considerable quantity. In that
case it is removed in vessels called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tinettes</i>,
in the shape of a truncated cone, holding
each about 3&frac12; cubic feet. These vessels are
closed with a lid, and are lifted into an open
waggon for transport.”</p>

<p>Of these two systems the pneumatic is the
more costly, and is likely to be supplanted by
the hydraulic. Each system, according to Mr.
Rammell, is still a nuisance, as, in spite of
every precaution, the gases escape the moment
the cesspool emptying is commenced, and
vitiate the atmosphere. They force their way
very often through the joints of the pipes, and
are insufficiently consumed in the furnaces.
Mr. Rammell mentions his having twice,
after witnessing two of these operations, suffered
from attacks of illness. On the first
occasion, the men omitted to burn the foul
air, and the atmosphere being heavy with
moisture, the odour was so intense that it was
smelt from the Rue du Port Mahon to the Rue
Menars, more than 400 yards distant.</p>

<p>The emptying of the cesspools is let by contract,
the commune acting in the light of a
proprietor. To obtain a contract, a man must
have license or permission from the prefect of
police, and such license is only granted after
proof that the applicant is provided with the
necessary apparatus, carts, &amp;c., and also with
a suitable dépôt for the reception of the
pumps, carts, &amp;c., when not in use. The
stock-in-trade of a contractor is inspected at
least twice a-year, and if found inadequate or
out of repair the license is commonly withdrawn.
The “gangs” of nightmen employed
by the contractors are fixed by the law at four
men each (the number employed in London),
but without any legal provision on the subject.
The terms of these contracts are not stated,
but they appear to have ceased to be undertakings
by individual capitalists, being all in
the hands of companies, known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compagnies
de vidanges</i> (filth companies). There are now
eight companies in Paris carrying on these
operations. More than half of the whole
work, however, is accomplished by one company,
the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnie Richer</i>.” The capital
invested in their working stock is said to exceed
4,800,000 francs (200,000<i>l.</i>). They now
require the labour of 350 horses, and the use
of 120 vehicles of different descriptions.</p>

<p>The construction of a cesspool in Paris costs
about 18<i>l.</i> as an average. The houses containing
from 30 to 70 inmates may have two,
and occasionally more, cesspools. Taking the
average at one and a half, the capital sunk in a
cesspool is 27<i>l.</i> Mr. Rammell <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Adopting these calculations of the number
of cesspools to each house, and their cost, and
allowing only the small quantity of 1&frac34; litre (3·08<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
pints) of matter to each individual, the annual
expense of the cesspool system in Paris, per
house containing 24 persons, will be,&mdash;</p>

<p>“For interest, at 5 per cent upon capital
sunk in works of construction, 1<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“For extraction and removal of matter,
5<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“Total, 6<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“The annual expense per inhabitant will be
5<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>“The latter, then, may be taken as the
average yearly sum per head actually paid by
that portion of the inhabitants of Paris who
use the cesspools.”</p>

<p>The following, among others before shown,
are the conclusions arrived at by Mr. <span class="lock">Rammell:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. “That with the most perfect regulations,
and the application of machines constructed
upon scientific principles, the operation of
emptying cesspools is still a nuisance, not only
to the inmates of the house to which it belongs,
but to those of the neighbouring houses, and
to persons passing in the street.</p>

<p>2. “That the cesspool system of Paris presents
an obstacle to the proper extension of
the water supply, and consequently represses
the growth of habits of personal and domestic
cleanliness, with their immense moral results;
and that in this respect it may be said to be
inconsistent with a high degree of civilization
of the masses of any community.</p>

<p>3. “That, compared with a tubular system of
refuse drainage, it is an exceedingly expensive
mode of disposing of the fæcal refuse of a town.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Emptying of the London Cesspools
by Pump and Hose.</span></h3>

<p>Having now ascertained the quantity of wet
house-refuse annually deposited in the cesspools
of the metropolis, the next step is to
show the means by which these 15,000,000
cubic feet of cesspoolage are removed, and
whence they are conveyed, as well as the condition
of the labourers engaged in the business.</p>

<p>There are two methods of removing the soil
from the <span class="lock">tanks:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. By pump and hose, or the hydraulic
method;</p>

<p>2. By shovel and tube, or manual labour.</p>

<p>The first of these is the new French mode,
and the other the old English method of performing
the work. The distinctive feature between
the two is, that in the one case the refuse
is discharged by means of pipes into the sewers,
and in the other that it is conveyed by means
of carts to some distant night-yard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Diagram of the</span></p>

<p>MODE OF CLEANSING CESSPOOLS BY PUMP AND HOSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>According to the French method, therefore,
the cesspoolage ultimately becomes sewage, the
refuse being deposited in a cesspool for a greater
or a less space of time, and finally discharged
into the sewers; so that it is a kind of intermediate
process between the cesspool system
and the sewer system of defecating a town,
being, as it were, a compound of the two.</p>

<p>The great advantage of the sewer system, as
contradistinguished from the cesspool system
of defecation, is, that it admits of the wet refuse
being removed from the neighbourhood of the
house as soon as it is produced; while the advantage
of the cesspool system, as contradistinguished
from the sewer system, is, that it
prevents the contamination of the river whence
the town draws its principal supply of water.
The cesspool system of defecation remedies
the main evil of the sewer system, and the
sewer system the main evil of the cesspool
system. The French mode of emptying cesspools,
however, appears to have the peculiar
property of combining the ill effects of both
systems without the advantages of either. The
refuse of the house not only remains rotting
and seething for months under the noses of the
household, but it is ultimately&mdash;that is, after
more than a year’s decomposition&mdash;washed into
the stream from which the inhabitants are supplied
with water, and so returned to them diluted
in the form of <i>aqua pura</i>, for washing,
cooking, or drinking. The sole benefit accruing
from the French mode of nightmanship is,
that it performs a noisome operation in a comparatively
cleanly manner; but surely this is a
small compensation for the evils attendant upon
it. The noses of those who prefer stagnant cesspools
to rapid sewers cannot be so particularly
sensitive, that for the sake of avoiding the smell
of the nightman’s cart they would rather that
its contents should be discharged into the
water that they use for household purposes.</p>

<p>The hydraulic or pump-and-hose method of
emptying the cesspools is now practised by the
Court of Sewers, who introduced the process
into London in the winter of 1847. The apparatus
used in this country consists of an
hydraulic pump, which is generally placed six
or eight feet distant from, but sometimes close
to, the cesspool&mdash;indeed, on its edge. It is
worked by two men, “just up and down,” as
one of the labourers described it to me, “like a
fire-engine.” A suction-pipe, with an iron
nozzle, is placed in the cesspool, into which is
first introduced a deodorising fluid, in the proportion,
as well as can be estimated, of a pint
to a square yard of matter, and diluted with
water from the fire-plugs.</p>

<p>The pipes are of leather, the suction-pipes
being wrapped with spring-iron wire at the
joints. India-rubber pipes were used, and
“answered very tidy,” one of the gangers told
me, but they were too expensive, the material
being soon worn out: they were only tried five
or six months. The pipes now employed differ
in no respect of size or appearance from the
leathern fire-engine pipes; and as the work is
always done in the daytime, and no smell arises
from it, the neighbourhood is often alarmed, and
people begin to ask where the fire is. One outsideman
said, “Why, that’s always asked. I’ve
been asked&mdash;ay, I dare say a hundred times
in a day&mdash;‘Where’s the fire? where’s the
fire?’” A cesspool, by this process, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
emptied into a sewer at 300 yards distant.
The pipe is placed within the nearest gullyhole,
down which the matter is washed into the
sewer. When the cesspool is emptied, it is
well sluiced with water; the water is pumped
into the sewer, and then the work is complete.</p>

<p>The pumping is occasionally very hard work,
making the shoulders and back ache grievously;
indeed, some cesspools have been found so long
neglected, and so choked with rags and rubbish,
that manual labour had to be resorted to,
and the matter dug and tubbed out, after the
old mode of the nightmen. A square yard of
cesspoolage is cleared out, under ordinary circumstances,
in an hour; while an average duration
of time for the cleansing of a regularly-sized
cesspool is from three to four hours.</p>

<p>A pneumatic pump, with an iron cart, drawn
by two horses (similar to the French invention),
was tried as an experiment, but discontinued
in a fortnight.</p>

<p>For the hydraulic method of emptying cesspools,
a gang of four men, under the direction
of a ganger, who makes a fifth, is required.</p>

<p>The <i>division of labour</i> is as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The pumpmen, who, as their name implies,
work the engine or pumps.</p>

<p>2. The holeman, who goes into the cesspool
and stirs up the matter, so as to make it as fluid
as possible.</p>

<p>3. The outsideman, whose business it is to
attend to the pipe, which reaches from the cesspool,
along the surface of the street, or other
place, to the gullyhole.</p>

<p>4. The ganger, who is the superintendent
of the whole, and is only sometimes present at
the operation; he is not unfrequently engaged,
while one cesspool is being emptied, in making
an examination or any necessary arrangement
for the opening of another. He also gives
notice (acting under the instruction of the clerk
of the works) to the water company of the district,
that the pumps will be at work in this or
that place, a notice generally given a day in
advance, and the water is supplied gratuitously,
from a street fire-plug, and used at discretion,
some cesspool contents requiring three times
more water than others to liquefy them sufficient
for pumping.</p>

<p>The cesspool-pumping gangs are six in number,
each consisting of five men, although the
“outsideman” is sometimes a strong youth of
seventeen or eighteen. The whole work is
done by a contractor, who makes an agreement
with the Court of Sewers, and finds the
necessary apparatus, appointing his own labourers.
All the present labourers, however,
have been selected as trusty men from among
the flushermen, the contractor concurring in
the recommendation of the clerk of the works,
or the inspector. The cesspool-sewermen work
in six districts. Two divisions (east and west)
of Westminster; Finsbury and Holborn;
Surrey and Kent; Tower Hamlets (now including
Poplar); and the City. The districts
vary in size, but there is usually a gang devoted
to each: in case of emergency, however, a
gang from another district (as among the
flushermen) is sent to expedite any pressing
work. All the men are paid by the job, the
payment being 2<i>s.</i> each per job, to the pumpmen
and holeman, and 3<i>s.</i> to the ganger;
but in addition to the 2<i>s.</i> per job, the holeman
has 6<i>d.</i> a-day extra; and the outsideman has
6<i>d.</i> a-day <i>deducted</i> from the 4<i>s.</i> he would earn
in two jobs, which is a frequent day’s work.
The men told me that they had four or four and
a-half days’ work (or eight or nine jobs) every
week; but such was the case more particularly
when the householders were less cognizant
of the work, and did not think of
resorting to it; now, I am assured, the men’s
average employment may be put at five days
a week, or ten jobs.</p>

<p>The perquisites of these workmen are none,
except the householder sends them some refreshment
on his own accord. There may be
a perquisite, but very rarely, occurring to the
holeman, should he find anything in the soil;
but the finding is far less common than among
the nightmen, with whom the process goes
through different stages. I did not hear among
cesspool-sewermen of anything being found
by them or by their comrades; of course, when
the soil is once absorbed into the pipe, it is
unseen on its course of deposit down the
gullyhole.</p>

<p>The men have no trade societies, and no
arrangements of any equivalent nature; no
benefit clubs or sick clubs, for which their
number, indeed, is too small; or, as my informant
sometimes wound up in a climax,
“No, nothing that way, sir.” They are sober
and industrious men, chiefly married, and with
families. Into further statistics, however, of
diet, rent, &amp;c., I need not enter, concerning so
small a body; they are the same as among
other well-conducted labourers.</p>

<p>The men find their own dresses, which are
of the same cost, form, and material as I have
described to pertain to the flushermen; also
their own “picks” and shovels, costing respectively
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p>One cesspool-sewerman told me, that when
he was first a member of one of those gangs he
was “awful abused” by the “regular nightmen,”
if he came across any of them “as was
beery, poor fellows;” but that had all passed
over now.</p>

<p>The total sum paid to the six gangs of labourers
in the course of the year would, at the
rate of ten cesspools emptied per week, amount
to the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>During the year 1851, I am credibly informed
that as many as 3000 sewers were
emptied by the hydraulic process; and calculating
each to have contained the average
quantity of refuse, viz. five tons or loads, or
about 180 cubic feet, we have an aggregate of
540,000 cubic feet of cesspoolage ultimately
carried off by the sewers. This, however, is
only a twenty-seventh of the entire quantity.</p>

<p>The sum paid in wages to the men engaged
in emptying these 3000 cesspools by the hydraulic
process would, at the rate of 2<i>s.</i> per
man to the four members of the gang, and
3<i>s.</i> to the ganger, or 11<i>s.</i> in all for each cesspool,
amount to 1650<i>l.</i>, which is 139<i>l.</i> and 250
cesspools less than the amount above given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement of a Cesspool-Sewerman.</span></h3>

<p>I give the following brief and characteristic
statement, which is peculiar in showing the
habitual <i>restlessness</i> of the mere labourer. My
informant was a stout, hale-looking man, who
had rarely known illness. All these sort of
labourers (nightmen included) scout the notion
of the cholera attacking <i>them!</i></p>

<p>“Work, sir? Well, I think I <i>do</i> know what
work is, and has known it since I was a child;
and then I was set to help at the weaving. My
friends were weavers at Norwich, and 26 years
ago, until steam pulled working men down from
being well paid and well off, it was a capital
trade. Why, my father could sometimes earn
3<i>l.</i> at his work as a working weaver; there was
money for ever then; now 12<i>s.</i> a-week is, I believe,
the tip-top earnings of his trade. But
<i>I didn’t like the confinement or the close air in
the factories</i>, and so, when I grew big enough,
I went to ground-work in the city (so he frequently
called Norwich); I call ground-work
such as digging drains and the like. Then
I ’listed into the Marines. <i>Oh, I hardly know
what made me</i>; men does foolish things and
don’t know why; it’s human natur. I’m sure
it wasn’t the bounty of 3<i>l.</i> that tempted me,
for I was doing middling, and sometimes had
night-work as well as ground-work to do.
I was then sent to Sheerness and put on
board the <i>Thunderer</i> man-of-war, carrying 84
guns, as a marine. She sailed through the
Straits (of Gibraltar), and was three years
and three months blockading the Dardanelles,
and cruising among the islands. I never saw
anything like such fortifications as at the Dardanelles;
why, there was mortars there as
would throw a ton weight. No, I never heard
of their having been fired. Yes, we sometimes
got leave for a party to go ashore on
one of the islands. They called them Greek
islands, but I fancy as how it was Turks near
the Dardanelles. O yes, the men on the
islands was civil enough to us; they never
spoke to us, and we never spoke to them.
The sailors sometimes, and indeed the lot of
us, would have bits of larks with them, laughing
at ’em and taking sights at ’em and such
like. Why, I’ve seen a fine-dressed Turk,
one of their grand gentlemen there, when
a couple of sailors has each been taking a
sight at him, and dancing the shuffle along
with it, make each on ’em a low bow, as solemn
as could be. Perhaps he thought it was a way
of being civil in our country! I’ve seen some
of the head ones stuck over with so many
knives, and cutlasses, and belts, and pistols,
and things, that he looked like a cutler’s shop-window.
We were ordered home at last, and
after being some months in barracks, which
I didn’t relish at all, were paid off at Plymouth.
Oh, a barrack life’s anything but pleasant, but
I’ve done with it. After that I was eight years
and a quarter a gentleman’s servant, coachman,
or anything (in Norwich), and then got
tired of that and came to London, and got to
ground and new sewer-work, and have been on
the sewers above five years. Yes, I prefer the
sewers to the Greek islands. I was one of the
first set as worked a pump. There was a great
many spectators; I dare say as there was 40
skientific gentlemen. I’ve been on the sewers,
flushing and pumping, ever since. The houses
we clean out, all says it’s far the best plan,
ours is. ‘Never no more nightmen,’ they say.
You see, sir, our plan’s far less trouble to the
people in the house, and there’s no smell&mdash;least
I never found no smell, and it’s cheap,
too. In time the nightmen’ll disappear; in
course they must, there’s so many new dodges
comes up, always some one of the working
classes is a being ruined. If it ain’t steam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
it’s something else as knocks the bread out of
their mouths quite as quick.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Present Disposal of the Night-Soil.</span></h3>

<p>It would appear, according to the previous calculations,
that of the 15,000,000 cubic feet of
house-refuse annually deposited in the cesspools
of the metropolis, about 500,000 cubic
feet are pumped by the French process into
the sewers; consequently there still remains
about 14,500,000 cubic feet, or about 404,000
loads, to be disposed of by other means. I shall
now proceed to explain how the cesspoolage
proper, that is to say, that which is removed
by cartage rather than by being discharged
into the sewers, is ultimately got rid of.</p>

<p>Until about twenty months ago, when the
new sanitary regulations concerning the disposal
of night-soil came into operation, the
cesspool matter was “shot” in a night-yard,
generally also a dust-yard. These were the
yards of the parish contractors, and were
situate in Maiden-lane, Paddington, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Any sweeper-nightman, or any nightman, was
permitted by the proprietor of one of these
places to deposit his night-soil there. For
this the depositor received no payment, the
privilege of having “a shoot” being accounted
sufficient.</p>

<p>There were, till within these six or eight
years, I was informed, 60 places where cesspool
manure could be shot. These included
the nightmen’s yards and the wharves of manure
dealers (some of the small coasting vessels
taking it as ballast); but as regards the cesspool
filth, there are now none of these places
of deposit, though some little, I was told, might
be done by stealth.</p>

<p>Of one of these night-yard factories Dr. Gavin
gave, in 1848, the following <span class="lock">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“On the western side of Spitalfields workhouse,
and entering from a street called Queen-street,
is a nightman’s yard. A heap of dung
and refuse of every description, about the size
of a tolerably large house, lies piled to the left
of the yard; to the right is an artificial pond,
into which the contents of cesspools are thrown.
The contents are allowed to desiccate in the
open air; and they are frequently stirred for
that purpose. The odour which was given off
when the contents were raked up, to give me
an assurance that there was nothing so very
bad in the alleged nuisance, drove me from
the place with the utmost speed.</p>

<p>“On two sides of this horrid collection of
excremental matter was a patent manure manufactory.
To the right in this yard was a large
accumulation of dung, &amp;c., but to the left there
was an extensive layer of a compost of blood,
ashes, and nitric acid, which gave out the
most horrid, offensive, and disgusting concentration
of putrescent odours it has ever
been my lot to be the victim of. The whole
place presented a most foul and filthy aspect,
and an example of the enormous outrages
which are perpetrated in London against
society.</p>

<p>“It is a curious fact, that the parties who
had charge of these two premises were each
dead to the foulness of their own most pestilential
nuisances. The nightman’s servant
accused the premises of the manure manufacturer
as the source of perpetual foul smells,
but thought his yard free from any particular
cause of complaint; while the servant of the
patent manure manufacturer diligently and
earnestly asserted the perfect freedom of his
master’s yard from foul exhalations; but
considered that the raking up of the drying
night-soil on the other side of the wall was
‘quite awful, and enough to kill anybody.’</p>

<p>“Immediately adjoining the patent manure
manufactory is the establishment of a
bottle merchant. He complained to me in
the strongest terms of the expenses and
annoyances he had been put to through the
emanations which floated in the atmosphere
having caused his bottles to spoil the wine
which was placed in such as had not been
<i>very</i> recently washed. He was compelled frequently
to change his straw, and frequently to
wash his bottles, and considered that unless
the nuisance could be suppressed, he would
be compelled to leave his present premises.”</p>

<p>This and similar places were suppressed
soon after the passing of the sanitary measures
of September, 1848.</p>

<p>The cesspool refuse, which was disposed of
for manure, was at that time first shot into
recesses in the night-yard, where it was mixed
with exhausted hops procured from the brewhouses,
which were said to absorb the liquid
portions, when stirred up with the matter, and
to add not only to the consistency of the mass,
but to its readier portability for land manure
or for stowage in a barge. It was also mixed
with littered straw from the mews, and with
stable manure generally. An old man who
had worked many years&mdash;he did not know how
many&mdash;in one of these yards, told me that
when this night-soil was “fresh shot and first
mixed” (with the hops, &amp;c.), the stench was
often dreadful. “How we stood it,” he said,
“I don’t know; but we did stand it.”</p>

<p>In one of the night-and-dust-yards, I ascertained
that as many as 50 loads, half of them
waggon-loads, have been shot from the proprietor’s
own carts, and from the carts of the
nightmen “using” the yard, in one morning,
but the average “shoot” was about ten loads
(half a waggon) a-day for six days in the week.</p>

<p>Of the mode of manufacture of this manure,
a full account has been given in the details of
the cesspool system of Paris, for the process
was the same in London, although on a much
smaller scale; and indeed the manufacture
here was chiefly in the hands of Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The manure was, after it had been deposited
for periods varying from one month to five or
six, sold to farmers and gardeners at from
4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> the cart-load, although 4<i>s.</i>, I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>formed,
might have been the general average.
The cesspool matter, considered <i>per se</i>, was
not worth, of late years, I am told, above 2<i>s.</i>
a ton (or a load, which is sometimes rather
more and sometimes less than a ton). It
was when mixed that the price was 4<i>s.</i> to
5<i>s.</i> a ton. This cesspool filth was shot on the
premises of the manufacturer gratuitously, as
it was in any of the night-yards. It was not
until it had been kept some time, and had
been mixed (generally) with other manures,
and sometimes with road-sweepings, that this
manure was used in gardens; for it was said
that if this had not been done, its ammoniacal
vapours would have been absorbed and retained
by the leaves of the fruit-trees.</p>

<p>This night-soil manure was devoted to two
purposes&mdash;to the manufacture of deodorized
and portable manure for exportation (chiefly
to our sugar-growing colonies), and to the
fertilization of the land around London.</p>

<p>When manufactured into manure it was
shipped&mdash;in new casks generally, the manure
casks of the outward voyage being transformed
into the brown sugar casks of the homeward-bound
vessels. I was told by a seaman
who some years ago sailed to the West Indies,
that these manure casks in damp weather
gave out an unpleasant odour.</p>

<p>It was only to the home cultivators who resided
at no great distance from a night-yard,
from five to six miles or a little more, that
this manure was sold to be carted away; their
attendance at the markets with carts, waggons,
and horses, giving them facilities of conveying
the manure at a cheap rate. But upwards of
three-fourths of the whole was sent in barges
into the more distant country parts, having a
ready water communication either by the
Thames or by canal.</p>

<p>The purchaser nearer home conveyed it
away in his own cart, and with his own horses,
which had perhaps come up to town laden with
cabbages to Covent Garden, or hay to Cumberland-market,
the cart being made water-tight
for the purpose. The “legal hours” to
be observed in the cleansing of cesspools, and
the transport of the contents upon such
cleansing, not being required to be observed in
this second transport of the cesspool manure,
it was carted away at any hour, as stable dung
now is.</p>

<p>It is not possible at the present time, when
night-yards are no longer permitted to exist in
London, and the manufacture of the night-soil
manure is consequently suppressed, to ascertain
the precise quantities disposed of commercially,
in a former state of things.</p>

<p>The money returns to the master-nightman
for the manure he now collects need no
figures. The law requires him to refrain from
shooting this soil in his own yard, or in <i>any</i>
inhabited part of the metropolis, and it is shot
on the nearest farm to which he has access,
merely for the privilege of shooting it, the
farmer paying nothing for the deposit, with
which he does what he pleases. It is mixed
with other refuse, I was told, at present, and
kept as compost, or used on the land, but the
change is too recent for the establishment of
any systematic traffic in the article.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Of the Working Nightmen and the
Mode of Work.</span></h3>

<p>Nightwork, by the provisions of the Police
Act, is not to be commenced before twelve at
night, nor continued beyond five in the morning,
winter and summer alike. This regulation
is known among the nightmen as the “legal
hours,” and tends, in a measure, to account
for the heterogeneous class of labourers who
still seek nightwork; for strong men think
little of devoting a part of the night, as well as
the working hours of the day, to toil. A rubbish-carter,
a very powerfully-built man, told
me he was partial to nightwork, and always
looked out for it, even when in daily employ,
as “it was sometimes like found money.” The
scavengers, sweeps, dustmen, and labourers
known as ground-workers, are anxious to
obtain night-work when out of regular employment;
and, ten years and more since, it
was often an available and remunerative resource.</p>

<p>Night-work is, then, essentially, and perhaps
necessarily, extra-work, rather than a distinct
calling followed by a separate class of workers.
The generality of nightmen are scavengers, or
dustmen, or chimney-sweepers, or rubbish-carters,
or pipe-layers, or ground-workers, or
coal-porters, carmen or stablemen, or men
working for the market-gardeners round London&mdash;all
either in or out of employment. Perhaps
there is not at the present time in the
whole metropolis a working nightman who is
<i>solely</i> a working nightman.</p>

<p>It is almost the same with the master-nightmen.
They are generally master-chimney-sweepers,
scavengers, rubbish-carters, and
builders. Some of the contractors for the public
street scavengery, and the house-dust-bin
emptying, are (or have been) among the largest
employers of nightmen, but only in their individual
trading capacity, for they have no contracts
with the parishes concerning the emptying of
cesspools; indeed the parish or district corporations
have nothing to do with the matter. I
have already shown, that among the best-patronised
master-nightmen are now the
Commissioners of the Court of Sewers.</p>

<p>For how long a period the master and working
chimney-sweepers and scavengers have
been the master and labouring nightmen I am
unable to discover, but it may be reasonable to
assume that this connexion, as a matter of
trade, existed in the metropolis at the commencement
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The police of Paris, as I have shown, have full
control over cesspool cleansing, but the police
of London are instructed merely to prevent
night-work being carried on at a later or earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
period than “the legal hours;” still a few minutes
either way are not regarded, and the legal
hours, I am told, are almost always adhered to.</p>

<p>Nightwork is carried on&mdash;and has been so
carried on, within the memory of the oldest men
in the trade, who had never heard their predecessors
speak of any other system&mdash;after this
method:&mdash;A gang of four men (exclusive of
those who have the care of the horses, and who
drive the night-carts to and from the scenes of
the men’s labours at the cesspools) are set to
work. The labour of the gang is divided,
though not with any individual or especial
strictness, as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The <i>holeman</i>, who goes into the cesspool
and fills the tub.</p>

<p>2. The <i>ropeman</i>, who raises the tub when
filled.</p>

<p>3. The <i>tubmen</i> (of whom there are two), who
carry away the tub when raised, and empty it
into the cart.</p>

<p>The mode of work may be thus briefly described:&mdash;Within
a foot, or even less sometimes,
though often as much as three feet, below
the surface of the ground (when the cesspool is
away from the house) is what is called the “main
hole.” This is the opening of the cesspool, and
is covered with flag stones, removable, wholly or
partially, by means of the pickaxe. If the cesspool
be immediately under the privy, the flooring,
&amp;c., is displaced. Should the soil be near
enough to the surface, the tub is dipped into it,
drawn out, the filth scraped from its exterior
with a shovel, or swept off with a besom, or
washed off by water flung against it with sufficient
force. This done, the tubmen insert the
pole through the handles of the tub, and bear
it on their shoulders to the cart. The mode of
carriage and the form of the tub have been
already shown in an illustration, which I was
assured by a nightman who had seen it in a
shopwindow (for he could not read), was “as
nat’ral as life, tub and all.”</p>

<p>Thus far, the ropeman and the holeman generally
aid in filling the tub, but as the soil becomes
lower, the vessel is let down and drawn up full
by the ropeman. When the soil becomes lower
still, a ladder is usually planted inside the cesspool;
the “holeman,” who is generally the
strongest person in the gang, descends, shovels
the tub full, having stirred up the refuse to
loosen it, and the contents, being drawn up by
the ropeman, are carried away as before described.</p>

<p>The labour is sometimes severe. The tub
when filled, though it is never quite filled, weighs
rarely less than eight stone, and sometimes
more; “but that, you see, sir,” a nightman said
to me, “depends on the nature of the sile.”</p>

<p>Beer, and bread and cheese, are given to the
nightmen, and frequently gin, while at their
work; but as the bestowal of the spirit is voluntary,
some householders from motives of economy,
or from being real or pretended members
or admirers of the total-abstinence principles,
refuse to give any strong liquor, and in that
case&mdash;if such a determination to withhold the
drink be known beforehand&mdash;the employers
sometimes supply the men with a glass or two;
and the men, when “nothing better can be
done,” club their own money, and send to some
night-house, often at a distance, to purchase
a small quantity on their own account. One
master-nightman said, he thought his men
worked best, indeed he was sure of it, “with a
drop to keep them up;” another thought it did
them neither good nor harm, “in a moderate
way of taking it.” Both these informants were
themselves temperate men, one rarely tasting
spirits. It is commonly enough said, that if the
nightmen have no “allowance,” they will work
neither as quickly nor as carefully as if accorded
the customary gin “perquisite.” One man, certainly
a very strong active person, whose services
where quickness in the work was indispensable
might be valuable (and he had work as a rubbish-carter
also), told me that he for one would
not work for any man at nightwork if there was
not a fair allowance of drink, “to keep up his
strength,” and he knew others of the same mind.
On my asking him what he considered a “fair”
allowance, he told me that at least a bottle of gin
among the gang of four was “looked for, and
mostly had, over a gentleman’s cesspool. And
little enough, too,” the man said, “among four
of us; what it holds if it’s public-house gin is
uncertain: for you must know, sir, that some
bottles has great ‘kicks’ at their bottoms. But
I should say that there’s been a bottle of gin
drunk at the clearing of every two, ay, and more
than every two, out of three cesspools emptied
in London; and now that I come to think on
it, I should say that’s been the case with three
out of every four.”</p>

<p>Some master-nightmen, and more especially
the sweeper-nightmen, work at the cesspools
themselves, although many of them are men
“well to do in the world.” One master I met
with, who had the reputation of being “warm,”
spoke of his own manual labour in shovelling
filth in the same self-complacent tone that we
may imagine might be used by a grocer, worth
his “plum,” who quietly intimates that he will
serve a washerwoman with her half ounce of
tea, and weigh it for her himself, as politely as
he would serve a duchess; for <i>he</i> wasn’t above
his business: neither was the nightman.</p>

<p>On one occasion I went to see a gang of nightmen
at work. Large horn lanterns (for the night
was dark, though at intervals the stars shone
brilliantly) were placed at the edges of the cesspool.
Two poles also were temporarily fixed in
the ground, to which lanterns were hung, but
this is not always the case. The work went
rapidly on, with little noise and no confusion.</p>

<p>The scene was peculiar enough. The artificial
light, shining into the dark filthy-looking
cavern or cesspool, threw the adjacent houses
into a deep shade. All around was perfectly
still, and there was not an incident to interrupt
the labour, except that at one time the window
of a neighbouring house was thrown up, a night-capped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
head was protruded, and then down was
banged the sash with an impatient curse. It
appeared as if a gentleman’s slumbers had been
disturbed, though the nightmen laughed and
declared it was a lady’s voice! The smell, although
the air was frosty, was for some little
time, perhaps ten minutes, literally sickening;
after that period the chief sensation experienced
was a slight headache; the unpleasantness of
the odour still continuing, though without any
sickening effect. The nightmen, however, pronounced
the stench “nothing at all;” and one
even declared it was refreshing!</p>

<p>The cesspool in this case was so situated that
the cart or rather waggon could be placed about
three yards from its edge; sometimes, however,
the soil has to be carried through a garden and
through the house, to the excessive annoyance
of the inmates. The nightmen whom I saw
evidently enjoyed a bottle of gin, which had been
provided for them by the master of the house,
as well as some bread and cheese, and two pots
of beer. When the waggon was full, two horses
were brought from a stable on the premises
(an arrangement which can only be occasionally
carried out) and yoked to the vehicle, which
was at once driven away; a smaller cart and
one horse being used to carry off the residue.</p>

<p>Curious and ample as this Table of Refuse is&mdash;one,
moreover, perfectly original&mdash;it is not
sufficient, by the mere range of figures, to
convey to the mind of the reader a full comprehension
of the ramified vastness of the
Second-Hand trade of the metropolis. Indeed
tables are for reference more than for the
current information to be yielded by a history
or a narrative.</p>

<p>I will, therefore, offer a few explanations in
elucidation, as it were, of the tabular return.</p>

<p>I must, as indeed I have done in the accompanying
remarks, depart from the order of the
details of the table to point out, in the first
instance, the particulars of the greatest of the
Second-Hand trades&mdash;that in Clothing. In
this table the reader will find included every
indispensable article of man’s, woman’s, and
child’s apparel, as well as those articles which
add to the ornament or comfort of the person
of the wearer; such as boas and victorines for
the use of one sex, and dressing-gowns for the
use of the other. The articles used to protect
us from the rain, or the too-powerful rays
of the sun, are also included&mdash;umbrellas and
parasols. The whole of these articles exceed,
when taken in round numbers, twelve millions
and a quarter, and that reckoning the “pairs,”
as in boots and shoes, &amp;c., as but one article.
This, still pursuing the round-number system,
would supply nearly <i>five</i> articles of refuse
apparel to every man, woman, and child in this,
the greatest metropolis of the world.</p>

<p>I will put this matter in another light. There
are about 35,000 Jews in England, nearly half of
whom reside in the metropolis. 12,000, it is
further stated on good authority, reside within
the City of London. Now at one time the
trade in old clothes was almost entirely in the
hands of the City Jews, the others prosecuting
the same calling in different parts of
London having been “Wardrobe Dealers,”
chiefly women, (who had not unfrequently
been the servants of the aristocracy); and
even these wardrobe dealers sold much that was
worn, and (as one old clothes-dealer told me)
much that was “not, for their fine customers,
because the fashion had gone by,” to the “Old
Clo” Jews, or to those to whom the street-buyers
carried their stock, and who were able
to purchase on a larger scale than the general
itinerants. Now, supposing that even one
twelfth of these 12,000 Israelites were engaged
in the old-clothes trade (which is far
beyond the mark), each man would have
<i>twelve hundred and twenty-five</i> articles to dispose
of yearly, all second-hand!</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious trade is that in
waste paper, or as it is called by the street collectors,
in “waste,” comprising every kind of
used or useless periodical, and books in all
tongues. I may call the attention of my readers,
by way of illustrating the extent of this business
in what is proverbially refuse “waste paper,”
to their experience of the penny postage.
Three or four sheets of note paper, according to
the stouter or thinner texture, and an envelope
with a seal or a glutinous and stamped fastening,
will not exceed half-an-ounce, and is conveyed
to the Orkneys and the further isles of
Shetland, the Hebrides, the Scilly and Channel
Islands, the isles of Achill and Cape Clear,
off the western and southern coasts of Ireland,
or indeed to and from the most extreme
points of the United Kingdom, and no matter
what distance, provided the letter be posted
within the United Kingdom, for a penny.
The weight of waste or refuse paper annually
disposed of to the street collectors, or rather
buyers, is 1,397,760 lbs. Were this tonnage,
as I may call it, for it comprises 12,480 tons
yearly, to be distributed in half-ounce letters,
it would supply material, as respects weight,
for <i>forty-four millions, seven hundred and twenty-eight
thousand, four hundred and thirty</i> letters
on business, love, or friendship.</p>

<p>I will next direct attention to what may be,
by perhaps not over-straining a figure of
speech, called “the crumbs which fall from
the rich man’s table;” or, according to the
quality of the commodity of refuse, of the
tables of the <i>comparatively</i> rich, and that down
to a low degree of the scale. These are not,
however, unappropriated crumbs, to be swept
away uncared for; but are objects of keen
traffic and bargains between the possessors or
their servants and the indefatigable street-folk.
Among them are such things as champagne
and other wine bottles, porter and ale bottles,
and, including the establishments of all the
rich and the comparative rich, kitchen-stuff,
dripping, hog-wash, hare-skins, and tea-leaves.
Lastly come the very lowest grades of the
street-folk&mdash;the <i>finders</i>; men who will quarrel,
and have been seen to quarrel, with a hungry
cur for a street-found bone; not to pick or
gnaw, although Eugène Sue has seen that
done in Paris; and I once, very early on a
summer’s morning, saw some apparently houseless
Irish children contend with a dog and
with each other for bones thrown out of a
house in King William-street, City&mdash;as if after
a very late supper&mdash;not to pick or gnaw, I was
saying, but to <i>sell</i> for manure. Some of these
finders have “seen better days;” others, in
intellect, are little elevated above the animals
whose bones they gather, or whose ordure
(“pure”), they scrape into their baskets.</p>

<p>I do not know that the other articles in the
arrangement of the table of street refuse, &amp;c.,
require any further comment. Broken metal,
&amp;c., can only be disposed of according to its
quality or weight, and I have lately shown the
extent of the trade in such refuse as street-sweepings,
soot and night-soil.</p>

<p>The gross total, or average yearly money
value, is 1,406,592<i>l.</i> for the second-hand commodities
I have described in the foregoing
pages; or as something like a minimum is
given, both as to the number of the goods
and the price, we may fairly put this total at a
million and a half of pounds sterling!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="CROSSING-SWEEPERS"></a>CROSSING-SWEEPERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>That portion of the London street-folk who
earn a scanty living by sweeping crossings
constitute a large class of the Metropolitan
poor. We can scarcely walk along a street of
any extent, or pass through a square of the
least pretensions to “gentility,” without meeting
one or more of these private scavengers.
Crossing-sweeping seems to be one of those
occupations which are resorted to as an excuse
for begging; and, indeed, as many expressed it
to me, “it was the last chance left of obtaining
an honest crust.”</p>

<p>The advantages of crossing-sweeping as a
means of livelihood seem to be:</p>

<p>1st, the smallness of the capital required in
order to commence the business;</p>

<p>2ndly, the excuse the apparent occupation
it affords for soliciting gratuities without being
considered in the light of a street-beggar;</p>

<p>And 3rdly, the benefits arising from being
constantly seen in the same place, and thus
exciting the sympathy of the neighbouring
householders, till small weekly allowances or
“pensions” are obtained.</p>

<p>The first curious point in connexion with
this subject is what constitutes the “<i>property</i>,”
so to speak, in a crossing, or the <i>right</i> to sweep a
pathway across a certain thoroughfare. A nobleman,
who has been one of her Majesty’s Ministers,
whilst conversing with me on the subject
of crossing-sweepers, expressed to me the
curiosity he felt on the subject, saying that he
had noticed some of the sweepers in the same
place for years. “What were the rights of
property,” he asked, “in such cases, and what
constituted the title that such a man had to
a particular crossing? Why did not the stronger
sweeper supplant the weaker? Could a man
bequeath a crossing to a son, or present it to
a friend? How did he first obtain the spot?”</p>

<p>The answer is, that crossing-sweepers are,
in a measure, under the protection of the
police. If the accommodation afforded by a
well-swept pathway is evident, the policeman
on that district will protect the original
sweeper of the crossing from the intrusion of
a rival. I have, indeed, met with instances of
men who, before taking to a crossing, have
asked for and obtained permission of the
police; and one sweeper, who gave me his
statement, had even solicited the authority of
the inhabitants before he applied to the inspector
at the station-house.</p>

<p>If a crossing have been vacant for some
time, another sweeper may take to it; but
should the original proprietor again make his
appearance, the officer on duty will generally
re-establish him. One man to whom I spoke,
had fixed himself on a crossing which for
years another sweeper had kept clean on the
Sunday morning only. A dispute ensued; the
one claimant pleading his long Sabbath possession,
and the other his continuous every-day
service. The quarrel was referred to the
police, who decided that he who was oftener
on the ground was the rightful owner; and
the option was given to the former possessor,
that if he would sweep there every day the
crossing should be his.</p>

<p>I believe there is only one crossing in
London which is in the gift of a householder,
and this proprietorship originated in a tradesman
having, at his own expense, caused a
paved footway to be laid down over the Macadamized
road in front of his shop, so that his
customers might run less chance of dirtying
their boots when they crossed over to give
their orders.</p>

<p>Some bankers, however, keep a crossing-sweeper,
not only to sweep a clean path for
the “clients” visiting their house, but to open
and shut the doors of the carriages calling at
the house.</p>

<p>Concerning the <i>causes which lead or drive</i>
people to this occupation, they are various.
People take to crossing-sweeping either on
account of their bodily afflictions, depriving
them of the power of performing ruder work,
or because the occupation is the last resource
left open to them of earning a living, and
they considered even the scanty subsistence
it yields preferable to that of the workhouse.
The greater proportion of crossing-sweepers
are those who, from some bodily infirmity
or injury, are prevented from a more
laborious mode of obtaining their living.
Among the bodily infirmities the chief are old
age, asthma, and rheumatism; and the injuries
mostly consist of loss of limbs. Many
of the rheumatic sweepers have been bricklayers’
labourers.</p>

<p>The classification of crossing-sweepers is
not very complex. They may be divided into
the <i>casual</i> and the <i>regular</i>.</p>

<p>By the casual I mean such as pursue the
occupation only on certain days in the week, as,
for instance, those who make their appearance
on the Sunday morning, as well as the boys
who, broom in hand, travel about the streets,
sweeping before the foot-passengers or stopping
an hour at one place, and then, if not
fortunate, moving on to another.</p>

<p>The regular crossing-sweepers are those who
have taken up their posts at the corners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
streets or squares; and I have met with some
who have kept to the same spot for more than
forty years.</p>

<p>The crossing-sweepers in the squares may
be reckoned among the most fortunate of the
class. With them the crossing is a kind of
stand, where any one requiring their services
knows they may be found. These sweepers
are often employed by the butlers and servants
in the neighbouring mansions for running
errands, posting letters, and occasionally helping
in the packing-up and removal of furniture
or boxes when the family goes out of town.
I have met with other sweepers who, from
being known for years to the inhabitants, have
at last got to be regularly employed at some
of the houses to clean knives, boots, windows,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>It is not at all an unfrequent circumstance,
however, for a sweeper to be in receipt of a
weekly sum from some of the inhabitants in
the district. The crossing itself is in these
cases but of little value for chance customers,
for were it not for the regular charity of the
householders, it would be deserted. Broken
victuals and old clothes also form part of a
sweeper’s means of living; nor are the clothes
always old ones, for one or two of this class
have for years been in the habit of having new
suits presented to them by the neighbours at
Christmas.</p>

<p>The irregular sweepers mostly consist of
boys and girls who have formed themselves
into a kind of company, and come to an agreement
to work together on the same crossings.
The principal resort of these is about Trafalgar-square,
where they have seized upon some
three or four crossings, which they visit from
time to time in the course of the day.</p>

<p>One of these gangs I found had appointed
its king and captain, though the titles were
more honorary than privileged. They had
framed their own laws respecting each one’s
right to the money he took, and the obedience
to these laws was enforced by the strength of
the little fraternity.</p>

<p>One or two girls whom I questioned, told
me that they mixed up ballad-singing or lace-selling
with crossing-sweeping, taking to the
broom only when the streets were wet and
muddy. These children are usually sent out
by their parents, and have to carry home at
night their earnings. A few of them are
orphans with a lodging-house for a home.</p>

<p>Taken as a class, crossing-sweepers are
among the most honest of the London poor.
They all tell you that, without a good character
and “the respect of the neighbourhood,” there
is not a living to be got out of the broom.
Indeed, those whom I found best-to-do in the
world were those who had been longest at
their posts.</p>

<p>Among them are many who have been servants
until sickness or accident deprived them
of their situations, and nearly all of them have
had their minds so subdued by affliction, that
they have been tamed so as to be incapable of
mischief.</p>

<p>The <i>earnings</i>, or rather “<i>takings</i>,” of crossing-sweepers
are difficult to estimate&mdash;generally
speaking&mdash;that is, to strike the average
for the entire class. An erroneous idea prevails
that crossing-sweeping is a lucrative employment.
All whom I have spoken with agree
in saying, that some thirty years back it was a
good living; but they bewail piteously the
spirit of the present generation. I have met
with some who, in former days, took their 3<i>l.</i>
weekly; and there are but few I have spoken
to who would not, at one period, have considered
fifteen shillings a bad week’s work.
But now “the takings” are very much reduced.
The man who was known to this class as having
been the most prosperous of all&mdash;for from
one nobleman alone he received an allowance
of seven shillings and sixpence weekly&mdash;assured
me that twelve shillings a-week was the
average of his present gains, taking the year
round; whilst the majority of the sweepers
agree that a shilling is a good day’s earnings.</p>

<p>A shilling a-day is the very limit of the
average incomes of the London sweepers, and
this is rather an over than an under calculation;
for, although a few of the more fortunate,
who are to be found in the squares or main
thoroughfares or opposite the public buildings,
may earn their twelve or fifteen shillings a-week,
yet there are hundreds who are daily to
be found in the by-streets of the metropolis
who assert that eightpence a-day is their average
taking; and, indeed, in proof of their
poverty, they refer you to the workhouse authorities,
who allow them certain quartern-loaves
weekly. The old stories of delicate suppers
and stockings full of money have in the present
day no foundation of truth.</p>

<p>The black crossing-sweeper, who bequeathed
500<i>l.</i> to Miss Waithman, would almost seem
to be the last of the class whose earnings were
above his positive necessities.</p>

<p>Lastly, concerning the <i>numbers</i> belonging to
this large class, we may add that it is difficult
to reckon up the number of crossing-sweepers
in London. There are few squares without a
couple of these pathway scavengers; and in
the more respectable squares, such as Cavendish
or Portman, every corner has been seized
upon. Again, in the principal thoroughfares,
nearly every street has its crossing and attendant.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;OF THE ADULT CROSSING-SWEEPERS.</h3>


<p class="center"><i>A. The Able-Bodied Sweepers.</i></p>

<p>The elder portion of the London crossing-sweepers
admit, as we have before said, of
being arranged, for the sake of perspicuity,
into several classes. I shall begin with the
<i>Able-bodied Males</i>; then proceed to the <i>Females</i>
of the same class; and afterwards deal with
the <i>Able-bodied Irish</i> (male and female), who
take to the London causeways for a living.
This done, I shall then, in due order, take
up the <i>Afflicted</i> or <i>Crippled</i> class; and finally
treat of the <i>Juveniles</i> belonging to the same
calling.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">1. The Able-Bodied Male Crossing-Sweepers.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">The “Aristocratic” Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>“Billy” is the popular name of the man
who for many years has swept the long
crossing that cuts off one corner of Cavendish-square,
making a “short cut” from Old
Cavendish-street to the Duke of Portland’s
mansion.</p>

<p>Billy is a merry, good-tempered kind of man,
with a face as red as a love-apple, and cheeks
streaked with little veins.</p>

<p>His hair is white, and his eyes are as black
and bright as a terrier’s. He can hardly speak
a sentence without finishing it off with a moist
chuckle.</p>

<p>His clothes have that peculiar look which
arises from being often wet through, but still
they are decent, and far above what his class
usually wear. The hat is limp in the brim,
from being continually touched.</p>

<p>The day when I saw Billy was a wet one, and
he had taken refuge from a shower under the
Duke of Portland’s stone gateway. His tweed
coat, torn and darned, was black about the
shoulders with the rain-drops, and his boots
grey with mud, but, he told me, “It was no
good trying to keep clean shoes such a day as
that, ’cause the blacking come off in the
puddles.”</p>

<p>Billy is “well up” in the <i>Court Guide</i>. He
continually stopped in his statement to tell
whom my Lord B. married, or where my Lady
C. had gone to spend the summer, or what was
the title of the Marquis So-and-So’s eldest
boy.</p>

<p>He was very grateful, moreover, to all who
had assisted him, and <i>would</i> stop looking up at
the ceiling, and God-blessing them all with a
species of religious fervour.</p>

<p>His regret that the good old times had passed,
when he made “hats full of money,” was unmistakably
sincere; and when he had occasion
to allude to them, he always delivered his
opinion upon the late war, calling it “a-cut-and
run affair,” and saying that it was “nothing at
all put alongside with the old war, when the
halfpence and silver coin were twice as big and
twenty times more plentiful” than during the
late campaign.</p>

<p>Without the least hesitation he furnished me
with the following particulars of his life and
<span class="lock">calling:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was born in London, in Cavendish-square,
and (he added, laughing) I ought to have a
title, for I first came into the world at No. 3,
which was Lord Bessborough’s then. My
mother went there to do her work, for she
chaired there, and she was took sudden and
couldn’t go no further. She couldn’t have
chosen a better place, could she? You see I
was born in Cavendish-square, and I’ve <i>worked</i>
in Cavendish-square&mdash;sweeping a crossing&mdash;for
now near upon fifty year.</p>

<p>“Until I was nineteen&mdash;I’m sixty-nine now&mdash;I
used to sell water-creases, but they felled
off and then I dropped it. Both mother and
myself sold water-creases after my Lord Bessborough
died; for whilst he lived she wouldn’t
leave him not for nothing.</p>

<p>“We used to do uncommon well at one time;
there wasn’t nobody about then as there is now.
I’ve sold flowers, too; they was very good
then; they was mostly show carnations and
moss roses, and such-like, but no common
flowers&mdash;it wouldn’t have done for me to
sell common things at the houses I used to
go to.</p>

<p>“The reason why I took to a crossing was, I
had an old father and I didn’t want him to go
to the workus. I didn’t wish too to do anything
bad myself, and I never would&mdash;no, sir, for
I’ve got as good a charackter as the first nobleman
in the land, and that’s a fine thing, ain’t
it? So as water-creases had fell off till they
wasn’t a living to me, I had to do summat else
to help me to live.</p>

<p>“I saw the crossing-sweepers in Westminster
making a deal of money, so I thought to myself
<i>I’ll</i> do that, and I fixed upon Cavendish-square,
because, I said to myself, I’m known
there; it’s where I was born, and there I set
to work.</p>

<p>“The very first day I was at work I took ten
shillings. I never asked nobody; I only
bowed my head and put my hand to my hat,
and they knowed what it meant.</p>

<p>“By jingo, when I took that there I thought
to myself, What a fool I’ve been to stop at
water-creases!</p>

<p>“For the first ten year I did uncommon well.
Give me the old-fashioned way; they were
good times then; I like the old-fashioned way.
Give me the old penny pieces, and then the
eighteen-penny pieces, and the three-shilling
pieces, and the seven-shilling pieces&mdash;give me
them, I says. The day the old halfpence and
silver was cried down, that is, the old coin
was called in to change the currency, my
hat wouldn’t hold the old silver and halfpence
I was give that afternoon. I had <i>such</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
lot, upon my word, they broke my pocket. I
didn’t know the money was altered, but a fishmonger
says to me, ‘Have you got any old
silver?’ I said ‘Yes, I’ve got a hat full;’ and
then says he, ‘Take ’em down to Couttseses
and change ’em.’ I went, and I was nearly
squeeged to death.</p>

<p>“That was the first time I was like to be
killed, but I was nigh killed again when Queen
Caroline passed through Cavendish-square
after her trial. They took the horses out of
her carriage and pulled her along. She kept
a chucking money out of the carriage, and I
went and scrambled for it, and I got five-and-twenty
shillin, but my hand was a nigh smashed
through it; and, says a friend of mine, before
I went, ‘Billy,’ says he, ‘don’t you go;’ and I
was sorry after I did. She was a good woman,
<i>she</i> was. The Yallers, that is, the king’s party,
was agin her, and pulled up the paving-stones
when her funeral passed; but the Blues was
for her.</p>

<p>“I can remember, too, the mob at the time
of the Lord Castlereagh riots. They went to
Portman-square and broke all the winders in
the house. They pulled up all the rails to
purtect theirselves with. I went to the Bishop
of Durham’s, and hid myself in the coal-cellar
then. My mother chaired there, too. The
Bishop of Durham and Lord Harcourt opened
their gates and hurrah’d the mob, so they had
nothing of their’s touched; but whether they
did it through fear or not I can’t say. The
mob was carrying a quartern loaf dipped in
bullock’s blood, and when I saw it I thought
it was a man’s head; so that frightened me,
and I run off.</p>

<p>“I remember, too, when Lady Pembroke’s
house was burnt to the ground. That’s about
eighteen year ago. It was very lucky the family
wasn’t in town. The housekeeper was a nigh
killed, and they had to get her out over the
stables; and when her ladyship heard she was
all right, she said she didn’t care for the fire
since the old dame was saved, for she had lived
along with the family for many years. No,
bless you, sir! I didn’t help at the fire; I’m too
much of a coward to do that.</p>

<p>“All the time the Duke of Portland was
alive he used to allow me 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a-week, which
was 1<i>s.</i> a-day and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for Sundays. He was
a little short man, and a very good man he was
too, for it warn’t only me as he gave money to,
but to plenty others. He was the best man in
England for that.</p>

<p>“Lord George Bentinck, too, was a good
friend to me. He was a great racer, he was,
and then he turned to be member of parliament,
and then he made a good man they tell me;
but he never comed over my crossing without
giving me something. He was at the corner
of Holly Street, he was, and he never put foot
on my crossing without giving me a sovereign.
Perhaps he wouldn’t cross more than once or
twice a month, but when he comed my way
<i>that</i> was his money. Ah! he was a nice feller,
he was. When he give it he always put
it in my hand and never let nobody see it,
and that’s the way I like to have <i>my</i> fee give
me.</p>

<p>“There’s Mrs. <span class="lock">D&mdash;&mdash;</span>, too, as lived at No. 6;
she was a good friend of mine, and always
allowed me a suit of clothes a-year; but she’s
dead, good lady, now.</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="lock">C&mdash;&mdash;</span> and his lady, they, likewise, was
very kind friends of mine, and gave me every
year clothes, and new shoes, and blankets, aye,
and a bed, too, if I had wanted it; but now
they are all dead, down to the coachman. The
doctor’s old butler, Mr. <span class="lock">K&mdash;&mdash;</span>, he gave me
twenty-five shillings the day of the funeral,
and, says he, ‘Bill, I’m afraid this will be the
last.’ Poor good friends they was all of them,
and I did feel cut up when I see the hearse
going off.</p>

<p>“There was another gentleman, Mr. W.
<span class="lock">T&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who lives in Harley-street; he never
come by me without giving me half-a-crown.
He was a real good gentleman; but I haven’t
seen him for a long time now, and perhaps
he’s dead too.</p>

<p>“All my friends is dropping off. I’m fifty-five,
and they was men when I was a boy.
All the good gentlemen’s gone, only the bad
ones stop.</p>

<p>“Another friend of mine is Lord <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>.
He always drops me a shilling when he come
by; and, says he, ‘You don’t know me, but
I knows you, Billy.’ But I <i>do</i> know him, for
my mother worked for the family many a
year, and, considering I was born in the house,
I think to myself, ‘If I don’t know you, why
I ought.’ He’s a handsome, stout young
chap, and as nice a gentleman as any in the
land.</p>

<p>“One of the best friends I had was Prince
<span class="lock">E&mdash;&mdash;</span>, as lived there in Chandos-street, the
bottom house yonder. I had five sovereigns
give me the day as he was married to his
beautiful wife. Don’t you remember what a
talk there was about her diamonds, sir? They
say she was kivered in ’em. He used to put
his hand in his pocket and give me two or
three shillings every time he crossed. He
was a gentleman as was uncommon fond of
the gals, sir. He’d go and talk to all the
maid-servants round about, if they was only
good-looking. I used to go and ring the hairy
bells for him, and tell the gals to go and
meet him in Chapel-street. God bless him!
I says, he was a pleasant gentleman, and a
regular good ’un for a bit of fun, and always
looking lively and smiling. I see he’s got his
old coachman yet, though the Prince don’t
live in England at present, but his son does,
and he always gives me a half-crown when
he comes by too.</p>

<p>“I gets a pretty fine lot of Christmas boxes,
but nothing like what I had in the old times.
Prince <span class="lock">E&mdash;&mdash;</span> always gives me half a crown,
and I goes to the butler for it. Pretty near
all my friends gives me a box, them as knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
me, and they say, ‘Here’s a Christmas box,
Billy.’</p>

<p>“Last Christmas-day I took 36<i>s.</i>, and that
was pretty fair; but, bless you, in the old
times I’ve had my hat full of money. I tells
you again I’ve have had as much as 5<i>l.</i> in
old times, all in old silver and halfpence;
that was in the old war, and not this runaway
shabby affair.</p>

<p>“Every Sunday I have sixpence regular
from Lord <span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, whether he’s in town or
not. I goes and fetches it. Mrs. <span class="lock">D&mdash;&mdash;</span>, of
Harley-street, she gives me a shilling every
Sunday when she’s in town; and the parents
as knows me give halfpence to their little girls
to give me. Some of the little ladies says,
‘Here, that will do you good.’ No, it’s only
pennies (for sixpences is out of fashion);
and thank God for the coppers, though they
are little.</p>

<p>“I generally, when the people’s out of town,
take about 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on the Sunday. Last
Sunday I only took 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, but then, you see,
it come on to rain and I didn’t stop. When
the town’s full three people alone gives me
more than that. In the season I take 5<i>s.</i> safe
on a Sunday, or perhaps 6<i>s.</i>&mdash;for you see it’s
all like a lottery.</p>

<p>“I should like you to mention Lady Mildmay
in Grosvenor-square, sir. Whenever I
goes to see her&mdash;but you know I don’t go
often&mdash;I’m safe for 5<i>s.</i>, and at Christmas I
have my regular salary, a guinea. She’s a
very old lady, and I’ve knowed her for many
and many years. When I goes to my lady
she always comes out to speak to me at the
door, and says she, ‘Oh, ’tis Willy! and how
do you do, Willy?’ and she always shakes
hands with me and laughs away. Ah! she’s
a good kind creetur’; there’s no pride in her
whatsumever&mdash;and she never sacks her servants.</p>

<p>“My crossing has been a good living to me
and mine. It’s kept the whole of us. Ah!
in the old time I dare say I’ve made as much
as 3<i>l.</i> a week reg’lar by it. Besides, I used
to have lots of broken vittals, and I can tell
you I know’d where to take ’em to. Ah! I’ve
had as much food as I could carry away, and
reg’lar good stuff&mdash;chicken, and some things
I couldn’t guess the name of, they was so
Frenchified. When the fam’lies is in town I
gets a good lot of food given me, but you
know when the nobility and gentlemen are
away the servants is on board wages, and cuss
them board wages, I says.</p>

<p>“I buried my father and mother as a son
ought to. Mother was seventy-three and
father was sixty-five,&mdash;good round ages, ain’t
they, sir? I shall never live to be that. They
are lying in St. John’s Wood cemetery along
with many of my brothers and sisters, which
I have buried as well. I’ve only two brothers
living now; and, poor fellows, they’re not very
well to do. It cost me a good bit of money.
I pay 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a-year for keeping up the graves
of each of my parents, and 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> for my
brothers.</p>

<p>“There was the Earl of Gainsborough as I
should like you to mention as well, please sir.
He lived in Chandos-street, and was a particular
nice man and very religious. He always
gave me a shilling and a tract. Well,
you see, I <i>did</i> often read the tract; they was
all religious, and about where your souls was
to go to&mdash;very good, you know, what there
was, very good; and he used to buy ’em wholesale
at a little shop, corner of High-street,
Marrabun. He was a very good, kind gentleman,
and gave away such a deal of money
that he got reg’lar known, and the little beggar
girls follered him at such a rate that he was
at last forced to ride about in a cab to get
away from ’em. He’s many a time said to
me, when he’s stopped to give me my shilling,
‘Billy, is any of ’em a follering me?’ He was
safe to give to every body as asked him, but
you see it worried his soul out&mdash;and it was a
kind soul, too&mdash;to be follered about by a mob.</p>

<p>“When all the fam’lies is in town I has 14<i>s.</i>
a-week reg’lar as clock-work from my friends
as lives round the square, and when they’re
away I don’t get 6<i>d.</i> a-day, and sometimes I
don’t get 1<i>d.</i> a-day, and that’s less. You
see some of ’em, like my Lord <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, is out
eight months in the year; and some of ’em,
such as my Lord <span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, is only three. Then
Mrs. <span class="lock">D&mdash;&mdash;</span>, she’s away three months, and she
always gives 1<i>s.</i> a-week reg’lar when she’s up
in London.</p>

<p>“I don’t take 4<i>s.</i> a-week on the crossing.
Ah! I wish you’d give me 4<i>s.</i> for what I take.
No, I make up by going of errands. I runs
for the fam’lies, and the servants, and any of
’em. Sometimes they sends me to a banker’s
with a cheque. Bless you! they’d trust me
with anythink, if it was a hat full. I’ve had
a lot of money trusted to me at times. At
one time I had as much as 83<i>l.</i> to carry for
the Duke of Portland.</p>

<p>“Aye, that was a go&mdash;<i>that</i> was! You see
the hall-porter had had it give to him to carry
to the bank, and he gets me to do it for him;
but the vallet heerd of it, so he wanted to
have a bit of fun, and he wanted to put the
hall-porter in a funk. I met the vallet in
Holborn, and says he, ‘Bill, I want to have
a lark,’ so he kept me back, and I did not get
back till one o’clock. The hall-porter offered
5<i>l.</i> reward for me, and sends the police; but
Mr. Freebrother, Lord George’s wallet, he
says, ‘I’ll make it all right, Billy.’ They sent
up to my poor old people, and says father,
‘Billy wouldn’t rob anybody of a nightcap,
much more 80<i>l.</i>’ I met the policeman in
Holborn, and says he, ‘I want you, Billy,’ and
says I, ‘All right, here I am.’ When I got
home the hall-porter, says he, ‘Oh, I am a dead
man; where’s the money?’ and says I, ‘It’s
lost.’ ‘Oh! it’s the Duke’s, not mine,’ says he.
Then I pulls it out; and says the porter, ‘It’s
a lark of Freebrother’s.’ So he gave me 2<i>l.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
to make it all right. That <i>was</i> a game, and
the hall-porter, says he, ‘I really thought
you was gone, Billy;’ but, says I, ‘If everybody
carried as good a face as I do, everybody
would be as honest as any in Cavendish-square.’</p>

<p>“I had another lark at the Bishop of Durham’s.
I was a cleaning the knives, and a
swellmobsman, with a green-baize bag, come
down the steps, and says he to me, ‘Is Mr.
Lewis, the butler, in?’&mdash;he’d got the name
off quite pat. ‘No,’ says I, ‘he’s up-stairs;’
then says he, ‘Can I step into the pantry?’
‘Oh, yes,’ says I, and shows him in.
Bless you! he was so well-dressed, I thought
he was a master-shoemaker or something;
but as all the plate was there, thinks I, I’ll just
lock the door to make safe. So I fastens him
in tight, and keeps him there till Mr. Lewis
comes. No, he didn’t take none of the plate,
for Mr. Lewis come down, and then, as he
didn’t know nothink about him, we had in a
policeman, when we finds his bag was stuffed
with silver tea-pots and all sorts of things
from my Lord Musgrave’s. Says Mr. Lewis,
‘You did quite right, Billy.’ It wasn’t a likely
thing I was going to let anybody into a pantry
crammed with silver.</p>

<p>“There was another chap who had prigged
a lot of plate. He was an old man, and had a
bag crammed with silver, and was a cutting
away, with lots of people after him. So I
puts my broom across his legs and tumbles
him, and when he got up he cut away and
left the bag. Ah! I’ve seen a good many
games in my time&mdash;that I have. The butler
of the house the plate had been stole from
give me 2<i>l.</i> for doing him that turn.</p>

<p>“Once a gentleman called me, and says he,
‘My man, how long have you been in this
square?’ Says I, ‘I’m Billy, and been here
a’most all my life.’ Then he says, ‘Can I
trust you to take a cheque to Scott, the banker?’
and I answers, ‘That’s as you like,’ for I
wasn’t going to press him. It was a heavy
cheque, for Mr. Scott, as knows me well&mdash;aye,
well, he do&mdash;says ‘Billy, I can’t give
you all in notes, you must stop a bit.’ It
nearly filled the bag I had with me. I took
it all safe back, and says he, ‘Ah! I knowed
it would be all right,’ and he give me a
half-sovereign. I should like you to put
these things down, ’cos it’s a fine thing for
my charackter, and I can show my face with
any man for being honest, that’s one good
thing.</p>

<p>“I pays 4<i>s.</i> a-week for two rooms, one up
and one down, for I couldn’t live in one room.
I come to work always near eight o’clock, for
you see it takes me some time to clean the
knives and boots at Lord <span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s. I get
sometimes 1<i>s.</i> and sometimes 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a-week
for doing that, and glad I am to have it. It’s
only for the servants I does it, not for the
quality.</p>

<p>“When I does anythink for the servants, it’s
either cleaning boots and knives, or putting
letters in the post&mdash;that’s it&mdash;anythink of that
kind. They gives me just what they can, 1<i>d.</i>
or 2<i>d.</i> or half a pint of beer when they ha’n’t
got any coppers.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I gets a few left-off clothes,
but very seldom. I have two suits a-year give
me reg’lar, and I goes to a first-rate tailor for
’em, though they don’t make the prime&mdash;of
course not, yet they’re very good. Now this
coat I liked very well when it was new, it was
so clean and tidy. No, the tailor don’t show
me the pattern-books and that sort of thing:
he knows what’s wanted. I won’t never have
none of them washing duck breeches; that’s
the only thing as I refuses, and the tailor
knows that. I looks very nice after Christmas,
I can tell you, and I’ve always got a good tidy
suit for Sundays, and God bless them as gives
’em to me.</p>

<p>“Every Sunday I gets a hot dinner at Lord
<span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s, whether he’s out of town or in town&mdash;that’s
summat. I gets bits, too, give me,
so that I don’t buy a dinner, no, not once a-week.
I pays 4<i>s.</i> a-week rent, and I dare say
my food, morning and night, costs me a 1<i>s.</i>
a-day&mdash;aye, I’m sure it does, morning and
night. At present I don’t make 12<i>s.</i> a-week;
but take the year round, one week with another,
it might come to 13<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i> a-week I
gets. Yes, I’ll own to that.</p>

<p>“Christmas is my best time; then I gets more
than 1<i>l.</i> a-week: now I don’t take 4<i>s.</i> a-week
on my crossing. Many’s the time I’ve made
my breakfast on a pen’orth of coffee and a
halfpenny slice of bread and butter. What
do you think of that?</p>

<p>“Wet weather does all the harm to me.
People, you see, don’t like to come out. I
think I’ve got the best side of the square, and
you see my crossing is a long one, and saves
people a deal of ground, for it cuts off the
corner. It used to be a famous crossing in
its time&mdash;hah! but that’s gone.</p>

<p>“I always uses what they calls the brush-brooms;
that’s them with a flat head like
a house-broom. I can’t abide them others;
they don’t look well, and they wears out
ten times as quick as mine. I general buys
the eights, that’s 10<i>d.</i> a-piece, and finds my
own handles. A broom won’t last me more
than a fortnight, it’s such a long crossing;
but when it was paved, afore this muckydam
(macadamising) was turned up, a broom
would last me a full three months. I can’t
abide this muckydam&mdash;can you, sir? it’s
sloppy stuff, and goes so bad in holes. Give
me the good solid stones as used to be.</p>

<p>“I does a good business round the square
when the snow’s on the ground. I general
does each house at so much a-week whilst
it snows. Hardwicks give me a shilling.
I does only my side, and that next Oxford-street.
I don’t go to the others, unless
somebody comes and orders me&mdash;for
fair play <i>is</i> fair play&mdash;and they belongs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
the other sweepers. I does my part and they
does theirs.</p>

<p>“It’s seldom as I has a shop to sweep out,
and I don’t do nothink with shutters. I’m
getting too old now for to be called in to carry
boxes up gentlemen’s houses, but when I
was young I found plenty to do that way.
There’s a man at the corner of Chandos-street,
and he does the most of that kind of
work.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Bearded Crossing-Sweeper at the
Exchange.</span></h5>

<p>Since the destruction by fire of the Royal
Exchange in 1838, there has been added to the
curiosities of Cornhill a thickset, sturdy, and
hirsute crossing-sweeper&mdash;a man who is as
civil by habit as he is independent by nature.
He has a long flowing beard, grey as wood
smoke, and a pair of fierce moustaches, giving
a patriarchal air of importance to a marked
and observant face, which often serves as a
painter’s model. After half-an-hour’s conversation,
you are forced to admit that his looks
do not all belie him, and that the old mariner
(for such was his profession formerly) is worthy
in some measure of his beard.</p>

<p>He wears an old felt hat&mdash;very battered and
discoloured; around his neck, which is bared
in accordance with sailor custom, he has a
thick blue cotton neckerchief tied in a sailor’s
knot; his long iron-grey beard is accompanied
by a healthy and almost ruddy face. He
stands against the post all day, saying nothing,
and taking what he can get without
solicitation.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE BEARDED CROSSING-SWEEPER AT THE
EXCHANGE.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>When I first spoke to him, he wanted to
know to what purpose I intended applying
the information that he was prepared to afford,
and it was not until I agreed to walk
with him as far as St. Mary-Axe that I
was enabled to obtain his statement, as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve had this crossing ever since ’38. The
Exchange was burnt down in that year. Why,
sir, I was wandering about trying to get a
crust, and it was very sloppy, so I took and
got a broom; and while I kept a clean crossing,
I used to get ha’pence and pence. I got
a dockman’s wages&mdash;that’s half-a-crown a-day;
sometimes only a shilling, and sometimes
more. I have taken a crown&mdash;but that’s very
rare. The best customers I had is dead. I
used to make a good Christmas, but I don’t
now. I have taken a pound or thirty shillings
then in the old times.</p>

<p>“I smoke, sir; I <i>will</i> have tobacco, if I
can’t get grub. My old woman takes cares
that I have tobacco.</p>

<p>“I have been a sailor, and the first ship as
ever I was in was the Old Colossus, 74, but
we was only cruising about the Channel then,
and took two prizes. I went aboard the Old
Remewa guardship&mdash;we were turned over to
her&mdash;and from her I was drafted over to the
Escramander frigate. We went out chasing
Boney, but he gived himself up to the Old
Impregnable. I was at the taking of Algiers,
in 1816, in the Superb. I was in the Rochfort,
74, up the Mediterranean (they call it up
the Mediterranean, but it was the Malta station)
three years, ten months, and twenty
days, until the ship was paid off.</p>

<p>“Then I went to work at the Dockyard.
I had a misfortune soon after that. I fell out
of a garret window, three stories high, and
that kept me from going to the Docks again.
I lost all my top teeth by that fall. I’ve got a
scar here, one on my chin; but I warn’t in the
hospital more than two weeks.</p>

<p>“I was afeard of being taken up solicitin’
charity, and I knew that sweeping was a safe
game; they couldn’t take me up for sweeping
a crossing.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I get insulted, only in words;
sometimes I get chaffed by sober people.
Drunken men I don’t care for; I never listen
to ’em, unless they handle me, and then, although
I am sixty-three this very day, sir, I
think I could show them something. I <i>do</i>
carry my age well; and if you could ha’ seen
how I have lived this last winter through,
sometimes one pound of bread between two
of us, you’d say I was a strong man to be as I
am.</p>

<p>“Those who think that sweepin’ a crossing
is idle work, make a great mistake. In wet
weather, the traffic that makes it gets sloppy
as soon as it’s cleaned. Cabs, and ’busses,
and carriages continually going over the crossing
must scatter the mud on it, and you must
look precious sharp to keep it clean; but when
I once get in the road, I never jump out of it.
I keeps my eye both ways, and if I gets in too
close quarters, I slips round the wheels. I’ve
had them almost touch me.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I never got knocked down. In
foggy weather, of course, it’s no use sweeping
at all.</p>

<p>“Parcels! it’s very few parcels I get to carry
now; I don’t think I get a parcel to carry once
in a month: there’s ’busses and railways so
cheap. A man would charge as much for a
distance as a cab would take them.</p>

<p>“I don’t come to the same crossing on
Sundays; I go to the corner of Finch-lane.
As to regular customers, I’ve none&mdash;to say
regular; some give me sixpence now and
then. All those who used to give me regular
are dead.</p>

<p>“I was a-bed when the Exchange was burnt
down.</p>

<p>“I have had this beard five years. I grew
it to sit to artists when I got the chance; but
it don’t pay expenses&mdash;for I have to walk four
or five miles, and only get a shilling an hour:
besides, I’m often kept nearly two hours, and
I get nothing for going and nothing for coming,
but just for the time I am there.</p>

<p>“Afore I wore it, I had a pair of large whis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>kers.
I went to a gentleman then, an artist,
and he <i>did</i> pay me well. He advised me to
grow mustarshers and the beard, but he hasn’t
employed me since.</p>

<p>“They call me ‘Old Jack’ on the crossing,
that’s all they call me. I get more chaff from
the boys than any one else. They only say,
‘Why don’t you get shaved?’ but I take no
notice on ’em.</p>

<p>“Old Bill, in Lombard Street! I knows him;
he used to make a good thing of it, but I don’t
think he makes much now.</p>

<p>“My wife&mdash;I am married, sir&mdash;doesn’t do
anything. I live in a lodging-house, and I pay
three shillings a-week.</p>

<p>“I tell you what we has, now, when I go
home. We has a pound of bread, a quarter of
an ounce of tea, and perhaps a red herring.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a weakness in my legs for two
year; the veins comes down, but I keep a
bandage in my pocket, and when I feels ’em
coming down, I puts the bandage on ’till the
veins goes up again&mdash;it’s through being on my
legs so long (because I had very strong legs
when young) and want of good food. When
you only have a bit of bread and a cup of tea&mdash;no
meat, no vegetables&mdash;you find it out;
but I’m as upright as a dart, and as lissom as
ever I was.</p>

<p>“I gives threepence for my brooms. I
wears out three in a week in the wet weather.
I always lean very hard on my broom, ’specially
when the mud is sticky&mdash;as it is after the
roads is watered. I am very particular about
my brooms; I gives ’em away to be burned
when many another would use them.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Sweeper in Portman Square, who got
Permission from the Police.</span></h5>

<p>A wild-looking man, with long straggling
grey hair, which stood out from his head as if
he brushed it the wrong way; and whiskers
so thick and curling that they reminded one
of the wool round a sheep’s face, gave me the
accompanying history.</p>

<p>He was very fond of making use of the term
“honest crust,” and each time he did so,
he, Irish-like, pronounced it “currust.” He
seemed a kind-hearted, innocent creature,
half scared by want and old age.</p>

<p>“I’m blest if I can tell which is the best
crossing in London; but mine ain’t no great
shakes, for I don’t take three shilling a-week
not with persons going across, take one week
with another, but I thought I could get a honest
currust (crust) at it, for I’ve got a crippled
hand, which comed of its own accord,
and I was in St. George’s Hospital seven
weeks. When I comed out it was a cripple
with me, and I thought the crossing was
better than going into the workhouse&mdash;for I
likes my liberty.</p>

<p>“I’ve been on this crossing since last
Christmas was a twelvemonth. Before that I
was a bricklayer and plasterer. I’ve been
thirty-two years in London. I can get as good
a character as any one anywhere, please God;
for as to drunkards, and all that, I was none
of them. I was earning eighteen shilling
a-week, and sometimes with my overtime I’ve
had twenty shilling, or even twenty-three shilling.
Bricklayers is paid according to all the
hours they works beyond ten, for that’s the
bricklayer’s day.</p>

<p>“I was among the lime, and the sand, and
the bricks, and then my hand come like this
(he held out a hand with all the fingers
drawn up towards the middle, like the claw of
a dead bird). All the sinews have gone, as
you see yourself, sir, so that I can’t bend it or
straighten it, for the fingers are like bits of
stick, and you can’t bend ’em without breaking
them.</p>

<p>“When I couldn’t lay hold of anything, nor
lift it up, I showed it to master, and he sent
me to his doctor, who gived me something to
rub over it, for it was swelled up like, and
then I went to St. George’s Hospital, and they
cut it over, and asked me if I could come in
doors as in-door patient? and I said Yes, for
I wanted to get it over sooner, and go back to
my work, and earn an honest currust. Then
they scarred it again, cut it seven times, and I
was there many long weeks; and when I
comed out I could not hold any tool, so I was
forced to keep on pawning and pledging to
keep an honest currust in my mouth, and
sometimes I’d only just be with a morsel to
eat, and sometimes I’d be hungry, and that’s
the truth.</p>

<p>“What put me up to crossing-sweeping was
this&mdash;I had no other thing open to me but
the workhouse; but of course I’d sooner be
out on my liberty, though I was entitled to
go into the house, of course, but I’d sooner
keep out of it if I could earn an honest
currust.</p>

<p>“One of my neighbours persuaded me that
I should pick up a good currust at a crossing.
The man who had been on my crossing was
gone dead, and as it was empty, I went down
to the police-office, in Marylebone Lane, and
they told me I might take it, and give me
liberty to stop. I was told the man who had
been there before me had been on it fourteen
years, and them was good times for gentle
and simple and all&mdash;and it was reported that
this man had made a good bit of money, at
least so it was said.</p>

<p>“I thought I could make a living out of it,
or an honest currust, but it’s a very poor living,
I can assure you. When I went to it first,
I done pretty fair for a currust; but it’s only
three shillings to me now. My missus has
such bad health, or she used to help me with
her needle. I can assure you, sir, it’s only
one day a week as I have a bit of dinner,
and I often go without breakfast and supper,
too.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any regular customers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
allow me anything. When the families is in
town sometimes they give me half-a-crown, or
sixpence, now and then, perhaps once a fortnight,
or a month. They’ve got footmen and
servant-maids, so they never wants no parcels
taken&mdash;they make <i>them</i> do it; but sometimes
I get a penny for posting a letter from one of
the maids, or something like that.</p>

<p>“The best day for us is Sunday. Sometimes
I get a shilling, and when the families
is in town eighteen pence. But when the
families is away, and the weather so fine
there’s no mud, and only working-people going
to the chapels, they never looks at me, and
then I’ll only get a shilling.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Another who got Permission to Sweep.</span></h5>

<p>An old Irishman, who comes from Cork, was
spoken of to us as a crossing-sweeper who had
formally obtained permission before exercising
his calling; but I found, upon questioning
him, that it was but little more than a true
Hibernian piece of conciliation on his part;
and, indeed, that out of fear of competition,
he had asked leave of the servants and policeman
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It seems somewhat curious, as illustrative of
the rights of property among crossing-sweepers,
that three or four “intending” sweepers, when
they found themselves forestalled by the old
man in question, had no idea of supplanting
the Irishman, and merely remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, you’re lucky to get it so soon, for we
meant to take it.”</p>

<p>In reply to our questions, the man said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I came here in January last: I knew the
old man was did who used to keep the
crossin’, and I thought I would like the kind
of worruk, for I am getting blind, and hard of
hearing likewise. I’ve got no parish; since
the passing of the last Act, I’ve niver lived
long enough in any one parish for that. I
applied to Marabone, and they offered to sind
me back to Ireland, but I’d got no one to go
to, no friends or relations, or if I have, they’re
as poor there as I am mysilf, sir.</p>

<p>“There was an ould man here before me.
He used to have a stool to rest himsilf on, and
whin he died, last Christmas, a man as knew
him and me asked me whither I would take it
or no, and I said I would. His broom and
stool were in the coal-cellar at this corner
house, Mr. <span class="lock">&mdash;&mdash;’s,</span> where he used to leave
them at night times, and they gave them up
to me; but I didn’t use the stool, sir, it might
be an obsthruction to the passers-by; and,
sir, it looks as if it was infirrumity. But, plaise
the Lord, I’ll git and make a stool for myself
against the hard winter, I will, bein’ a carpenter
by thrade.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask the gintlefolks’ permission to
come here, but I asked the police and the
servants, and such as that. I asked the servants
at the corner-house. I don’t know whither
they could have kept me away if I had
not asked. Soon after I came here the gintlefolks&mdash;some
of them&mdash;stopped and spoke
to me. ‘So,’ says they, ‘you’ve taken the
place of the old man that’s did?’ ‘Yes,
I have,’ says I. ‘Very will,’ says they, and
they give me a ha’penny. That was all that
occurred upon my takin’ to the crossin’.</p>

<p>“But there were some others who would
have taken it if I had not; they tould me I
was lucky in gettin’ it so soon, or they
would have had it, but I don’t know who they
are.</p>

<p>“I am seventy-three years ould the 2d of
June last. My wife is about the same age,
and very much afflicted with the rheumatis,
and she injured hersilf, too, years ago, by
fallin’ off a chair while she was takin’ some
clothes off the line.</p>

<p>“Not to desave you, sir, I get a shillin’ a-week
from one of my childer and ninepence
from another, and a little hilp from some of
the others. I have siven childer livin’, and
have had tin. They are very much scattered:
two are abroad; one is in the tinth Hussars&mdash;he
is kind to me. The one who allows me
ninepence is a basket-maker at Reading; and
the shillin’ I get from my daughter, a servant,
sir. One of my sons died in the Crimmy;
he was in the 13th Light Dragoons, and
died at Scutari, on the 25th of May. They
could not hilp me more than they thry to do,
sir.</p>

<p>“I only make about two shilling a-week
here, sir; and sometimes I don’t take three
ha’pence a day. On Sundays I take about
sivenpence, ninepence, or tinpence, ’cordin’ as
I see the people who give rigular.</p>

<p>“Weather makes no difference to me&mdash;for,
though the sum is small, I am a rigular pinsioner
like of theirs. I go to Somer’s-town Chapel,
being a Catholic, for I’m not ashamed to
own my religion before any man. When I go,
it is at siven in the evening. Sometimes I
go to St. Pathrick’s Chapel, Soho-square. I
have not been to confission for two or three
years&mdash;the last time was to Mr. Stanton, at
St. Pathrick’s.</p>

<p>“There’s a poor woman, sir, who goes past
here every Friday to get her pay from the
parish, and, as sure as she comes back again,
she gives me a ha’penny&mdash;she does, indeed.
Sometimes the baker or the greengrocer gives
me a ha’penny for minding their baskets.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly satisfied; it’s no use to
grumble, and I might be worrus off, sir. Yes,
I go of arrinds some times; fitch water now
and then, and post letters; but I do no odd
jobs, such as hilping the servants to clean the
knives, or such-like. No: they wouldn’t let
me behint the shadow of their doors.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">A Third who asked Leave.</span></h5>

<p>This one was a mild and rather intelligent
man, in a well worn black dress-coat and waistcoat,
a pair of “moleskin” trousers, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
blue-and-white cotton neckerchief. I found
him sweeping the crossing at the end of
&mdash;&mdash; place, opposite the church.</p>

<p>He every now and then regaled himself
with a pinch of snuff, which seemed to light
up his careworn face. He seemed very willing
to afford me information. He <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have been on this crossing four years.
I am a bricklayer by trade; but you see how
my fingers have gone: it’s all rheumatics, sir.
I took a great many colds. I had a great
deal of underground work, and that tries a
man very much.</p>

<p>“How did I get the crossing? Well, I took
it&mdash;I came as a cas’alty. No one ever interfered
with me. If one man leaves a crossing,
well, another takes it.</p>

<p>“Yes, some crossings is worth a good deal
of money. There was a black in Regent-street,
at the corner of Conduit-street, I think, who
had two or three houses&mdash;at least, I’ve heard
so; and I know for a certainty that the man
in Cavendish-square used to get so much a
week from the Duke of Portland&mdash;he got a
shilling a-day, and eighteenpence on Sundays.
I don’t know why he got more on Sundays. I
don’t know whether he gets it since the old
Duke’s death.</p>

<p>“The boys worry me. I mean the little
boys with brooms; they are an abusive set,
and give me a good deal of annoyance; they
are so very cheeky; they watch the police
away; but if they see the police coming, they
bolt like a shot. There are a great many
Irish lads among them. There were not
nearly so many boys about a few years ago.</p>

<p>“I once made eighteenpence in one day,
that was the best day I ever made: it was very
bad weather: but, take the year through, I
don’t make more than sixpence a-day.</p>

<p>“I haven’t worked at bricklaying for a
matter of six year. What did I do for the two
years before I took to crossing-sweeping?
Why, sir, I had saved a little money, and
managed to get on somehow. Yes, I have
had my troubles, but I never had what I call
great ones, excepting my wife’s blindness.
She was blind, sir, for eleven year, and so I
had to fight for everything: she has been dead
two year, come September.</p>

<p>“I have seven children, five boys and two
girls; they are all grown up and got families.
Yes, they ought, amongst them, to do something
for me; but if you have to trust to
children, you will soon find out what <i>that</i> is.
If they want anything of you, they know where
to find you; but if you want anything of them,
it’s no go.</p>

<p>“I think I made more money when first I
swept this crossing than I do now; it’s not a
<i>good</i> crossing, sir. Oh, no; but it’s handy
home, you see. When a shower of rain comes
on, I can run home, and needn’t go into a
public-house; but it’s a poor neighbourhood.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, indeed sir, I am always here.
Certainly; I am laid up sometimes for a day
with my feet. I am subject to the rheumatic
gout, you see. Well, I don’t know
whether so much standing has anything to do
with it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I <i>have</i> heard of what you call
‘shutting-up shop.’ I never heard it called
by that name before, though; but there’s lots
of sweepers as sweep back the dirt before
leaving at night. I know they do, some of
them. I never did it myself&mdash;I don’t care
about it; I always think there’s the trouble of
sweeping it back in the morning.</p>

<p>“People liberal? No, sir, I don’t think
there are many liberal people about; if people
were liberal I should make a good deal of
money.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, after I get home, I read a
book, if I can borrow one. What do I read?
Well, novels, when I can get them. What did
I read last night? Well, <i>Reynolds’s Miscellany</i>;
before that I read the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>.
I have read it three times over; but there’s
always something new in it.</p>

<p>“Well, weather makes very little difference
in this neighbourhood. My rent is two-and-sixpence
a-week. I have a little relief from
the parish. How much? Two-and-sixpence.
How much does my living cost? Well, I am
forced to live on what I can get. I manage
as well as I can; if I have a good week, I
spend it&mdash;I get more nourishment then,
that’s all.</p>

<p>“I used to smoke, sir, a great deal, but I
haven’t touched a pipe for a matter of forty
year. Yes, sir, I take snuff, Scotch and Rappee,
mixed. If I go without a meal of victuals,
I must have my snuff. I take an ounce
a-week, sir; it costs fourpence&mdash;that there is
the only luxury I get, unless somebody gives
me a half pint of beer.</p>

<p>“I very rarely get an odd job, this is not the
neighbourhood for them things.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I go to church on Sunday; I go
to All Souls’, in Langham-place, the church
with the sharp spire. I go in the morning;
once a day is quite enough for me. In the
afternoon, I generally take a walk in the Park,
or I go to see one of my young ones; they
won’t come to the old crossing-sweeper, so I
go to them.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">A Regent-street Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>A man who had stationed himself at the end
of Regent-street, near the County Fire Office,
gave me the following particulars.</p>

<p>He was a man far superior to the ordinary
run of sweepers, and, as will be seen, had
formerly been a gentleman’s servant. His
costume was of that peculiar miscellaneous
description which showed that it had from
time to time been given to him in charity. A
dress-coat so marvellously tight that the
stitches were stretching open, a waistcoat with
a remnant of embroidery, and a pair of trousers
which wrinkled like a groom’s top-boot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
had all evidently been part of the wardrobe
of the gentlemen whose errands he had run.
His boots were the most curious portion of
his toilette, for they were large enough for a
fisherman, and the portion unoccupied by
the foot had gone flat and turned up like a
Turkish slipper.</p>

<p>He spoke with a tone and manner which
showed some education. Once or twice whilst
I was listening to his statement he insisted
upon removing some dirt from my shoulder,
and, on leaving, he by force seized my hat
and brushed it&mdash;all which habits of attention
he had contracted whilst in service.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see stuck in the wristband
of his coat-sleeve a row of pins, arranged
as neatly as in the papers sold at the mercers’.</p>

<p>“Since the Irish have come so much&mdash;the
boys, I mean&mdash;my crossing has been completely
cut up,” he said; “and yet it is in as
good a spot as could well be, from the County
Fire Office (Mr. Beaumont as owns it) to
Swan and Edgar’s. It ought to be one of the
fust crossings in the kingdom, but these Irish
have spiled it.</p>

<p>“I should think, as far as I can guess, I’ve
been on it eight year, if not better; but it was
some time before I got known. You see, it
does a feller good to be some time on a crossing;
but it all depends, of course, whether you
are honest or not, for it’s according to your
honesty as you gets rewarded. By rewarded,
I means, you gets a character given to you by
word of mouth. For instance, a party wants
me to do a job for ’em, and they says, ‘Can
you get any lady or gentleman to speak for
you?’ And I says, ‘Yes;’ and I gets my character
by word of mouth&mdash;that’s what I calls
being rewarded.</p>

<p>“Before ever I took a broom in hand, the
good times had gone for crossings and sweepers.
The good times was thirty year back.
In the regular season, when <i>they</i> (the gentry)
are in town, I <i>have</i> taken from one and sixpence
to two shillings a-day; but every day’s
not alike, for people stop at home in wet days.
But, you see, in winter-time the crossings ain’t
no good, and then we turn off to shovelling
snow; so that, you see, a shilling a-day is
even too high for us to take regular all the
year round. Now, I ain’t taken a shilling, no,
nor a blessed bit of silver, for these three days.
All the quality’s out of town.</p>

<p>“It ain’t what a man gets on a crossing as
keeps him; <i>that</i> ain’t worth mentioning. I
don’t think I takes sixpence a-day regular&mdash;all
the year round, mind&mdash;on the crossing.
No, I’d take my solemn oath I don’t! If you
was to put down fourpence it would be nearer
the mark. I’ll tell you the use of a crossing
to such as me and my likes. It’s our shop,
and it ain’t what we gets a-sweeping, but it’s a
place like for us to stand, and then people as
wants us, comes and fetches us.</p>

<p>“In the summer I do a good deal in jobs. I do
anything in the portering line, or if I’m called
to do boots and shoes, or clean knives and
forks, then I does that. But that’s only when
people’s busy; for I’ve only got one regular
place I goes to, and that’s in <span class="lock">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> street, Piccadilly.
I goes messages, parcels, letters,
and anything that’s required, either for the
master of the hotel or the gents that uses
there. Now, there’s one party at Swan and
Edgar’s, and I goes to take parcels for him
sometimes; and he won’t trust anybody but
me, for you see I’m know’d to be trustworthy,
and then they reckons me as safe as the Bank,&mdash;there,
that’s just it.</p>

<p>“I got to the hotel only lately. You see,
when the peace was on and the soldiers was
coming home from the Crimmy, then the governor
he was exceeding busy, so he give me
two shillings a-day and my board; but that
wasn’t reg’lar, for as he wants me he comes
and fetches me. It’s a-nigh impossible to say
what I makes, it don’t turn out reg’lar; Sunday’s
a shilling or one-and-sixpence, other
days nothing at all&mdash;not salt to my porridge.
You see, when I helps the party at the hotel,
I gets my food, and that’s a lift. I’ve never
put down what I made in the course of the
year, but I’ve got enough to find food and raiment
for myself and family. Sir, I think I
may say I gets about six shillings a-week, but
it ain’t more.</p>

<p>“I’ve been abroad a good deal. I was in
Cape Town, Table Bay, one-and-twenty miles
from Simons’ Town&mdash;for you see the French
mans-of-war comes in at Cape Town, and the
English mans-of-war comes in at Simons’
Town. I was a gentleman’s servant over
there, and a very good place it was; and if
anybody was to have told me years back that
I was to have come to what I am now, I could
never have credited it; but misfortunes has
brought me to what I am.</p>

<p>“I come to England thinking to better
myself, if so be it was the opportunity; besides,
I was tired of Africy, and anxious to see
my native land.</p>

<p>“I was very hard up&mdash;ay, very hard up
indeed&mdash;before I took to the cross, and, in
preference to turning out dishonest, I says,
I’ll buy a broom and go and sweep and get a
honest livelihood.</p>

<p>“There was a Jewish lady and her husband
used to live in the Suckus, and I knowed them
and the family&mdash;very fine sons they was&mdash;and
I went into the shop to ask them to let me
work before the shop, and they give me their
permission so to do, and, says she, ‘I’ll allow
you threepence a-week.’ They’ve been good
friends to me, and send me a messages; and
wherever they be, may they do well, I says.</p>

<p>“I sometimes gets clothes give to me, but
it’s only at Christmas times, or after its over;
and that helps me along&mdash;it does so, indeed.</p>

<p>“Whenever I sees a pin or a needle, I picks
it up; sometimes I finds as many as a dozen
a-day, and I always sticks them either in my
cuff or in my waistcoat. Very often a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
sees ’em, and then they comes to me and says,
‘Can you oblige me with a pin?’ and I says,
‘Oh yes, marm; a couple, or three, if you
requires them;’ but it turns out very rare
that I gets a trifle for anything like that. I
only does it to be obliging&mdash;besides, it makes
you friends, like.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell who’s got the best crossing in
London. I’m no judge of that; it isn’t a
broom as can keep a man now. They’re going
out of town so fast, all the harristocracy;
though it’s middling classes&mdash;such as is in a
middling way like&mdash;as is the best friends to
me.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">A Tradesman’s Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>A man who had worked at crossing-sweeping
as a boy when he first came to London, and
again when he grew too old to do his work as
a labourer in a coal-yard, gave me a statement
of the kind of life he led, and the earnings he
made. He was an old man, with a forehead
so wrinkled that the dark, waved lines reminded
me of the grain of oak. His thick hair
was, despite his great age&mdash;which was nearly
seventy&mdash;still dark; and as he conversed with
me, he was continually taking off his hat, and
wiping his face with what appeared to be a
piece of flannel, about a foot square.</p>

<p>His costume was of what might be called
“the all-sorts” kind, and, from constant wear,
it had lost its original colour, and had turned
into a sort of dirty green-grey hue. It consisted
of a waistcoat of tweed, fastened together
with buttons of glass, metal, and bone;
a tail-coat, turned brown with weather, a pair
of trousers repaired here and there with big
stitches, like the teeth of a comb, and these
formed the extent of his wardrobe. Around
the collar of the coat and waistcoat, and on
the thighs of the pantaloons, the layers of
grease were so thick that the fibre of the cloth
was choked up, and it looked as if it had been
pieced with bits of leather.</p>

<p>Rubbing his unshorn chin, whereon the
bristles stood up like the pegs in the barrel of
a musical-box&mdash;until it made a noise like a
hair-brush, he began his <span class="lock">story:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’m known all about in Parliament-street&mdash;ay,
every bit about them parts,&mdash;for more
than thirty year. Ay, I’m as well known as
the statty itself, all about them parts at
Charing-cross. Afore I took to crossing-sweeping
I was at coal-work. The coal-work I
did was backing and filling, and anythink in
that way. I worked at Wood’s, and Penny’s,
and Douglas’s. They were good masters, Mr.
Wood ’specially; but the work was too much
for me as I got old. There was plenty of coal
work in them times; indeed, I’ve yearned as
much as nine shillings of a day. That was the
time as the meters was on. Now men can
hardly earn a living at coal-work. I left the
coal-work because I was took ill with a fever,
as was brought on by sweating&mdash;over-<i>exaction</i>
they called it. It left me so weak I wasn’t
able to do nothink in the yards.</p>

<p>“I know Mr. <span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>, the fishmonger, and
Mr. <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span>, the publican. I should think Mr.
<span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span> has knowed me this eight-and-thirty-year,
and they put me on to the crossing. You see,
when I was odd man at a coal job, I’d go and
do whatever there was to be done in the neighbourhood.
If there was anythink as Mr.
<span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s men couldn’t do&mdash;such as carrying
fish home to a customer, when the other men
were busy&mdash;I was sent for. Or Mr. <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span>
would send me with sperrits&mdash;a gallon, or half
a gallon, or anythink of that sort&mdash;a long
journey. In fact, I’d get anythink as come
handy.</p>

<p>“I had done crossing-sweeping as a boy,
before I took to coal-work, when I first come
out of the country. My own head first put me
up to the notion, and that’s more than fifty
year ago&mdash;ay, more than that; but I can’t call
to mind exactly, for I’ve had no parents ever
since I was eight year old, and now I’m nigh
seventy; but it’s as close as I can remember.
I was about thirteen at that time. There was
no police on then, and I saw a good bit of road
as was dirty, and says I, ‘That’s a good spot to
keep clean,’ and I took it. I used to go up to
the tops of the houses to throw over the snow,
and I’ve often been obliged to get men to help
me. I suppose I was about the first person
as ever swept a crossing in Charing-cross;
(here, as if proud of the fact, he gave a kind of
moist chuckle, which ended in a fit of coughing).
I used to make a good bit of money
then; but it ain’t worth nothink, now.</p>

<p>“After I left coal-backing, I went back to
the old crossing opposite the Adm’ralty gates,
and I stopped there until Mr. <span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> give me
the one I’m on now, and thank him for it, I
says. Mr. <span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> had the crossing paved, as
leads to his shop, to accommodate the customers.
He had a German there to sweep it
afore me. He used to sweep in the day&mdash;come
about ten or eleven o’clock in the morning,
and then at night he turned watchman;
for when there was any wenson, as Mr. <span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>
deals in, hanging out, he was put to watch it.
This German worked there, I reckon, about
seven year, and when he died I took the crossing.</p>

<p>“The crossing ain’t much of a living for
any body&mdash;that is, what I takes on it. But
then I’ve got regular customers as gives me
money. There’s Mr. <span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span>, he gives a shilling
a-week; and there’s Captain <span class="lock">R&mdash;&mdash;</span>, of
the Adm’ralty, he gives me sixpence a fortnight;
and another captain, of the name of
<span class="lock">R&mdash;&mdash;</span>, he gives me fourpence every Sunday.
Ah! I’d forgot Mr. <span class="lock">O&mdash;&mdash;</span>, the Secretary at the
Adm’ralty; he gives me sixpence now and
then. Besides, I do a lot of odd jobs for different
people; they knows where to come and
find me when they wants me. They gets me
to carry letters, or a parcel, or a box, or anythink
of that there. I has a bit of vittals, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
give me every now and then; but as for
money, it’s very little as I get on the crossings&mdash;perhaps
seven or eight shilling a-week,
reg’lar customers and all.</p>

<p>“I never heard of anybody as was leaving a
crossing selling it; no, never. My crossing
ain’t a reg’lar one as anybody could have. If
I was to leave, it depends upon whether Mr.
<span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> would like to have the party, as to who
gets it. There’s no such thing as turning a
reg’lar sweeper out, the police stops that. I’ve
been known to them for years, and they are
very kind to me. As they come’s by they says,
‘Jimmy, how are you?’ You see, my crossing
comes handy for them, for it’s agin Scotland-yard;
and when they turns out in their clean
boots it saves their blacking.</p>

<p>“Lord <span class="lock">G&mdash;&mdash;</span> used to be at the Adm’ralty,
but he ain’t there now; I don’t know why he
left, but he’s gone. He used to give me sixpence
every now and then when he come over.
I was near to my crossing when Mr. Drummond
was shot, but I wasn’t near enough to
hear the pistol; but I didn’t see nothink. I
know’d the late Sir Robert Peel, oh, certantly,
but he seldom crossed over my crossing,
though whenever he did, he’d give me somethink.
The present Sir Robert goes over to
the chapel in Spring-gardens when he’s in
town, but he keeps on the other side of the
way; so I never had anythink from him. He’s
the very picture of his father, and I knows him
from that, only his father were rather stouter
than he is. I don’t know none of the members
of parliament, they most on ’em keeps on
shifting so, that I hasn’t no time to recognise
’em.</p>

<p>“The watering-carts ain’t no friends of
our’n. They makes dirt and no pay for cleaning
it. There’s so much traffic with coaches
and carts going right over my crossing that a
fine or wet day don’t make much difference to
me, for people are afraid to cross for fear of
being run over. I’m forced to have my eyes
about me and dodge the wehicles. I never
heerd, as I can tell on, of a crossing-sweeper
being run over.”</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap">The Able-bodied Female Crossing-Sweepers.</span></h4>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Old Woman “over the Water.</span>”</h5>

<p>She is the widow of a sweep&mdash;“as respectable
and ’dustrious a man,” I was told, “as any in
the neighbourhood of the ‘Borough;’ he was
a short man, sir,&mdash;very short,” said my informant,
“and had a weakness for top-boots,
white hats, and leather breeches,” and in that
unsweeplike costume he would parade himself
up and down the Dover and New Kent-roads.
He had a capital connexion (or, as
his widow terms it, “seat of business”), and
left behind him a good name and reputation
that would have kept the “seat of business”
together, if it had not been for the misconduct
of the children, two of whom (sons) have been
transported, while a daughter “went wrong,”
though she, wretched creature, paid a fearful
penalty, I learnt, for her frailties, having been
burnt to death in the middle of the night,
through a careless habit of smoking in bed.</p>

<p>The old sweeper herself, eighty years of age,
and almost beyond labour, very deaf, and
rather feeble to all appearance, yet manages to
get out every morning between four and five,
so as to catch the workmen and “time-keepers”
on their way to the factories. She
has the true obsequious curtsey, but is said to
be very strong in her “likes and dislikes.”</p>

<p>She bears a good character, though sometimes
inclining, I was informed, towards
“the other half-pint,” but never guilty of any
excess. She is somewhat profuse in her
scriptural ejaculations and professions of gratitude.
Her statement was as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Fifteen years I’ve been on the crossing,
come next Christmas. My husband died in
Guy’s Hospital, of the cholera, three days
after he got in, and I took to the crossing some
time after. I had nothing to do. I am eighty
years of age, and I couldn’t do hard work. I
have nothing but what the great God above
pleases to give me. The poor woman who
had the crossing before me was killed, and
so I took it. The gentleman who was the
foreman of the road, gave me the grant to take
it. I didn’t ask him, for poor people as wants
a bit of bread they goes on the crossings as
they likes, but he never interfered with me.
The first day I took sixpence; but them good
times is all gone, they’ll never come back
again. The best times I used to take a
shilling a-day, and now I don’t take but a few
pence. The winter is as bad as the summer,
for poor people haven’t got it to give, and gentlefolks
get very near now. People are not so
liberal as they used to be, and they never will
be again.</p>

<p>“To do a hard day’s washing, I couldn’t. I
used to go to a lady’s house to do a bit of washing
when I had my strength, but I can’t do it
now.</p>

<p>“People going to their offices at six or seven
in the morning gives me a ha’penny or a
penny; if they don’t, I must go without it. I
go at five, and stand there till eleven or twelve,
till I find it is no use being there any longer.
Oh, the gentlemen give me the most, I’m sure;
the ladies don’t give me nothing.</p>

<p>“At Christmas I get a few things&mdash;a gentleman
gave me these boots I’ve got on, and a
ticket for a half-quartern loaf and a hundred of
coals. I have got as much as five shillings
at Christmas&mdash;but those times will never come
back again. I get no more than two shillings
and sixpence at Christmas now.</p>

<p>“My husband, Thomas &mdash;&mdash; was his name,
was a chimley-sweep. He did a very good
business&mdash;it was all done by his sons. We
had a boy with us, too, just as a friendly boy.
I was a mother and a mistress to him. I’ve
had eleven children. I’m grandmother to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
fifteen, and a great-grandmother, too. They
won’t give me a bite of bread, though, any of
’em, I’ve got four children living, as far as I
know, two abroad and two home here with
families. I never go among ’em. It is not in
my power to assist ’em, so I never go to distress
’em.</p>

<p>“I get two shilling a-week from the parish,
and I have to pay out of that for a quartern
loaf, a quartern of sugar, and an ounce of tea.
The parish forces it on me, so I must take it,
and that only leaves me one shilling and fourpence.
A shilling of it goes for my lodging.
I lodge with people who knew my family and
me, and took a liking to me; they let me come
there instead of wandering about the streets.</p>

<p>“I stand on my crossing till I’m like to
drop over my broom with tiredness. Yes, sir,
I go to church at St. George’s in the Borough.
I go there every Sunday morning, after I leave
my roads. They’ve taken the organ and
charity children away that used to be there
when I was a girl, so it’s not a church now, it’s
a chapel. There’s nothing but the preacher
and the gentlefolks, and they sings their own
psalms. There are gatherings at that church,
but whether it’s for the poor or not I don’t
know. <i>I</i> don’t get any of it.</p>

<p>“It was a great loss to me when my husband
died; I went all to ruin then. My father belonged
to Scotland, at Edinboro’. My mother
came from Yorkshire. I don’t know where
Scotland is no more than the dead. My father
was a gentleman’s gardener and watchman. My
mother used to go out a-chairing, and she was
drowned just by Horsemonger Lane. She was
coming through the Halfpenny Hatch, that
used to be just facing the Crown and Anchor,
in the New Kent-road; there was an open
ditch there, sir. She took the left-hand turning
instead of the right, and was drownded.
My father died in St. Martin’s Workhouse.
He died of apoplexy fit.</p>

<p>“I used to mind my father’s place till mother
died. His housekeeper I was&mdash;God help me!
a fine one too. Thank the Lord, my husband
was a clever man; he had a good seat of business.
I lost my right hand when he died. I
couldn’t carry it on. There was my two sons
went for sogers, and the others were above
their business. He left a seat of business
worth a hundred pound; he served all up the
New Kent-road. He was beloved by all his
people. He used to climb himself when I first
had him, but he left it off when he got children.
I had my husband when I was fifteen, and
kept him forty years. Ah! he was well-beloved
by all around, except his children, and they
behaved shameful. I said to his eldest son,
when he lay in the hospital, (asking your pardon,
sir, for mentioning it)&mdash;I says to his
eldest son, ‘Billy,’ says I, ‘your father’s very
bad&mdash;why don’t you go to see him?’ ‘Oh,’
says he, ‘he’s all right, he’s gettin’ better;’
and he was never the one to go and see him
once; and he never come to the funeral.</p>

<p>“Billy thought I should come upon him
after his death, but I never troubled him for
as much as a crumb of bread.</p>

<p>“I never get spoken to on my roads, only
some people say, ‘Good morning,’ ‘There you
are, old lady.’ They never asks me no questions
whatsomever. I never get run over, though I
am very hard of hearing; but I am forced to
have my eyes here, there, and everywhere, to
keep out of the way of the carts and coaches.</p>

<p>“Some days I goes to my crossing, and earns
nothink at all: other days it’s sometimes fourpence,
sometimes sixpence. I earned fourpence
to-day, and I had a bit of snuff out of it.
Why, I believe I did yearn fivepence yesterday&mdash;I
won’t tell no story. I got ninepence on
Sunday&mdash;that was a good day; but, God knows,
that didn’t go far. I yearned so much I
couldn’t bring it home on Saturday&mdash;it almost
makes me laugh,&mdash;I yearned sixpence.</p>

<p>“I goes every morning, winter or summer,
frost or snow; and at the same hour (five
o’clock); people certainly don’t think of giving
so much in fine weather. Nobody ever mislested
me, and I never mislested nobody. If
they gives me a penny, I thanks ’em; and if
they gives me nothing, I thanks ’em all the
same.</p>

<p>“If I was to go into the House, I shouldn’t
live three days. It’s not that I eat much&mdash;a
very little is enough for me; but it’s the air I
should miss: to be shut up like a thief, I
couldn’t live long, I know.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Old Woman Crossing-Sweeper who
had a Pensioner.</span></h5>

<p>This old dame is remarkable from the fact
of being the chief support of a poor deaf
cripple, who is as much poorer than the crossing-sweeper
as she is poorer than Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,
in &mdash;&mdash; street, who allows the sweeper sixpence
a-week. The crossing-sweeper is a rather stout
old woman, with a carneying tone, and constant
curtsey. She complains, in common with
most of her class, of the present hard times,
and reverts longingly to the good old days when
people were more liberal than they are now,
and had more to give. She <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was on my crossing before the police
was made, for I am not able to work, and only
get helped by the people who knows me.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, in the square, gives me a shilling
a-week; Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, in &mdash;&mdash; street, gives me
sixpence; (she has gone in the country now,
but she has left it at the oil-shop for me);
that’s what I depinds upon, darlin’, to help
pay my rent, which is half-a-crown. My rent
was three shillings, till the landlord didn’t wish
me to go, ’cause I was so punctual with my
money. I give a corner of my room to a
poor cretur, who’s deaf as a beadle; she
works at the soldiers’ coats, and is a very good
hand at it, and would earn a good deal of
money if she had constant work. She owed
as good as twelve shillings and sixpence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
rent, poor thing, where she was last, and the
landlord took all her goods except her bed;
she’s got that, so I give her a corner of
my room for charity’s sake. We must look
to one another: she’s as poor as a church
mouse. I thought she would be company
for me, still a deaf person is but poor company
to one. She had that heavy sickness they
call the cholera about five years ago, and it
fell in her side and in the side of her head
too&mdash;that made her deaf. Oh! she’s a poor
object. She has been with me since the
month of February. I’ve lent her money out
of my own pocket. I give her a cup of tea
or a slice of bread when I see she hasn’t got
any. Then the people up-stairs are kind to
her, and give her a bite and a sup.</p>

<p>“My husband was a soldier; he fought at
the battle of Waterloo. His pension was
ninepence a-day. All my family are dead,
except my grandson, what’s in New Orleans.
I expect him back this very month that now
we have: he gave me four pounds before he
went, to carry me over the last winter.</p>

<p>“If the Almighty God pleases to send him
back, he’ll be a great help to me. He’s all
I’ve got left. I never had but two children in
all my life.</p>

<p>“I worked in noblemen’s houses before I
was married to my husband, who is dead;
but he came to be poor, and I had to leave
my houses where I used to work.</p>

<p>“I took twopence-halfpenny yesterday, and
threepence to-day; the day before yesterday I
didn’t take a penny. I never come out on
Sunday; I goes to Rosomon-street Chapel.
Last Saturday I made one shilling and sixpence;
on Friday, sixpence. I dare say I
make three shillings and sixpence a-week,
besides the one shilling and sixpence I gets
allowed me. I am forced to make a do of it
somehow, but I’ve no more strength left in
me than this ould broom.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Crossing-Sweeper who had been
a Servant-Maid.</span></h5>

<p>She is to be found any day between eight in
the morning and seven in the evening, sweeping
away in a convulsive, jerky sort of manner,
close to &mdash;&mdash; square, near the Foundling. She
may be known by her pinched-up straw bonnet,
with a broad, faded, almost colourless ribbon.
She has weak eyes, and wears over them a
brownish shade. Her face is tied up, because
of a gathering which she has on her head.
She wears a small, old plaid cloak, a clean
checked apron, and a tidy printed gown.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE CROSSING-SWEEPER THAT HAS BEEN A MAID-SERVANT.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>She is rather shy at first, but willing and
obliging enough withal; and she lives down
Little &mdash;&mdash; Yard, in Great &mdash;&mdash; street. The
“yard” that is made like a mousetrap&mdash;small
at the entrance, but amazingly large inside,
and dilapidated though extensive.</p>

<p>Here are stables and a couple of blind
alleys, nameless, or bearing the same name as
the yard itself, and wherein are huddled more
people than one could count in a quarter of
an hour, and more children than one likes to
remember,&mdash;dirty children, listlessly trailing
an old tin baking-dish, or a worn-out shoe, tied
to a piece of string; sullen children, who turn
away in a fit of sleepy anger if spoken to;
screaming children, setting all the parents in
the “yard” at defiance; and quiet children,
who are arranging banquets of dirt in the
reeking gutters.</p>

<p>The “yard” is devoted principally to costermongers.</p>

<p>The crossing-sweeper lives in the top-room
of a two-storied house, in the very depth of
the blind alley at the end of the yard. She
has not even a room to herself, but pays one
shilling a-week for the privilege of sleeping
with a woman who gets her living by selling
tapes in the streets.</p>

<p>“Ah!” says the sweeper, “poor woman, she
<i>has</i> a hard time of it; her husband is in the
hospital with a bad leg&mdash;in fact, he’s scarcely
ever out. If you could hear that woman
cough, you’d never forget it. She would have
had to starve to-day if it hadn’t been for a
person who actually lent her a gown to pledge
to raise her stock-money, poor thing.”</p>

<p>The room in which these people live has a
sloping roof, and a small-paned window on
each side. For furniture, there were two chairs
and a shaky, three-legged stool, a deal table,
and a bed rolled up against the wall&mdash;nothing
else. In one corner of the room lay the last
lump remaining of the seven pounds of coals.
In another corner there were herbs in pans,
and two water-bottles without their noses. The
most striking thing in that little room was
some crockery, the woman had managed to
save from the wreck of her things; among
this, curiously enough, was a soup-tureen,
with its lid not even cracked.</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a piece of looking-glass&mdash;a small
three-cornered piece&mdash;forming an almost equilateral
triangle,&mdash;and the oldest, and most
rubbed and worn-out piece of a mirror that
ever escaped the dust-bin.</p>

<p>The fireplace was a very small one, and on
the table were two or three potatoes and about
one-fifth of a red herring, which the poor
street-seller had saved out of her breakfast to
serve for her supper. “Take my solemn word
for it, sir,” said the sweeper, “and I wouldn’t
deceive you, that is all she will get besides a
cup of weak tea when she comes home tired
at night.”</p>

<p>The statement of this old sweeper is as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My name is Mary &mdash;&mdash;. I live in &mdash;&mdash;
yard. I live with a person of the name of
&mdash;&mdash;, in the back attic; she gets her living by
selling flowers in pots in the street, but she is
now doing badly. I pay her a shilling a-week.</p>

<p>“My parents were Welsh. I was in service,
or maid-of-all-work, till I got married. My
husband was a seafaring man when I married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
him. After we were married, he got his living
by selling memorandum-almanack books, and
the like, about the streets. He was driven to
that because he had no trade in his hand, and
he was obliged to do something for a living.
He did not make much, and over-exertion,
with want of nourishment, brought on a paralytic
stroke. He had the first fit about two
years before he had the second; the third fit,
which was the last, he had on the Monday,
and died on the Wednesday week. I have two
children still living. One of them is married
to a poor man, who gets his living in the
streets; but as far as lays in his power he
makes a good husband and father. My other
daughter is living with a niece of mine, for I
can’t keep her, sir; she minds the children.</p>

<p>“My father was a journeyman shoemaker.
He was killed; but I cannot remember how&mdash;I
was too young. I can’t recollect my mother.
I was brought up by an uncle and aunt till I
was able to go to service. I went out to service
at five, to mind children under a nurse, and I
was in service till I got married. I had a great
many situations; you see, sir, I was forced to
keep in place, because I had nowhere to go to,
my uncle and aunt not being able to keep me.
I was never in noblemen’s families, only trades-people’s.
Service was very hard, sir, and so I
believe it continues.</p>

<p>“I am fifty-five years of age, and I have been
on the crossing fourteen years; but just now
it is very poor work indeed. Well, if I wishes
for bad weather, I’m only like other people, I
suppose. I have no regular customers at all;
the only one I had left has lost his senses, sir.
Mr. <span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, he used to allow us sixpence
a-week; but he went mad, and we don’t get it
now. By us, I mean the three crossing-sweepers
in the square where I work.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I like the winter-time, for the
families is in. Though the weather is more
severe, yet you <i>do</i> get a few more ha’pence. I
take more from the staid elderly people than
from the young. At Christmas, I think I took
about eleven shillings, but certainly not more.
The most I ever made at that season was fourteen
shillings. The worst about Christmas is,
that those who give much then generally hold
their hand for a week or two.</p>

<p>“A shilling a-day would be as much as I
want, sir. I have stood in the square all day
for a ha’penny, and I have stood here for nothing.
One week with another, I make two
shillings in the seven days, after paying for
my broom. I have taken threppence ha’penny
to-day. Yesterday&mdash;let me see&mdash;well, it was
threppence ha’penny, too; Monday I don’t remember;
but Sunday I recollect&mdash;it was fippence
ha’penny. Years ago I made a great
deal more&mdash;nearly three times as much.</p>

<p>“I come about eight o’clock in the morning,
and go away about six or seven; I am here
every day. The boys used to come at one time
with their brooms, but they’re not allowed here
now by the police.</p>

<p>“I should not think crossings worth purchasing,
unless people made a better living on
them than I do.”</p>

<p>I gave the poor creature a small piece of
silver for her trouble, and asked her if that,
with the threepence halfpenny, made a good
day. She answered <span class="lock">heartily&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I should like to see such another day to-morrow,
sir.</p>

<p>“Yes, winter is very much better than summer,
only for the trial of standing in the frost
and snow, but we certainly <i>do</i> get more then.
The families won’t be in town for three months
to come yet. Ah! this neighbourhood is nothing
to what it was. By God’s removal, and
by their own removal, the good families are
all gone. The present families are not so
liberal nor so wealthy. It is not the richest
people that give the most. Tradespeople, and
’specially gentlefolks who have situations, are
better to me than the nobleman who rides in
his carriage.</p>

<p>“I always go to Trinity Church, Gray’s-inn-road,
about two doors from the Welsh School&mdash;the
Rev. Dr. Witherington preaches there.
I always go on Sunday afternoon and evening,
for I can’t go in the morning; I can’t get
away from my crossing in time. I never omit
a day in coming here, unless I’m ill, or the
snow is too heavy, or the weather too bad, and
then I’m obligated to resign.</p>

<p>“I have no friends, sir, only my children;
my uncle and aunt have been dead a long time.
I go to see my children on Sunday, or in the
evening, when I leave here.</p>

<p>“After I leave I have a cup of tea, and after
that I go to bed; very frequently I’m in bed at
nine o’clock. I have my cup of tea if I can
anyway get it; but I’m forced to go without
<i>that</i> sometimes.</p>

<p>“When my sight was better, I used to be
very partial to reading; but I can’t see the
print, sir, now. I used to read the Bible, and
the newspaper. Story-books I have read, too,
but not many novels. Yes, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> I
know, but not the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. I’ve
heard of it; they tell me it is a very interesting
book to read, but I never had it. We never
have any ladies or Scripture-readers come to
our lodgings; you see, we’re so out, they might
come a dozen times and not find us at home.</p>

<p>“I wear out three brooms in a-week; but
in the summer one will last a fortnight. I
give threepence ha’penny for them; there are
twopenny-ha’penny brooms, but they are not
so good, they are liable to have their handles
come out. It is very fatiguing standing so many
hours; my legs aches with pain, and swells.
I was once in Middlesex Hospital for sixteen
weeks with my legs. My eyes have been weak
from a child. I have got a gathering in my
head from catching cold standing on the crossing.
I had the fever this time twelvemonth.
I laid a fortnight and four days at home, and
seven weeks in the hospital. I took the diarrhœa
after that, and was six weeks under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
doctor’s hands. I used to do odd jobs, but my
health won’t permit me now. I used to make
two or three shillings a-week by ’em, and get
scraps and things. But I get no broken victuals
now.</p>

<p>“I never get anything from servants; they
don’t get more than they know what to do
with.</p>

<p>“I don’t get a drop of beer once in a month.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what this being out may
be the best thing, after all; for if I was at
home all my time, it would not agree with
me.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Statement of “Old John,” the Waterman
at the Farringdon-street Cab-stand, concerning
the Old Black Crossing-Sweeper
who left £800 to Miss Waithman.</span></h5>

<p>“Yes, sir, I knew him for many year, though
I never spoke to him in all my life. He was
a stoutish, thickset man, about my build, and
used to walk with his broom up and down&mdash;so.”</p>

<p>Here “Old John” imitated the halt and stoop
of an old man.</p>

<p>“He used to touch his hat continually,” he
went on. “‘Please remember the poor black
man,’ was his cry, never anything else. Oh
yes, he made a great deal of money. People
gave more then than they do now. Where they
give one sixpence now, they <i>used</i> to give ten.
It’s just the same by our calling. Lived
humbly? Yes, I think he did; at all events,
he seemed to do so when he was on his crossing.
He got plenty of odds-and-ends from
the corner <i>there</i>&mdash;Alderman Waithman’s, I
mean; he was a very sober, quiet sort of man.
No, sir, nothing peculiar in his dress. Some
blacks are peculiar in their dress; but he
would wear anything he could get give him.
They used to call him Romeo, I think. Cur’ous
name, sir; but the best man I ever knew
was called Romeo, and he was a black.</p>

<p>“The crossing-sweeper had his regular customers;
he knew their times, and was there
to the moment. Oh yes, he was always. Hail,
rain, or snow, he never missed. I don’t know
how long he had the crossing. I remember
him ever since I was a postboy in Doctors’
Commons; I knew him when I lived in Holborn,
and I haven’t been away from this neighbourhood
since 1809.</p>

<p>“No, sir, there’s no doubt about his leaving
the money to Miss Waithman. Everybody
round about here knows it; just ask them, sir.
Miss Waithman (an old maid she were, sir)
used to be very kind to him. He used to
sweep from Alderman Waithman’s (it’s the
<i>Sunday Times</i> now) across to the opposite side
of the way.</p>

<p>“When he died, an old man, as had been a
soldier, took possession of the crossing. How
did he get it? Why, I say, he <i>took it</i>. First
come, first sarved, sir; that’s their way. They
never sell crossings. Sometimes (for a lark)
they shift, and then one stands treat&mdash;a gallon
of beer, or something of that sort. The
perlice interfered with the soldier&mdash;you know
the sweepers is all forced to go if the perlice
interfere; now with us, sir, we are licensed,
and they can’t make us move on. They interfered,
I say, with the old soldier, because he
used to get so drunk. Why, at a public-house
close at hand, he would spent seven, eight,
and ten shillings on a night, three or four
days together. He used to gather so many
blackguards round the crossing, they were
forced to move him at last. A young man has
got it now; he has had it three year. He is
not always here, sometimes away for a week at
a stretch; but, you see, he knows the best
times to come, and then he is <i>sure</i> to be here.
The little boys come with their brooms now
and then, but the perlice always drive them
away.”</p>

<p>This man, a native of “County Corruk,” has

He wears a close-fitting black cloth cap over
a shock of reddish hair; round his neck he

advertised as “Imitation Silk.” His black

whatever is offered him. He is unassuming

<div class="caption"><p>THE IRISH CROSSING-SWEEPER.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Photograph.</i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I’ve been at this crossin’ near upon two year.
Whin I first come over to England (about two
years and a half ago), I wint a haymakin’,
but, you see, I couldn’t get any work; and
afther thrampin’ about a good bit, why my
eyesight gettin’ very wake, and I not knowin’
what to do, I took this crossin’.</p>

<p>“How did I get it?&mdash;Will, sir, I wint walkin’
about and saw it, and nobody on it. So one
mornin’ I brought a broom wid me and stood
here. Yes, sir, I <i>was</i> intherfered wid. The
man with one arm&mdash;a Switzer they calls him&mdash;he
had had the crossin’ on Sundays for a
long while gone, and he didn’t like my bein’
here at all, at all. ‘<span class="lock">B&mdash;&mdash;y</span> Irish’ he used to
call me, and other scandalizin’ names; and
he and the swatestuff man opposite, who was
a friend of his, tried everythin’ they could to
git me off the crossin’. But sure I niver
harrumed them at all, at all.</p>

<p>“Yis, sir, I have my rigular custhomers:
there’s Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, he’s gone to Sydenham; he’s
very kind, sir. He gives me a shilling a-month.
He left worrud with the sarvint
while he’s away to give me a shilling on the
first day in every month. He gave me a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
to the Eye Hospital, in Goulden Square, because
of the wakeness of my eyesight; but
they’ll niver cure it at all, at all, sir, for wake
eyes runs in my family. My sister, sir, has
wake eyes; she is working at Croydon.</p>

<p>“Oh no, indeed, and it isn’t the gintlefolks
that thry to get me off the crossin’; they’d
rather shupport me, sir. But the poor payple
it is that don’t like me.</p>

<p>“Eighteenpince I’ve made in a day, and
more: niver more than two shillings, and
sometimes not sixpence. Will, sir, I am not
like the others; I don’t run afther the ladies
and gintlemen&mdash;I don’t persevere. Yestherday
I took sixpence, by chance, for takin’ some
luggage for a lady. The day before yestherday
I took three ha’pence; but I think I got
somethin’ else for a bit of worruk thin.</p>

<p>“Yes, winther is better than summer. I
don’t know which people is the most liberal.
Sure, sir, I don’t think there’s much difference.
Oh yes, sir, young men are very liberal
sometimes, and so are young ladies. Perhaps
old ladies or old gintlemen give the most at a
time,&mdash;sometimes sixpence,&mdash;perhaps more;
but thin, sir, you don’t git anything else for a
long time.</p>

<p>“The boy-sweepers annoy me very much,
indeed; they use such scandalizin’ worruds
to me, and throw dirrut, they do. They
know whin the police is out of the way, so I
git no purtiction.</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, and I think it right that ivery
person should attind the worruship to which
he belongs. I am a Catholic, sir, and attind
mass at St. Pathrick’s, near St. Giles’s, ivery
Sunday, and I thry to be at confission wonst a
month.</p>

<p>“Whin first I took to the crossin’, I was
rather irrigular; but that was because of the
Switzer man&mdash;that’s the man with the one
arm; he used to say he would lock me up,
and iverything. But I have been rigular
since.</p>

<p>“I come in the morruning just before
eight, in time to catch the gintlefolks going
into prayers; and I leave at half-past seven
to eight at night. I wait so late because I
have to bring a gintleman wather for his
flowers, and that I do the last thing.</p>

<p>“I live, sir, in &mdash;&mdash; lane, behind St. Giles’s
Church, in the first-flure front, sir; and I pay
one-and-threepence a-week. There are three
bids in the room. In one bid, a man, his
wife, his mother, and their little girl&mdash;Julia,
they call her&mdash;sleep; in the other bid, there’s
a man and his wife and child. Yes, I am
single, and have the third bid to myself. I
come from County Corruk; the others in the
room are all Irish, and come from County
Corruk too. They sill fruit in the sthreet;
in the winther they sill onions, and sometimes
oranges.</p>

<p>“There a Scotch gintleman as brings me
my breakfast every morning; indeed, yes, and
he brings it himself, he does. He has gone
to Scotland now, but he will be back in a
week. He brings me some bread and mate,
and a pinny for a half pint of beer, sir. He
has done it almost all the time I have been
here.</p>

<p>“The Switzer man, sir, took out boards for
the <i>Polytickner</i>, or some place like that. He
got fifteen shillings a-week, and used to come
here on Sundays. Yes, sir, <i>I</i> come here on
Sundays; but it is not better than other days.
Some people says to me, they would rather I
went to church; but I tells ’em I do; and
sure, sir, afther mass, there’s no harrum in a
little sweepin’ between whiles.</p>

<p>“No, sir, there’s not a crossin’-sweeper in
Ould Ireland. Well, sir, I niver was in Dublin;
but I’ve been in Corruk, sir, and they
don’t have any crossin’ sweepers there.</p>

<p>“Whin I git home of a night, sir, I am
very tired; but I always offer up my devotions
before sleepin’. Ah, sir, I should niver have
swipt crossin’s if a friend of mine hadn’t died;
he was collector of tolls in Clarnykilts, and I
used to be with him. He lost his situation,
and so I came to England.</p>

<p>“The Switzer man, I think he used to sweep
at eight o’clock, just as the people were goin’
to prayers. Oh, sir, he was always black-geyardin’
me. ‘Go back to your own counthry,’
says he&mdash;a furriner himsilf, too.</p>

<p>“Will, yes sir, I do wish for bad weather;
a good wit day, and a dry day afther, is the
best.</p>

<p>“Sure and they can’t turn me off my crossin’
only for my bad conduct, and I thry to be
quiet and take no notice.</p>

<p>“Yis, sir, I have always been a church-goer,
and I am seventy-five. I used to have some
good rigular customers, but somehow I haven’t
seen anythin’ of them for this last twelvemonth.
Ah! it’s in the betther neighbourhoods
that people give rigularly. I niver get
any broken victuals. Three-and-sixpence is
the outside of my earnings, taking one week
with the other.</p>

<p>“What is the laste I ever took? Will, sir,
for three days I haven’t taken a farthin’. The
worust week I iver had was thirteen or fourteen
pence altogether; the best week I iver
had was the winter before last&mdash;that harrud
winter, sir, I remember takin’ seven shillings
thin; but the man at Portman-square makes
the most.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I belave there’s some of every
nation in the world as sweeps crossin’s in
London.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Female Irish Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>In a street not far from Gordon-square and
the New-road, I found this poor old woman
resting from her daily labour. She was sitting
on the stone ledge of the iron railings at
the corner of the street, huddled up in the
way seemingly natural to old Irishwomen, her
broom hidden as much as possible under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
petticoats. Her shawl was as tidy as possible
for its age. She was sixty-seven years, and
had buried two husbands and five children,
fractured her ribs, and injured her groin, and
had nothing left to comfort her but her crossing,
her ha’porth of snuff, and her “drop of
biled wather,” by which name she indicated
her “tay.”</p>

<p>She was very civil and intelligent, and answered
my inquiries very readily, and with
rather less circumlocution than the Irish
generally display. She seemed much hurt at
the closing of the Old St. Pancras churchyard.
“They buried my child where they’ll never
bury me, sir,” she cried.</p>

<p>She told the story of her accident with
many involuntary movements of her hand towards
the injured part, and took a sparing
pinch of snuff from a little black snuff-box,
inlaid with mother-of-pearl, for which she
said she had given a penny. She proceeded
thus:&mdash;“I’m an Irishwoman, sir, and it’s from
Kinsale I come, twelve miles beyond Corruk,
to the left-hand side, a seaport town, and a
great place for fish. It’s fifty years the sixteenth
of last June since I came in St. Giles’s
parish, and there my ildest child wint
did. Buried she is in Ould St. Pancras
churchyarrud, where they’ll never bury me,
sir, for they’ve done away with burying in
churchyarruds. That girl was forty-one year
of age the seventeenth of last February,
born in Stratford, below Bow, in Essex. Ah!
I was comfortable there; I lived there three
year and abouts. I was in sarvice at Mr. <span class="lock">&mdash;&mdash;’s,</span>
a Frinch gintleman he was, and kept a school,
where they taught Frinch and English both;
but I dare say they are all gone did years ago.
He was a very ould gintleman, and so was his
lady; she was a North-of-England lady, but
very stout, and had no children but a son and
daughter. I was quite young when my aunt
brought me over. My uncle was three year
here before my aunt, and he died at Whitechapel.
I was bechuxt sixteen and seventeen
when I come over, and I reckon meself at
sixty-seven come next Christmas, as well as I
can guess. I never had a mother, sir; she
died when I was only six months old. My
father, sir, was maltster to Mr. Walker the distiller,
in Corruk. Ah! indeed, and my father
was well to do wonst. Early or late, wit or
dry, he had a guinea a-week, but he worruked
day and night; he was to attind to the corun,
and he would have four min, or five or six,
undther him, according as busy they might
be. My father has been did four-and-twinty
year, and I wouldn’t know a crature if I wint
home. Father come over, sir, and wanted me
to go back very bad, but I wouldn’t. I was
married thin, and had buried some of my
childer in St. Pancras; and for what should
I lave England?</p>

<p>“Oh! sir, I buried three in eight months,&mdash;two
sons and their father. My husband was
two year and tin months keeping his bed; he
has been did fifteen years to the eighth of last
March; but I’ve been married again.</p>

<p>“Siven childer I’ve had, and ounly two
alive, and they’ve got enough to do to manage
for thimsilves. The boy, he follers the market,
and my daughter, she is along with her
husband; sure he sills in the streets, sir. I
see very little of her,&mdash;she lives over in the
Borough.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll be afther going down to Kent,
beyant Maidstone, a hop-picking, if I can git
as much as to take me down the road.</p>

<p>“My daughter’s husband and me don’t agree,
so I’m bitter not to see them.</p>

<p>“Ivery day, sir&mdash;ivery day in the week I
am here. This morunning I was here at eight&mdash;that
was earlier than usual, but I came out
because I had not broke my fast with anything
but a drop of wather, and that I had two tumblers
of it from the house at the corrunner.
I intind to go home and take two hirrings,
and have a drop of biled wather&mdash;tay, I mane,
sir.</p>

<p>“I come here at about half-past nine to
half-past ten, but I’m gitting a very bad leg.
I goes home about five or six.</p>

<p>“I have taken two ha’pennies this morning;
thruppence I took yisterday; the day before I
took, I think, fourpence ha’penny; that was my
taking on Monday; on Sunday I mustered a
shilling; on Saturday&mdash;I declare, sir, I forgit&mdash;fourpence
or thruppence, I suppose, but my
frinds is out of town very much. They gives
me a penny rigular every Sunday, or a ha’penny,
and some tuppence. Of a Sunday in the good
time I may take eighteenpence or sixteenpence.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of Christmas it’s better, it is&mdash;four
or five shillings on a Christmas-day.</p>

<p>“On the Monday fortnight, before last
Christmas twelvemonth, I had two ribs broke,
and one fractured, and my grine (groin) bone
injured. Oh! the pains that I feel even now,
sir. I lived then in Phillip’s-gardens, up there
in the New-road. The policeman took me to
the hospital. It was eighteen days I niver
got off my bid. I came out in the morunning
of the Christmas-eve. I hild on by the railings
as I wint along, and I thought I niver
should git home. How I was knocked down
was by a cart; I had my eye bad thin, the lift
one, and had a cloth over it. I was just comin’
out of the archway of the courrut (close by
the beer-shop) away from Mr. <span class="lock">&mdash;&mdash;’s</span> house,
when crossing to the green-grocer’s to git two
pound of praties for my supper, I didn’t see
the cart comin’. I was knocked down by the
shaft. They called, and they called, and he
wouldn’t stop, and it wint over me, it did. It
was loaded with cloth; I don’t know if it wasn’t
a Shoolbred’s cart, but the boy said to the hospital-doctor
and to the policeman it was heavily
loaded. The boy gave me a shilling, and that
was all the money I received. For a twelvemonth
I couldn’t hardly walk.</p>

<p>“On that Christmas-day I took four-and-tinpence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
but I owed it all for rint and things;
and I’m sure it’s a good man that let me run
it the score.</p>

<p>“Is it a shillin’ I iver git? Well, thin, sir,
there’s one gintleman, but he’s out of town&mdash;Sir
George Hewitt&mdash;niver passes without
givin’ me a shillin’.</p>

<p>“I have taken one-and-ninepence on a Sunday,
and I’ve taken two shillin’s. Upon my
sowl, I’ve often gone home with three ha’pence
and tuppence. For this month past, put ivery
day together, I haven’t taken three shilling
a-week.</p>

<p>“I wear two brooms out in a week in bad
wither, and thin p’rhaps I take four to five
shillin’, Sunday included; but for the three
year since here I’ve been on this crossin’, I
niver took tin shillin’, sir, niver.</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a man here before me: he
had bad eyes, and he was obligated to lave and
go into the worrukhouse; he lost the sight of
one of his eyes when he came back again. I
knew him sweepin’ here a long time. When
he come back, I said, ‘Father,’ says I, ‘I wint
on your crossin’.’ ‘Ah,’ says he, ‘you’ve got a
bad crossin’, poor woman; I wouldn’t go on
it again, I wouldn’t;’ and I niver seen him
since. I don’t know whether he is living or
not.</p>

<p>“A wit day makes fourpence or fippence
difference sometimes.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I have heard of crossin’-sweepers
makin’ so much and so much. I hear people
talkin’ about it, but, for my parrut, I wouldn’t
give heed to what they say. In Oxford-street,
towards the Parruks, there was a man, years
ago, they say, by all accounts left a dale of
money.</p>

<p>“I am niver annoyed by boys. I don’t
spake to none of them. I was in sarvice till I
got married, thin I used to sill fruit through
Kentish Town, Highgate, and Hampstead;
but I niver sould in the streets, sir, and had
my rigular customers like any greengrocer. I
had a good connixion, I had; but, by gitting
old and feeble, and sick, and not being able to
go about, I was forrussed to give it up, I was.
I couldn’t carry twelve pound upon my hid&mdash;no,
not if I was to get a sov’rin a-day for it,
now.</p>

<p>“I niver lave the crossin’. I haven’t got a
frind; nor a day’s pleasure I niver take.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, I must have a pinch&mdash;this is
my snuff-box. I take a ha’porth a-day, and
that’s the only comforrut I’ve got&mdash;that and a
cup of tay; for I can’t dthrink cocoa or coffee-tay.</p>

<p>“My feeding is a bit of brid and butther. I
haven’t bought a bit of mate these three
months. I used to git two penn’orth of bones
and mate at Mrs. Baker’s, down there; but
mate is so dear, that they don’t have ’em now,
and it’s ashamed I am of botherin’ thim so
often. I frequintly have a hirrin’. Oh dear!
no sir. Wather is my dthrink. I can’t afforrud
no beer. Sometimes I have a penn’orth of
gin and could water, and I find it do me a
worruld of good. Sometimes I git enough to
eat, but lately, indeed, I can’t git that. I declare
I don’t know which people give the most;
the gintlemen give me more in wit wither, for
then the ladies, you see, can’t let their dresses
out of their hands.</p>

<p>“I am a Catholic, sir. I go to St. Pathrick’s
sometimes, or I go to Gordon-street Churruch.
I don’t care which I go to&mdash;it’s all the same
to me; but I haven’t been to churruch for
months. I’ve nothing to charge mysilf wid;
and, indeed, I haven’t been to confission for
some year.</p>

<p>“Tradespeople are very kind, indeed they
are.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I’ll go to Kint a hop-pickin’;
and as for my crossin’, I lave it, sir, just as
it is. I go five miles beyant Maidstone. I
worruked fifteen years at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;; he was a
pole-puller and binsman in the hop-ground.</p>

<p>“I’ve not been down there since the year
before last. I was too poorly after that accident.
We make about eighteenpence, two
shillin’s, or one shillin’, ’cording as the hops
is good. No lodging nor fire to pay; and we
git plinty of good milk chape there. I manage
thin to save a little money to hilp us in the
winther.</p>

<p>“I live in &mdash;&mdash; street, Siven Dials; but I’m
going to lave my son&mdash;we can’t agree. We
live in the two-pair back. I pay nothing
a-week, only bring home ivery ha’penny to
hilp thim. Sometimes I spind a pinny or
tuppence out on mysilf.</p>

<p>“My son is doin’ very badly. He sills fruit
in the sthreets; but he’s niver been used to
it before; and he has pains in his limbs with
so much walking. He has no connixion, and
with the sthrawbirries now he’s forrused to
walk about of a night as will as a day, for they
won’t keep till the morrunning; they all go
mouldy and bad. My son has been used to
the bricklaying, sir: he can lit in a stove or a
copper, or do a bit of plasther or lath, or the
like. His wife is a very just, clane, sober
woman, and he has got three good childer;
there is Catherine, who is named afther me,
she is nearly five; Illen, two years and six
months, named after her mother; and Margaret,
the baby, six months ould&mdash;and she is
called afther my daughter, who is did.”</p>


<h4>4. <span class="smcap">The Occasional Crossing-Sweepers.</span></h4>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Sunday Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>“I’m a Sunday crossing-sweeper,” said an
oyster-stall keeper, in answer to my inquiries.
“I mean by that, I only sweep a crossing on a
Sunday. I pitch in the Lorrimore-road, Newington,
with a few oysters on week-days, and
I does jobs for the people about there, sich as
cleaning a few knives and forks, or shoes and
boots, and windows. I’ve been in the habit
of sweeping a crossing about four or five
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never knowed my father, he died when
I was a baby. He was a ’terpreter, and
spoke seven different languages. My father
used to go with Bonaparte’s army, and used
to ’terpret for him. He died in the South
of France. I had a brother, but he died
quite a child, and my mother supported me
and a sister by being cook in a gentleman’s
family: we was put out to nurse. My mother
couldn’t afford to put me to school, and so
I can’t read nor write. I’m forty-one years
old.</p>

<p>“The fust work I ever did was being
boy at a pork-butcher’s. I used to take out
the meat wot was ordered. At last my
master got broke up, and I was discharged
from my place, and I took to sellin’ a few
sprats. I had no thoughts of taking to a
crossing then. I was ten year old. I remember
I give two shillings for a ‘shallow;’
that’s a flat basket with two handles; they
put ’em a top of ‘well-baskets,’ them as can
carry a good load. A well-basket’s almost
like a coffin; it’s a long un like a shallow,
on’y it’s a good deal deeper&mdash;about as deep as
a washin’ tub. I done very fair with my
sprats till they got dear and come up very
small, so then I was obliged to get a few
plaice, and then I got a few baked ’taters
and sold them. I hadn’t money enough to
buy a tin&mdash;I could a got one for eight shillings&mdash;so
I put ’em in a cross-handle basket,
and carried ’em round the streets, and into
public-houses, and cried ‘Baked taters, all
hot!’ I used only to do this of a night, and
it brought me about four or five shillings a-week.
I used to fill up the day by going
round to gentlemen’s houses where I was
known, to run for errands and clean knives
and boots, and that brought me sich a thing
as four shillings a-week more altogether.</p>

<p>“I never had no idea then of sweeping a
crossing of a Sunday; but at last I was obliged
to push to it. I kept on like this for many
years, and at last a gentleman named Mr.
Jackson promised to buy me a tin, but he
died. My mother went blind through a
blight; that was the cause of my fust going
out to work, and so I had to keep her; but I
didn’t mind that: I thought it was my duty so
to do.</p>

<p>“About ten years ago I got married; my
wife used to go out washing and ironing. I
thought two of us would get on better than
one, and she didn’t mind helpin’ me to keep
my mother, for I was determined my mother
shouldn’t go into the workhouse so long as
I could help it.</p>

<p>“A year or two after I got married, I
found I must do something more to help to
keep home, and then I fust thought of
sweepin’ a crossing on Sundays; so I bought
a heath broom for twopence-ha’penny, and I
pitched agin’ the Canterbury Arms, Kennington;
it was between a baker’s shop and a
public-house and butcher’s; they told me
they’d all give me something if I’d sweep the
crossing reg’lar.</p>

<p>“The best places is in front of chapels
and churches, ’cause you can take more
money in front of a church or a chapel
than wot you can in a private road, ’cos
they look at it more, and a good many thinks
when you sweeps in front of a public-house
that you go and spend your money inside in
waste.</p>

<p>“The first Sunday I went at it, I took
eighteenpence. I began at nine o’clock in the
morning and stopped till four in the afternoon.
The publican give fourpence, and the
baker sixpence, and the butcher threepence,
so that altogether I got above a half-crown.
I stopped at this crossing a year, and I always
knocked up about two shillings or a half-crown
on the Sunday. I very seldom got
anythink from the ladies; it was most all
give by the gentlemen. Little children used
sometimes to give me ha’pence, but it was
when their father give it to ’em; the little
children like to do that sort of thing.</p>

<p>“The way I come to leave this crossing
was this here: the road was being repaired,
and they shot down a lot of stones, so then I
couldn’t sweep no crossing. I looked out for
another place, and I went opposite the Duke
of Sutherland public-house in the Lorrimore-road.
I swept there one Sunday, and I got
about one-and-sixpence. While I was sweeping
this crossing, a gentleman comes up to me,
and he axes me if I ever goes to chapel or
church; and I tells him, ‘Yes;’ I goes to
church, wot I’d been brought up to; and then
he says, ‘You let me see you at St. Michael’s
Church, Brixton, and I’ll ’courage you, and
you’ll do better if you come up and sweep
in front there of a Sunday instead of where
you are; you’ll be sure to get more money,
and get better ’couraged. It don’t matter
what you do,’ he says, ‘as long as it brings
you in a honest crust; anythink’s better than
thieving.’ And then the gent gives me sixpence
and goes away.</p>

<p>“As soon as he’d gone I started off to
his church, and got there just after the
people was all in. I left my broom in the
churchyard. When I got inside the church,
I could see him a-sitten jest agin the communion
table, so I walks to the free seats and
sets down right close again the communion
table myself, for his pew was on my right, and
he saw me directly and looked and smiled at
me. As he was coming out of the church
he says, says he, ‘As long as I live, if you
comes here on a Sunday reg’lar I shall always
’courage you.’</p>

<p>“The next Sunday I went up to the church
and swept the crossing, and he see me there,
but he didn’t give me nothink till the church
was over, and then he gave me a shilling, and
the other people give me about one-and-sixpence;
so I got about two-and-sixpence altogether,
and I thought that was a good beginning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>“The next Sunday the gen’elman was ill,
but he didn’t forget me. He sent me sixpence
by his servant, and I got from the other
people about two shillings more. I never see
that gentleman after, for he died on the Saturday.
His wife sent for me on the Sunday;
she was ill a-bed, and I see one of the daughters,
and she gave me sixpence, and said I
was to be there on Monday morning. I went
on the Monday, and the lady was much worse,
and I see the daughter again. She gave me
a couple of shirts, and told me to come on the
Friday, and when I went on that day I found
the old lady was dead. The daughter gave
me a coat, and trousers, and waistcoat.</p>

<p>“After the daughters had buried the father
and mother they moved. I kept on sweeping
at the church, till at last things got so bad
that I come away, for nobody give me nothink.
The houses about there was so damp that
people wouldn’t live in ’em.</p>

<p>“So then I come up into Lorrimore-road,
and there I’ve been ever since. I don’t get
on wonderful well there. Sometimes I don’t
get above sixpence all day, but it’s mostly a
shilling or so. The most I’ve took is about
one-and-sixpence. The reason why I stop
there is, because I’m known there, you see. I
stands there all the week selling highsters,
and the people about there give me a good
many jobs. Besides, the road is rather bad
there, and they like to have a clean crossing
of a Sunday.</p>

<p>“I don’t get any more money in the winter
(though it’s muddier) than I do in the summer;
the reason is, ’cause there isn’t so many
people stirring about in the winter as there is
in the summer.</p>

<p>“One broom will carry me over three Sundays,
and I gives twopence-ha’penny a-piece
for ’em. Sometimes the people bring me out
at my crossing&mdash;’specially in cold weather&mdash;a
mug of hot tea and some bread and butter, or
a bit of meat. I don’t know any other crossing-sweeper;
I never ’sociates with nobody. I
always keeps my own counsel, and likes my
own company the best.</p>

<p>“My wife’s been dead five months, and my
mother six months; but I’ve got a little boy
seven year old; he stops at school all day till
I go home at night, and then I fetches him
home. I mean to do something better with
him than give him a broom: a good many
people would set him on a crossing; but I
mean to keep him at school. I want to see
him read and write well, because he’ll suit
for a place then.</p>

<p>“There’s some art in sweeping a crossing
even. That is, you mustn’t sweep too hard,
’cos if you do, you wears a hole right in the
road, and then the water hangs in it. It’s the
same as sweeping a path; if you sweeps too
hard you wears up the stones.</p>

<p>“To do it properly, you must put the end
of the broom-handle in the palm of your right
hand, and lay hold of it with your left, about
halfway down; then you takes half your crossing,
and sweeps on one side till you gets over
the road; then you turns round and comes back
doing the other half. Some people holds the
broom before ’em, and keeps swaying it back’ards
and for’ards to sweep the width of the
crossing all in one stroke, but that ain’t sich
a good plan, ’cause you’re apt to splash people
that’s coming by; and besides, it wears the road
in holes and wears out the broom so quick. I
always use my broom steady. I never splash
nobody.</p>

<p>“I never tried myself, but I’ve seen some
crossin’-sweepers as could do all manner of
things in mud, sich as diamonds, and stars,
and the moon, and letters of the alphabet;
and once in Oxford-street I see our Saviour
on his cross in mud, and it was done well,
too. The figure wasn’t done with the broom,
it was done with a pointed piece of stick; it
was a boy as I see doin’ it, about fifteen. He
didn’t seem to take much money while I was
a-looking at him.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should a took to crossin’
sweeping if I hadn’t got married; but when
I’d got a couple of children (for I’ve had a
girl die; if she’d lived she’d a been eight
year old now,) I found I must do a somethin’,
and so I took to the broom.”</p>


<h4><i>B. The Afflicted Crossing-Sweepers.</i></h4>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Wooden-legged Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>This man lives up a little court running out of
a wide, second-rate street. It is a small court,
consisting of some half-dozen houses, all of
them what are called by courtesy “private.”</p>

<p>I inquired at No. 3 for John &mdash;&mdash;; “The
first-floor back, if you please, sir;” and to the
first-floor back I went.</p>

<p>Here I was answered by a good-looking and
intelligent young woman, with a baby, who
said her husband had not yet come home, but
would I walk in and wait? I did so; and
found myself in a very small, close room,
with a little furniture, which the man called
“his few sticks,” and presently discovered
another child&mdash;a little girl. The girl was very
shy in her manner, being only two years and
two months old, and as her mother said, very
ailing from the difficulty of cutting her teeth,
though the true cause seemed to be want of
proper nourishment and fresh air. The baby
was a boy&mdash;a fine, cheerful, good-tempered
little fellow, but rather pale, and with an unnaturally
large forehead. The mantelpiece
of the room was filled with little ornaments of
various sorts, such as bead-baskets, and over
them hung a series of black profiles&mdash;not
portraits of either the crossing-sweeper or
any of his family, but an odd lot of heads,
which had lost their owners many a year, and
served, in company with a little red, green,
and yellow scripture-piece, to keep the wall
from looking bare. Over the door (inside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
room) was nailed a horse-shoe, which, the
wife told me, had been put there by her husband,
for luck.</p>

<p>A bed, two deal tables, a couple of boxes, and
three chairs, formed the entire furniture of the
room, and nearly filled it. On the window-frame
was hung a small shaving-glass; and
on the two boxes stood a wicker-work apology
for a perambulator, in which I learnt the
poor crippled man took out his only daughter
at half-past four in the morning.</p>

<p>“If some people was to see that, sir,” said
the sweeper, when he entered and saw me
looking at it, “they would, and in fact they <i>do</i>
say, ‘Why, you can’t be in want.’ Ah! little
they know how we starved and pinched ourselves
before we could get it.”</p>

<p>There was a fire in the room, notwithstanding
the day was very hot; but the window was
wide open, and the place tolerably ventilated,
though oppressive. I have been in many
poor people’s “places,” but never remember
one so poor in its appointments and yet so
<i>free</i> from effluvia.</p>

<p>The crossing-sweeper himself was a very
civil sort of man, and in answer to my inquiries
<span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I know that I do as I ought to, and so I
don’t feel hurt at standing at my crossing. I
have been there four years. I found the place
vacant. My wife, though she looks very well,
will never be able to do any hard work; so we
sold our mangle, and I took to the crossing:
but we’re not in debt, and nobody can’t say
nothing to us. I like to go along the streets
free of such remarks as is made by people to
whom you owes money. I had a mangle in &mdash;&mdash; Yard,
but through my wife’s weakness I
was forced to part with it. I was on the crossing
a short time before that, for I knew that
if I parted with my mangle and things before
I knew whether I could get a living at the
crossing I couldn’t get my mangle back again.</p>

<p>“We sold the mangle only for a sovereign,
and we gave two-pound-ten for it; we sold it
to the same man that we bought it of. About
six months ago I managed for to screw and
save enough to buy that little wicker chaise,
for I can’t carry the children because of my
one leg, and of course the mother can’t carry
them both out together. There was a man
had the crossing I’ve got; he died three or
four years before I took it; but he didn’t depend
on the crossing&mdash;he did things for the
tradespeople about, such as carpet-beating,
messages, and so on.</p>

<p>“When I first took the crossing I did very
well. It happened to be a very nasty, dirty
season, and I took a good deal of money.
Sweepers are not always civil, sir.</p>

<p>“I wish I had gone to one of the squares,
though. But I think after &mdash;&mdash; street is paved
with stone I shall do better. I am certain I
never taste a bit of meat from one week’s end
to the other. The best day I ever made was
five-and-sixpence or six shillings; it was the
winter before last. If you remember, the snow
laid very thick on the ground, and the sudden
thaw made walking so uncomfortable, that I
did very well. I have taken as little as sixpence,
fourpence, and even twopence. Last
Thursday I took two ha’pence all day. Take
one week with the other, seven or eight shillings
is the very outside.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it is, but some people
who used to give me a penny, don’t now. The
boys who come in wet weather earn a great deal
more than I do. I once lost a good chance,
sir, at the corner of the street leading to Cavendish-square.
There’s a bank, and they pay a
man seven shillings a-week to sweep the
crossing: a butcher in Oxford Market spoke
for me; but when I went up, it unfortunately
turned out that I was not fit, from the loss of
my leg. The last man they had there they
were obliged to turn away&mdash;he was so given
to drink.</p>

<p>“I think there are some rich crossing-sweepers
in the city, about the Exchange;
but you won’t find them now during this dry
weather, except in by-places. In wet weather,
there are two or three boys who sweep near
my crossing, and take all my earnings away.
There’s a great able-bodied man besides&mdash;a
fellow strong enough to follow the plough. I
said to the policeman, ‘Now, ain’t this a shame?’
and the policeman said, ‘Well, <i>he</i> must get
his living as well as you.’ I’m always civil to
the police, and they’re always civil to me&mdash;in
fact, I think sometimes I’m too civil&mdash;I’m not
rough enough with people.</p>

<p>“You soon tell whether to have any hopes
of people coming across. I can tell a gentleman
directly I see him.</p>

<p>“Where I stand, sir, I could get people in
trouble everlasting; there’s all sorts of thieving
going on. I saw the other day two or three
respectable persons take a purse out of an old
lady’s pocket before the baker’s shop at the
corner; but I can’t say a word, or they would
come and throw me into the road. If a gentleman
gives me sixpence, he don’t give me
any more for three weeks or a month; but I
don’t think I’ve more than three or four gentlemen
as gives me that. Well, you can
scarcely tell the gentleman from the clerk, the
clerks are such great swells now.</p>

<p>“Lawyers themselves dress very plain; those
great men who don’t come every day, because
they’ve clerks to do their business for them,
they give most. People hardly ever stop to
speak unless it is to ask you where places are&mdash;you
might be occupied at that all day. I
manage to pay my rent out of what I take on
Sunday, but not lately&mdash;this weather religious
people go pleasuring.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t go now&mdash;the fact is, I’d like
to go to church, if I could, but when I come
home I am tired; but I’ve got books here, and
they do as well, sir. I read a little and write
a little.</p>

<p>“I lost my leg through a swelling&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
was no chloroform then. I was in the hospital
three years and a half, and was about fifteen
or sixteen when I had it off. I always feel the
sensation of the foot, and more so at change
of weather. I feel my toes moving about, and
everything; sometimes, it’s just as if the calf
of my leg was itching. I <i>feel</i> the rain coming;
when I see a cloud coming my leg shoots, and
I know we shall have rain.</p>

<p>“My mother was a laundress&mdash;my father
has been dead nineteen years my last birthday.
My mother was subject to fits, so I was
forced to stop at home to take care of the
business.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get on better, but I always
think, if sickness or anything comes <span class="lock">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am at my crossing at half-past eight; at
half-past eleven I come home to dinner. I go
back at one or two till seven.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I mind horses and carts, but
the boys get all that business. One of these
little customers got sixpence the other day
for only opening the door of a cab. I don’t
know how it is they let these little boys be
about; if I was the police, I wouldn’t allow it.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a blessing, having children&mdash;(referring
to his little girl)&mdash;that child wants
the gravy of meat, or an egg beaten up, but
she can’t get it. I take her out every morning
round Euston-square and those open
places. I get out about half-past four. It
is early, but if it benefits her, that’s no odds.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">One-legged Sweeper at Chancery-lane.</span></h5>

<p>“I don’t know what induced me to take
that crossing, except it was that no one was
there, and the traffic was so good&mdash;fact is, the
traffic is too good, and people won’t stop as
they cross over, they’re very glad to get out of
the way of the cabs and the omnibuses.</p>

<p>“Tradespeople never give me anything&mdash;not
even a bit of bread. The only thing I get
is a few cuttings, such as crusts of sandwiches
and remains of cheese, from the public-house
at the corner of the court. The tradespeople
are as distant to me now as they were when I
came, but if I should pitch up a tale I should
soon get acquainted with them.</p>

<p>“We have lived in this lodging two years
and a half, and we pay one-and-ninepence
a-week, as you may see from the rent-book,
and that I manage to earn on Sundays. We
owe four weeks now, and, thank God, it’s no
more.</p>

<p>“I was born, sir, in &mdash;&mdash; street, Berkeley-square,
at Lord <span class="lock">&mdash;&mdash;’s</span> house, when my
mother was minding the house. I have been
used to London all my life, but not to this
part; I have always been at the west-end, which
is what I call the best end.</p>

<p>“I did not like the idea of crossing-sweeping
at first, till I reasoned with myself, Why
should I mind? I’m not doing any hurt to anybody.
I don’t care at all now&mdash;I know I’m
doing what I ought to do.</p>

<p>“A man had better be killed out of the way
than be disabled. It’s not pleasant to know that
my wife is suckling that great child, and,
though she is so weakly, she can’t get no meat.</p>

<p>“I’ve been knocked down twice, sir&mdash;both
times by cabs. The last time it was a fortnight
before I could get about comfortably
again. The fool of a fellow was coming along,
not looking at his horse, but talking to somebody
on the cab-rank. The place was as free
as this room, if he had only been looking
before him. Nobody hollered till I was down,
but plenty hollered then. Ah, I often notice
such carelessness&mdash;it’s really shameful. I don’t
think those ‘shofuls’ (Hansoms) should be
allowed&mdash;the fact is, if the driver is not a tall
man he can’t see his horse’s head.</p>

<p>“A nasty place is end of &mdash;&mdash; street: it
narrows so suddenly. There’s more confusion
and more bother about it than any place in
London. When two cabs gets in at once, one
one way and one the other, there’s sure to be
a row to know which was the first in.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Most Severely-Afflicted of all the
Crossing-Sweepers.</span></h5>

<p>Passing the dreary portico of the Queen’s
Theatre, and turning to the right down Tottenham
Mews, we came upon a flight of steps
leading up to what is called “The Gallery,”
where an old man, gasping from the effects of
a lung disease, and feebly polishing some old
harness, proclaimed himself the father of the
sweeper I was in search of, and ushered me
into the room where he lay a-bed, having had
a “very bad night.”</p>

<p>The room itself was large and of a low pitch,
stretching over some stables; it was very old
and creaky (the sweeper called, it “an old wilderness”),
and contained, in addition to two
turn-up bedsteads, that curious medley of articles
which, in the course of years, an old
and poor couple always manage to gather up.
There was a large lithograph of a horse, dear
to the remembrance of the old man from an
indication of a dog in the corner. “The very
spit of the one I had for years; it’s a real
portrait, sir, for Mr. Hanbart, the printer, met
me one day and sketched him.” There was
an etching of Hogarth’s in a black frame; a
stuffed bird in a wooden case, with a glass
before it; a piece of painted glass, hanging in
a place of honour, but for which no name
could be remembered, excepting that it was
“of the old-fashioned sort.” There were the
odd remnants, too, of old china ornaments, but
very little furniture; and, finally, a kitten.</p>

<p>The father, worn out and consumptive, had
been groom to Lord Combermere. “I was
with him, sir, when he took Bonyparte’s house
at Malmasong. I could have had a pension
then if I’d a liked, but I was young and
foolish, and had plenty of money, and we
never know what we may come to.”</p>

<p>The sweeper, although a middle-aged man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
had all the appearance of a boy&mdash;his raw-looking
eyes, which he was always wiping with a
piece of linen rag, gave him a forbidding expression,
which his shapeless, short, bridgeless
nose tended to increase. But his manners and
habits were as simple in their character as
those of a child; and he spoke of his father’s
being angry with him for not getting up
before, as if he were a little boy talking of his
nurse.</p>

<p>He walks, with great difficulty, by the help
of a crutch; and the sight of his weak eyes,
his withered limb, and his broken shoulder
(his old helpless mother, and his gasping,
almost inaudible father,) form a most painful
subject for compassion.</p>

<p>The crossing-sweeper gave me, with no little
meekness and some slight intelligence, the
following <span class="lock">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I very seldom go out on a crossin’ o’ Sundays.
I didn’t do much good at it. I used to
go to church of a Sunday&mdash;in fact, I do now
when I’m well enough.</p>

<p>“It’s fifteen year next January since I left
Regent-street. I was there three years, and
then I went on Sundays occasionally. Sometimes
I used to get a shilling, but I have given
it up now&mdash;it didn’t answer; besides, a lady
who was kind to me found me out, and said
she wouldn’t do any more for me if I went out
on Sundays. She’s been dead these three or
four years now.</p>

<p>“When I was at Regent-street I might have
made twelve shillings a-week, or something
thereabout.</p>

<p>“I am seven-and-thirty the 26th day of last
month, and I have been lame six-and-twenty
years. My eyes have been bad ever since my
birth. The scrofulous disease it was that
lamed me&mdash;it come with a swelling on the
knee, and the outside wound broke about the
size of a crown piece, and a piece of bone come
from it; then it gathered in the inside and at
the top. I didn’t go into the hospital then,
but I was an out-patient, for the doctor said a
close confined place wouldn’t do me no good.
He said that the seaside would, though; but
my parents couldn’t afford to send me, and
that’s how it is. I <i>did</i> go to Brighton and
Margate nine years after my leg was bad, but
it was too late then.</p>

<p>“I have been in Middlesex Hospital, with a
broken collar-bone, when I was knocked down
by a cab. I was in a fortnight there, and I
was in again when I hurt my leg. I was
sweeping my crossin’ when the top came off
my crutch. I fell back’ards, and my leg
doubled under me. They had to carry me
there.</p>

<p>“I went into the Middlesex Hospital for my
eyes and leg. I was in a month, but they
wouldn’t keep me long, there’s no cure for me.</p>

<p>“My leg is very painful, ’specially at change
of weather. Sometimes I don’t get an hour’s
sleep of a night&mdash;it was daylight this morning
before I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>“I went on the crossing first because my
parents couldn’t keep me, not being able to
keep theirselves. I thought it was the best
thing I could do, but it’s like all other things,
it’s got very bad now. I used to manage to
rub along at first&mdash;the streets have got shockin’
bad of late.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I was turned away from
Regent-street by Mr. Cook, the furrier, corner
of Argyle Street. I’ll tell you as far as I was
told. He called me into his passage one
night, and said I must look out for another
crossin’, for a lady, who was a very good customer
of his, refused to come while I was
there; my heavy afflictions was such that she
didn’t like the look of me. I said, ‘Very well;’
but because I come there next day and the
day after that, he got the policeman to turn
me away. Certainly the policeman acted very
kindly, but he said the gentleman wanted me
removed, and I must find another crossing.</p>

<p>“Then I went down Charlotte-street, opposite
Percy Chapel, at the corner of Windmill-street.
After that I went to Wells-street, by
getting permission of the doctor at the corner.
He thought that it would be better for me
than Charlotte-street, so he let me come.</p>

<p>“Ah! there ain’t so many crossing-sweepers
as there was; I think they’ve done away with
a great many of them.</p>

<p>“When I first went to Wells-street, I did
pretty well, because there was a dress-maker’s
at the corner, and I used to get a good deal
from the carriages that stopped before the door.
I used to take five or six shillings in a day
then, and I don’t take so much in a week now.
I tell you what I made this week. I’ve made
one-and-fourpence, but it’s been so wet, and
people are out of town; but, of course, it’s not
always alike&mdash;sometimes I get three-and-sixpence
or four shillings. Some people gives
me a sixpence or a fourpenny-bit; I reckons
that all in.</p>

<p>“I am dreadful tired when I comes home of
a night. Thank God my other leg’s all right!
I wish the t’other was as strong, but it never
will be now.</p>

<p>“The police never try to turn me away;
they’re very friendly, they’ll pass the time of
day with me, or that, from knowing me so long
in Oxford-street.</p>

<p>“My broom sometimes serves me a month;
of course, they don’t last long now it’s showery
weather. I give twopence-halfpenny a piece
for ’em, or threepence.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who gives me the most; my
eyes are so bad I can’t see. I think, though,
upon an average, the gentlemen give most.</p>

<p>“Often I hear the children, as they are going
by, ask their mothers for something to give to
me; but they only say, ‘Come along&mdash;come
along!’ It’s very rare that they lets the
children have a ha’penny to give me.</p>

<p>“My mother is seventy the week before next
Christmas. She can’t do much now; she does
though go out on Wednesdays or Saturdays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
but that’s to people she’s known for years who
is attached to her. She does her work there
just as she likes.</p>

<p>“Sometimes she gets a little washing&mdash;sometimes
not. This week she had a little,
and was forced to dry it indoors; but that
makes ’em half dirty again.</p>

<p>“My father’s breath is so bad that he can’t
do anything except little odd jobs for people
down here; but they’ve got the knack now, a
good many on ’em, of doin’ their own.</p>

<p>“We have lived here fifteen years next September;
it’s a long time to live in such an old
wilderness, but my old mother is a sort of
woman as don’t like movin’ about, and I don’t
like it. Some people are everlasting on the
move.</p>

<p>“When I’m not on my crossin’ I sit poking
at home, or make a job of mending my clothes.
I mended these trousers in two or three places.</p>

<p>“It’s all done by feel, sir. My mother says
it’s a good thing we’ve got our feeling at least,
if we haven’t got our eyesight.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Negro Crossing-Sweeper, who had
lost both his Legs.</span></h5>

<p>This man sweeps a crossing in a principal and
central thoroughfare when the weather is cold
enough to let him walk; the colder the better,
he says, as it “numbs his stumps like.” He
is unable to follow this occupation in warm
weather, as his legs feel “just like corns,”
and he cannot walk more than a mile a-day.
Under these circumstances he takes to begging,
which he thinks he has a perfect right
to do, as he has been left destitute in what
is to him almost a strange country, and has
been denied what he terms “his rights.” He
generally sits while begging, dressed in a
sailor shirt and trousers, with a black neckerchief
round his neck, tied in the usual nautical
knot. He places before him the placard
which is given beneath, and never moves a
muscle for the purpose of soliciting charity. He
always appears scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>I went to see him at his home early one
morning&mdash;in fact, at half-past eight, but he
was not then up. I went again at nine, and
found him prepared for my visit in a little parlour,
in a dirty and rather disreputable alley
running out of a court in a street near Brunswick-square.
The negro’s parlour was scantily
furnished with two chairs, a turn-up bedstead,
and a sea-chest. A few odds and ends of
crockery stood on the sideboard, and a kettle
was singing over a cheerful bit of fire. The
little man was seated on a chair, with his
stumps of legs sticking straight out. He
showed some amount of intelligence in answering
my questions. We were quite alone,
for he sent his wife and child&mdash;the former a
pleasant-looking “half-caste,” and the latter
the cheeriest little crowing, smiling “piccaninny”
I have ever seen&mdash;he sent them out
into the alley, while I conversed with himself.</p>

<p>His life is embittered by the idea that he
has never yet had “his rights”&mdash;that the
owners of the ship in which his legs were
burnt off have not paid him his wages (of
which, indeed, he says, he never received any
but the five pounds which he had in advance
before starting), and that he has been robbed of
42<i>l.</i> by a grocer in Glasgow. How true these
statements may be it is almost impossible to
say, but from what he says, some injustice
seems to have been done him by the canny
Scotchman, who refuses him his “pay,” without
which he is determined “never to leave
the country.”</p>

<p>“I was on that crossing,” he said, “almost
the whole of last winter. It was very cold,
and I had nothing at all to do; so, as I passed
there, I asked the gentleman at the baccer-shop,
as well as the gentleman at the office,
and I asked at the boot-shop, too, if they would
let me sweep there. The policeman wanted
to turn me away, but I went to the gentleman
inside the office, and he told the policeman to
leave me alone. The policeman said first,
‘You must go away,’ but I said, ‘I couldn’t
do anything else, and he ought to think it a
charity to let me stop.’</p>

<p>“I don’t stop in London very long, though,
at a time; I go to Glasgow, in Scotland, where
the owners of the ship in which my legs were
burnt off live. I served nine years in the merchant
service and the navy. I was born in
Kingston, in Jamaica; it is an English place,
sir, so I am counted as not a foreigner. I’m
different from them Lascars. I went to sea
when I was only nine years old. The owners
is in London who had that ship. I was cabin-boy;
and after I had served my time I became
cook, or when I couldn’t get the place of
cook I went before the mast. I went as head
cook in 1851, in the <i>Madeira</i> barque; she used
to be a West Indy trader, and to trade out
when I belonged to her. We got down to 69
south of Cape Horn; and there we got almost
froze and perished to death. That is the book
what I sell.”</p>

<p>The “Book” (as he calls it) consists of
eight pages, printed on paper the size of a
sheet of note paper; it is <span class="lock">entitled&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="large">EDWARD ALBERT!</span></p>

<p>It is embellished with a portrait of a black
man, which has evidently been in its time a
comic “nigger” of the Jim-Crow tobacco-paper
kind, as is evidenced by the traces of a tobacco-pipe,
which has been unskilfully erased.</p>

<p>The “Book” itself is concocted from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
affidavit made by Edward Albert before “P.
Mackinlay, Esq., one of Her Majesty’s Justices
of the Peace for the country (so it is printed)
of Lanark.”</p>

<p>I have seen the affidavit, and it is almost
identical with the statement in the “book,”
excepting in the matter of grammar, which
has rather suffered on its road to Mr. Howe,
the printer.</p>

<p>The following will give an idea of the
matter of which it is <span class="lock">composed:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In February, 1851, I engaged to serve as cook on
board the barque <i>Madeira</i>, of Glasgow, Captain J.
Douglas, on her voyage from Glasgow to California,
thence to China, and thence home to a port of discharge
in the United Kingdom. I signed articles, and
delivered up my register-ticket as a British seaman,
as required by law. I entered the service on board
the said vessel, under the said engagement, and
sailed with that vessel on the 18th of February, 1851.
I discharged my duty as cook on board the said
vessel, from the date of its having left the Clyde,
until June the same year, in which month the
vessel rounded Cape Horne, at that time my legs
became frost bitten, and I became in consequence
unfit for duty.</p>

<p>“In the course of the next day after my limbs
became affected, the master of the vessel, and mate,
took me to the ship’s oven, in order, as they said, to
cure me; the oven was hot at the time, a fowl that
was roasting therein having been removed in order
to make room for my feet, which was put into the
oven; in consequence of the treatment, my feet
burst through the intense swelling, and mortification
ensued.</p>

<p>“The vessel called, six weeks after, at Valpariso,
and I was there taken to an hospital, where I remained
five months and a half. Both my legs were
amputated three inches below my knees soon after
I went to the hospital at Valpariso. I asked my
master for my wages due to me, for my service on
board the vessel, and demanded my register-ticket;
when the captain told me I should not recover, that
the vessel could not wait for me, and that I was a
dead man, and that he could not discharge a dead
man; and that he also said, that as I had no friends
there to get my money, he would only put a little
money into the hands of the consul, which would be
applied in burying me. On being discharged from
the hospital I called on the consul, and was informed
by him that master had not left any money.</p>

<p>“I was afterwards taken on board one of her
Majesty’s ships, the <i>Driver</i>, Captain Charles Johnston,
and landed at Portsmouth; from thence I got a passage
to Glasgow, ware I remained three months.
Upon supplication to the register-office for seamen, in
London, my register-ticket has been forwarded to the
Collector of Customs, Glasgow; and he is ready to
deliver it to me upon obtaining the authority of the
Justices of the Peace, and I recovered the same under
the 22nd section of the General Merchant Seaman’s
Act. Declares I cannot write.</p>

<p class="sig">
“(Signed)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <span class="smcap">David Mackinlay, J. P.</span>
</p>

<p>“The Justices having considered the foregoing information
and declaration, finds that Edward Albert,
therein named the last-register ticket, sought to be
covered under circumstances which, so far as he was
concerned, were unavoidable, and that no fraud was
intended or committed by him in reference thereto,
therefore authorised the Collector and Comptroller of
Customs at the port of Glasgow to deliver to the said
Edward Albert the register-ticket, sought to be recovered
by him all in terms of 22nd section of the
General Merchant Seamen’s Act.</p>

<p class="sig">
“(Signed)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <span class="smcap">David Mackinlay, J. P.</span>
</p>

<p>“Glasgow, Oct. 6th, 1852.</p>

<p>“Register Ticket, No. 512, 652, age 25 years.”</p></div>

<p>“I could make a large book of my sufferings,
sir, if I liked,” he said, “and I will disgrace
the owners of that ship as long as they
don’t give me what they owe me.</p>

<p>“I will never leave England or Scotland
until I get my rights; but they says money
makes money, and if I had money I could get
it. If they would only give me what they owe
me, I wouldn’t ask anybody for a farthing,
God knows, sir. I don’t know why the master
put my feet in the oven; he said to cure me:
the agony of pain I was in was such, he said,
that it must be done.</p>

<p>“The loss of my limbs is bad enough, but
it’s still worse when you can’t get what is your
rights, nor anything for the sweat that they
worked out of me.</p>

<p>“After I went down to Glasgow for my
money I opened a little coffee-house; it was
called ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’ I did very well.
The man who sold me tea and coffee said he
would get me on, and I had better give my
money to him to keep safe, and he used to put
it away in a tin box which I had given four-and-sixpence
for. He advertised my place in
the papers, and I did a good business. I had
the place open a month, when he kept all my
savings&mdash;two-and-forty pounds&mdash;and shut up
the place, and denied me of it, and I never got
a farthing.</p>

<p>“I declare to you I can’t describe the agony
I felt when my legs were burst; I fainted away
over and over again. There was four men
came; I was lying in my hammock, and they
moved the fowl that was roasting, and put my
legs in the oven. There they held me for ten
minutes. They said, it would take the cold
out; but after I came out the cold caught ’em
again, and the next day they swole up as big
round as a pillar, and burst, and then like
water come out. No man but God knows what
I have suffered and went through.</p>

<p>“By the order of the doctor at Valparaiso,
the sick patients had to come out of the room
I went into; the smell was so bad I couldn’t
bear it myself&mdash;it was all mortification&mdash;they
had to use chloride o’ zinc to keep the smell
down. They tried to save one leg, but the
mortification was getting up into my body. I
got better after my legs were off.</p>

<p>“I was three months good before I could
turn, or able to lift up my hand to my head. I
was glad to move after that time, it was a
regular relief to me; if it wasn’t for good
attendance, I should not have lived. You
know they don’t allow tobaccer in a hospital,
but I had it; it was the only thing I cared for.
The Reverend Mr. Armstrong used to bring
me a pound a fortnight; he used to bring it
regular. I never used to smoke before; they
said I never should recover, but after I got the
tobaccer it seemed to soothe me. I was five
months and a half in that place.</p>

<p>“Admiral Moseley, of the <i>Thetis</i> frigate,
sent me home; and the reason why he sent
me home was, that after I came well, I called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
on Mr. Rouse, the English consul, and he
sent me to the boarding-house, till such time
as he could find a ship to send me home in.
I was there about two months, and the boarding-master,
Jan Pace, sent me to the consul.</p>

<p>“I used to get about a little, with two small
crutches, and I also had a little cart before
that, on three wheels; it was made by a man
in the hospital. I used to lash myself down in
it. That was the best thing I ever had&mdash;I
could get about best in that.</p>

<p>“Well, I went to the consul, and when I
went to him, he says, ‘I can’t pay your board;
you must beg and pay for it;’ so I went and
told Jan Pace, and he said, ‘If you had stopped
here a hundred years, I would not turn you
out;’ and then I asked Pace to tell me where
the Admiral lived. ‘What do you want with
him?’ says he. I said, ‘I think the Admiral
must be higher than the consul.’ Pace slapped
me on the back. Says he, ‘I’m glad to see
you’ve got the pluck to complain to the
Admiral.’</p>

<p>“I went down at nine o’clock the next morning,
to see the Admiral. He said, ‘Well,
Prince Albert, how are you getting on?’ So I
told him I was getting on very bad; and then
I told him all about the consul; and he said,
as long as he stopped he would see me righted,
and took me on board his ship, the <i>Thetis</i>;
and he wrote to the consul, and said to me,
‘If the consul sends for you, don’t you go to
him; tell him you have no legs to walk, and
he must walk to you.’</p>

<p>“The consul wanted to send me back in
a merchant ship, but the Admiral wouldn’t
have it, so I came in the <i>Driver</i>, one of Her
Majesty’s vessels. It was the 8th of May,
1852, when I got to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>“I stopped a little while&mdash;about a week&mdash;in
Portsmouth. I went to the Admiral of the
dockyard, and he told me I must go to the
Lord Mayor of London. So I paid my passage
to London, saw the Lord Mayor, who sent me
to Mr. Yardley, the magistrate, and he advertised
the case for me, and I got four pounds
fifteen shillings, besides my passage to Glasgow.
After I got there, I went to Mr. Symee
a Custom-house officer (he’d been in the same
ship with me to California); he said, ‘Oh, gracious,
Edward, how have you lost your limbs!’
and I burst out a crying. I told him all about
it. He advised me to go to the owner. I
went there; but the policeman in London had
put my name down as Robert Thorpe, which
was the man I lodged with; so they denied
me.</p>

<p>“I went to the shipping office, where they
reckonised me; and I went to Mr. Symee
again, and he told me to go before the Lord
Mayor (a Lord Provost they call him in Scotland),
and make an affidavit; and so, when
they found my story was right, they sent to
London for my seaman’s ticket; but they
couldn’t do anything, because the captain was
not there.</p>

<p>“When I got back to London, I commenced
sweeping the crossin’, sir. I only sweep it in
the winter, because I can’t stand in the summer.
Oh, yes, I feel my feet still: it is just as if I
had them sitting on the floor, now. I feel my
toes moving, like as if I had ’em. I could
count them, the whole ten, whenever I work
my knees. I had a corn on one of my toes,
and I can feel it still, particularly at the change
of weather.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I might get two shillings a-day
at my crossing, sometimes one shilling and
sixpence, sometimes I don’t take above sixpence.
The most I ever made in one day was
three shillings and sixpence, but that’s very
seldom.</p>

<p>“I am a very steady man. I don’t drink
what money I get; and if I had the means
to get something to do, I’d keep off the
streets.</p>

<p>“When I offered to go to the parish, they
told me to go to Scotland, to spite the men
who owed me my wages.</p>

<p>“Many people tell me I ought to go to my
country; but I tell them it’s very hard&mdash;I
didn’t come here without my legs&mdash;I lost them,
as it were, in this country; but if I had lost
them in my own country, I should have been
better off. I should have gone down to the
magistrate every Friday, and have taken my
ten shillings.</p>

<p>“I went to the Merchant Seaman’s Fund,
and they said that those who got hurted before
1852 have been getting the funds, but those
who were hurted after 1852 couldn’t get nothing&mdash;it
was stopped in ’51, and the merchants
wouldn’t pay any more, and don’t pay any
more.</p>

<p>“That’s scandalous, because, whether you’re
willing or not, you must pay two shillings a-month
(one shilling a-month for the hospital
fees, and one shilling a-month to the Merchant
Seaman’s Fund), out of your pay.</p>

<p>“I am married: my wife is the same colour
as me, but an Englishwoman. I’ve been
married two years. I married her from where
she belonged, in Leeds. I couldn’t get on to
do anything without her. Sometimes she
goes out and sells things&mdash;fruit, and so on&mdash;but
she don’t make much. With the assistance
of my wife, if I could get my money, I
would set up in the same line of business
as before, in a coffee-shop. If I had three
pounds I could do it: it took well in Scotland.
I am not a common cook, either; I am a
pastrycook. I used to make all the sorts
of cakes they have in the shops. I bought
the shapes, and tins, and things to make them
proper.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how I did&mdash;there was a kind
of apparatus; it boils water and coffee, and
the milk and the tea, in different departments;
but you couldn’t see the divisions&mdash;the pipes
all ran into one tap, like. I’ve had a sixpence
and a shilling for people to look at it: it cost
me two pound ten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>“Even if I had a coffee-stall down at Covent-garden,
I should do; and, besides, I understand
the making of eel-soup. I have one
child,&mdash;it is just three months and a week old.
It is a boy, and we call it James Edward
Albert. James is after my grandfather, who
was a slave.</p>

<p>“I was a little boy when the slaves in
Jamaica got their freedom: the people were
very glad to be free; they do better since, I
know, because some of them have got property,
and send their children to school.
There’s more Christianity there than there is
here. The public-house is close shut on
Saturday night, and not opened till Monday
morning. No fruit is allowed to be sold in the
street. I am a Protestant. I don’t know the
name of the church, but I goes down to a new-built
church, near King’s-cross. I never go
in, because of my legs; but I just go inside
the door; and sometimes when I don’t go, I
read the Testament I’ve got here: in all my
sickness I took care of that.</p>

<p>“There are a great many Irish in this place.
I would like to get away from it, for it is a very
disgraceful place,&mdash;it is an awful, awful place
altogether. I haven’t been in it very long, and
I want to get out of it; it is not fit.</p>

<p>“I pay one-and-sixpence rent. If you don’t
go out and drink and carouse with them, they
don’t like it; they make use of bad language&mdash;they
chaff me about my misfortune&mdash;they call
me ‘Cripple;’ some says ‘Uncle Tom,’ and
some says ‘Nigger;’ but I never takes no
notice of ’em at all.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Maimed Irish Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>He stands at the corner of &mdash;&mdash; street, where
the yellow omnibuses stop, and refers to himself
every now and then as the “poor lame
man.” He has no especial mode of addressing
the passers-by, except that of hobbling a step
or two towards them and sweeping away an
imaginary accumulation of mud. He has lost
one leg (from the knee) by a fall from a scaffold,
while working as a bricklayer’s labourer
in Wales, some six years ago; and speaks bitterly
of the hard time he had of it when he
first came to London, and hobbled about selling
matches. He says he is thirty-six, but
looks more than fifty; and his face has the
ghastly expression of death. He wears the
ordinary close cloth street-cap and corduroy
trousers. Even during the warm weather he
wears an upper coat&mdash;a rough thick garment,
fit for the Arctic regions. It was very difficult
to make him understand my object in getting
information from him: he thought that he
had nothing to tell, and laid great stress upon
the fact of his never keeping “count” of anything.</p>

<p>He accounted for his miserably small income
by stating that he was an invalid&mdash;“now
and thin continually.” He <span class="lock">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I can’t say how long I have been on this
crossin’; I think about five year. When I
came on it there had been no one here before.
No one interferes with me at all, at all. I
niver hard of a crossin’ bein’ sould; but I don’t
know any other sweepers. I makes no fraydom
with no one, and I always keeps my own mind.</p>

<p>“I dunno how much I earn a-day&mdash;p’rhaps
I may git a shilling, and p’rhaps sixpence. I
didn’t git much yesterday (Sunday)&mdash;only
sixpence. I was not out on Saturday; I was
ill in bed, and I was at home on Friday. Indeed,
I did not get much on Thursday, only
tuppence ha’penny. The largest day? I
dunno. Why, about a shilling. Well, sure,
I might git as much as two shillings, if I got
a shillin’ from a lady. Some gintlemen are
good&mdash;such a gintleman as you, now, might
give me a shilling.</p>

<p>“Well, as to weather, I likes half dry and
half wit; of course I wish for the bad wither.
Every one must be glad of what brings good
to him; and, there’s one thing, I can’t make
the wither&mdash;I can’t make a fine day nor a wit
one. I don’t think anybody would interfere
with me; certainly, if I was a blaggya’rd I
should not be left here; no, nor if I was a
thief; but if any other man was to come on to
my crossing, I can’t say whether the police
<i>would</i> interfere to protect me&mdash;p’rhaps they
might.</p>

<p>“What is it I say to shabby people? Well,
by <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span>, they’re all shabby, I think. I don’t
see any difference; but what can I do? I can’t
insult thim, and I was niver insulted mysilf,
since here I’ve been, nor, for the matter of that,
ever had an angry worrud spoken to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, sure, I dunno who’s the most liberal;
if I got a fourpinny bit from a moll I’d take
it. Some of the ladies are very liberal; a good
lady will give a sixpence. I never hard of
sweepin’ the mud back again; and as for the
boys annoying me, I has no coleaguein’ with
boys, and they wouldn’t be allowed to interfere
with me&mdash;the police wouldn’t allow it.</p>

<p>“After I came from Wales, where I was on
one leg, selling matches, then it was I took to
sweep the crossin’. A poor divil must put up
with anything, good or bad. Well, I was a
laborin’ man, a bricklayer’s labourer, and I’ve
been away from Ireland these sixteen year.
When I came from Ireland I went to Wales.
I was there a long time; and the way I broke
my leg was, I fell off a scaffold. I am not
married; a lame man wouldn’t get any woman
to have him in London at all, at all. I don’t
know what age I am. I am not fifty, nor
forty; I think about thirty-six. No, by <span class="lock">J&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
it’s not mysilf that iver knew a well-off crossin’-sweeper.
I don’t dale in them at all.</p>

<p>“I got a dale of friends in London assist
me (but only now and thin). If I depinded
on the few ha’pence I get, I wouldn’t live on
’em; what money I get here wouldn’t buy a
pound of mate; and I wouldn’t live, only for
my frinds. You see, sir, I can’t be out always.
I am laid up nows and thins continually. Oh,
it’s a poor trade to big on the crossin’ from
morning till night, and not get sixpence. I
couldn’t do with it, I know.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I smoke; it’s a comfort, it is. I
like any kind I’d get to smoke. I’d like the
best if I got it.</p>

<p>“I am a Roman Catholic, and I go to St.
Patrick’s, in St. Giles’s; a many people from my
neighbourhood go there. I go every Sunday,
and to Confession just once a-year&mdash;that saves
me.</p>

<p>“By the Lord’s mercy! I don’t get broken
victuals, nor broken mate, not as much as you
might put on the tip of a forruk; they’d chuck
it out in the dust-bin before they’d give it to
me. I suppose they’re all alike.</p>

<p>“The divil an odd job I iver got, master,
nor knives to clane. If I got their knives to
clane, p’rhaps I might clane them.</p>

<p>“My brooms cost threepence ha’penny; they
are very good. I wear them down to a stump,
and they last three weeks, this fine wither. I
niver got any ould clothes&mdash;not but I want a
coat very bad, sir.</p>

<p>“I come from Dublin; my father and mother
died there of cholera; and when they
died, I come to England, and that was the
cause of my coming.</p>

<p>“By my oath it didn’t stand me in more than
eighteenpence that I took here last week.</p>

<p>“I live in &mdash;&mdash; lane, St. Giles’s Church, on
the second landing, and I pay eightpence a
week. I haven’t a room to mysilf, for there’s
a family lives in it wid me.</p>

<p>“When I goes home I just smokes a pipe,
and goes to bid, that’s all.”</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;JUVENILE CROSSING-SWEEPERS.</h3>


<h4><i>A. The Boy Crossing-Sweepers.</i></h4>


<h5><span class="smcap">Boy Crossing-Sweepers and Tumblers.</span></h5>

<p>A remarkably intelligent lad, who, on being
spoken to, at once consented to give all the
information in his power, told me the following
story of his life.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this boy’s account,
and the one or two following, that a kind
of partnership exists among some of these
young sweepers. They have associated themselves
together, appropriated several crossings
to their use, and appointed a captain
over them. They have their forms of trial,
and “jury-house” for the settlement of disputes;
laws have been framed, which govern
their commercial proceedings, and a kind of
language adopted by the society for its better
protection from its arch-enemy, the policeman.</p>

<p>I found the lad who first gave me an insight
into the proceedings of the associated crossing-sweepers
crouched on the stone steps of a
door in Adelaide-street, Strand; and when I
spoke to him he was preparing to settle
down in a corner and go to sleep&mdash;his legs
and body being curled round almost as closely
as those of a cat on a hearth.</p>

<p>The moment he heard my voice he was upon
his feet, asking me to “give a halfpenny to
poor little Jack.”</p>

<p>He was a good-looking lad, with a pair of
large mild eyes, which he took good care to
turn up with an expression of supplication
as he moaned for his halfpenny.</p>

<p>A cap, or more properly a stuff bag, covered
a crop of hair which had matted itself into the
form of so many paint-brushes, while his face,
from its roundness of feature and the complexion
of dirt, had an almost Indian look
about it; the colour of his hands, too, was
such that you could imagine he had been
shelling walnuts.</p>

<p>[<i>From a Daguerreotype by</i> <span class="smcap">Beard</span>.]</p></div>
</div>

<p>He ran before me, treading cautiously with
his naked feet, until I reached a convenient
spot to take down his statement, which was as
<span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got no mother or father; mother has
been dead for two years, and father’s been
gone more than that&mdash;more nigh five years&mdash;he
died at Ipswich, in Suffolk. He was a
perfumer by trade, and used to make hair-dye,
and scent, and pomatum, and all kinds of
scents. He didn’t keep a shop himself, but
he used to serve them as did; he didn’t hawk
his goods about, neether, but had regular customers,
what used to send him a letter, and
then he’d take them what they wanted. Yes,
he used to serve some good shops: there was
<span class="lock">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>’s, of London Bridge, what’s a large
chemist’s. He used to make a good deal of
money, but he lost it betting; and so his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
brother, my uncle, did all his. He used to go
up to High Park, and then go round by the
Hospital, and then turn up a yard, where all
the men are who play for money [Tattersall’s];
and there he’d lose his money, or sometimes
win,&mdash;but that wasn’t often. I remember he
used to come home tipsy, and say he’d lost on
this or that horse, naming wot one he’d laid
on; and then mother would coax him to bed,
and afterwards sit down and begin to cry.</p>

<p>“I was not with father when he died (but I
was when he was dying), for I was sent up
along with eldest sister to London with a
letter to uncle, who was head servant at a
doctor’s. In this letter, mother asked uncle
to pay back some money wot he owed, and
wot father lent him, and she asked him if he’d
like to come down and see father before he
died. I recollect I went back again to mother
by the Orwell steamer. I was well dressed
then, and had good clothes on, and I was
given to the care of the captain&mdash;Mr. King
his name was. But when I got back to Ipswich,
father was dead.</p>

<p>“Mother took on dreadful; she was ill for
three months afterwards, confined to her bed.
She hardly eat anything: only beaf-tea&mdash;I
think they call it&mdash;and eggs. All the while
she kept on crying.</p>

<p>“Mother kept a servant; yes, sir, we always
had a servant, as long as I can recollect; and
she and the woman as was there&mdash;Anna they
called her, an old lady&mdash;used to take care of
me and sister. Sister was fourteen years old
(she’s married to a young man now, and they’ve
gone to America; she went from a place in
the East India Docks, and I saw her off). I
used, when I was with mother, to go to school
in the morning, and go at nine and come home
at twelve to dinner, then go again at two and
leave off at half-past four,&mdash;that is, if I behaved
myself and did all my lessons right; for
if I did not I was kept back till I <i>did</i> them so.
Mother used to pay one shilling a-week, and
extra for the copy-books and things. I can
read and write&mdash;oh, yes, I mean read and
write well&mdash;read anything, even old English;
and I write pretty fair,&mdash;though I don’t get
much reading now, unless it’s a penny paper&mdash;I’ve
got one in my pocket now&mdash;it’s the
<i>London Journal</i>&mdash;there’s a tale in it now about
two brothers, and one of them steals the child
away and puts another in his place, and then
he gets found out, and all that, and he’s just
been falling off a bridge now.</p>

<p>“After mother got better, she sold all the
furniture and goods and came up to London;&mdash;poor
mother! She let a man of the name
of Hayes have the greater part, and he left
Ipswich soon after, and never gave mother the
money. We came up to London, and mother
took two rooms in Westminster, and I and
sister lived along with her. She used to
make hair-nets, and sister helped her, and
used to take ’em to the hair-dressers to sell.
She made these nets for two or three years,
though she was suffering with a bad breast;&mdash;she
died of that&mdash;poor thing!&mdash;for she
had what doctors calls cancer&mdash;perhaps you’ve
heard of ’em, sir,&mdash;and they had to cut all
round here (making motions with his hands
from the shoulder to the bosom). Sister saw
it, though I didn’t.</p>

<p>“Ah! she was a very good, kind mother,
and very fond of both of us; though father
wasn’t, for he’d always have a noise with
mother when he come home, only he was
seldom with us when he was making his
goods.</p>

<p>“After mother died, sister still kept on
making nets, and I lived with her for some
time, until she told me she couldn’t afford to
keep me no longer, though she seemed to
have a pretty good lot to do; but she would
never let me go with her to the shops, though
I could crochet, which she’d learned me, and
used to run and get her all her silks and things
what she wanted. But she was keeping company
with a young man, and one day they
went out, and came back and said they’d been
and got married. It was him as got rid of me.</p>

<p>“He was kind to me for the first two or
three months, while he was keeping her company;
but before he was married he got a
little cross, and after he was married he begun
to get more cross, and used to send me to play
in the streets, and tell me not to come home
again till night. One day he hit me, and I
said I wouldn’t be hit about by him, and then
at tea that night sister gave me three shillings,
and told me I must go and get my own living.
So I bought a box and brushes (they cost me
just the money) and went cleaning boots, and
I done pretty well with them, till my box was
stole from me by a boy where I was lodging.
He’s in prison now&mdash;got six calendar for
picking pockets.</p>

<p>“Sister kept all my clothes. When I asked
her for ’em, she said they was disposed of along
with all mother’s goods; but she gave me some
shirts and stockings, and such-like, and I had
very good clothes, only they was all worn out.
I saw sister after I left her, many times. I
asked her many times to take me back, but
she used to say, ‘It was not her likes, but her
husband’s, or she’d have had me back;’ and I
think it was true, for until he came she was a
kind-hearted girl; but he said he’d enough
to do to look after his own living; he was a
fancy-baker by trade.</p>

<p>“I was fifteen the 24th of last May, sir, and
I’ve been sweeping crossings now near upon
two years. There’s a party of six of us, and
we have the crossings from St. Martin’s Church
as far as Pall Mall. I always go along with
them as lodges in the same place as I do. In
the daytime, if it’s dry, we do anythink what
we can&mdash;open cabs, or anythink; but if it’s
wet, we separate, and I and another gets a
crossing&mdash;those who gets on it first, keeps it,&mdash;and
we stand on each side and take our
chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>“We do it in this way:&mdash;if I was to see two
gentlemen coming, I should cry out, ‘Two
toffs!’ and then they are mine; and whether
they give me anythink or not they are mine,
and my mate is bound not to follow them; for
if he did he would get a hiding from the whole
lot of us. If we both cry out together, then
we share. If it’s a lady and gentleman, then
we cries, ‘A toff and a doll!’ Sometimes we
are caught out in this way. Perhaps it is a
lady and gentleman and a child; and if I was
to see them, and only say, ‘A toff and a doll,’
and leave out the child, then my mate can add
the child; and as he is right and I wrong,
then it’s his party.</p>

<p>“If there’s a policeman close at hand we
mustn’t ask for money; but we are always on
the look-out for the policemen, and if we see
one, then we calls out ‘Phillup!’ for that’s
our signal. One of the policemen at St. Martin’s
Church&mdash;Bandy, we calls him&mdash;knows
what Phillup means, for he’s up to us; so we
had to change the word. (At the request of
the young crossing-sweeper the present signal
is omitted.)</p>

<p>“Yesterday on the crossing I got threepence
halfpenny, but when it’s dry like to-day I do
nothink, for I haven’t got a penny yet. We
never carries no pockets, for if the policemen
find us we generally pass the money to our
mates, for if money’s found on us we have
fourteen days in prison.</p>

<p>“If I was to reckon all the year round, that
is, one day with another, I think we make fourpence
every day, and if we were to stick to it
we should make more, for on a very muddy
day we do better. One day, the best I ever
had, from nine o’clock in the morning till
seven o’clock at night, I made seven shillings
and sixpence, and got not one bit of silver
money among it. Every shilling I got I went
and left at a shop near where my crossing is,
for fear I might get into any harm. The shop’s
kept by a woman we deals with for what we
wants&mdash;tea and butter, or sugar, or brooms&mdash;anythink
we wants. Saturday night week I
made two-and-sixpence; that’s what I took
altogether up to six o’clock.</p>

<p>“When we see the rain we say together,
‘Oh! there’s a jolly good rain! we’ll have a
good day to-morrow.’ If a shower comes on,
and we are at our room, which we general are
about three o’clock, to get somethink to eat&mdash;besides,
we general go there to see how much
each other’s taken in the day&mdash;why, out we
run with our brooms.</p>

<p>“We’re always sure to make money if there’s
mud&mdash;that’s to say, if we look for our money,
and ask; of course, if we stand still we don’t.
Now, there’s Lord Fitzhardinge, he’s a good
gentleman, what lives in Spring-gardens, in a
large house. He’s got a lot of servants and
carriages. Every time he crosses the Charing-cross
crossing he always gives the girl half a
sovereign.” (This statement was taken in
June 1856.) “He doesn’t cross often, because,
hang it, he’s got such a lot of carriages,
but when he’s on foot he always does. If
they asks him he doesn’t give nothink, but if
they touches their caps he does. The housekeeper
at his house is very kind to us. We
run errands for her, and when she wants
any of her own letters taken to the post then
she calls, and if we are on the crossing we
takes them for her. She’s a very nice lady,
and gives us broken victuals. I’ve got a share
in that crossing,&mdash;there are three of us, and
when he gives the half sovereign he always
gives it to the girl, and those that are in it
shares it. She would do us out of it if she
could, but we all takes good care of that, for
we are all cheats.</p>

<p>“At night-time we tumbles&mdash;that is, if the
policemen ain’t nigh. We goes general to
Waterloo-place when the Opera’s on. We
sends on one of us ahead, as a looker-out, to
look for the policeman, and then we follows.
It’s no good tumbling to gentlemen <i>going</i> to
the Opera; it’s when they’re coming back they
gives us money. When they’ve got a young
lady on their arm they laugh at us tumbling;
some will give us a penny, others threepence,
sometimes a sixpence or a shilling, and sometimes
a halfpenny. We either do the cat’un-wheel,
or else we keep before the gentleman
and lady, turning head-over-heels, putting our
broom on the ground and then turning over it.</p>

<p>“I work a good deal fetching cabs after the
Opera is over; we general open the doors of
those what draw up at the side of the pavement
for people to get into as have walked a little
down the Haymarket looking for a cab. We
gets a month in prison if we touch the others
by the columns. I once had half a sovereign
give me by a gentleman; it was raining awful,
and I run all about for a cab, and at last I got
one. The gentleman knew it was half a
sovereign, because he said&mdash;‘Here, my little
man, here’s half a sovereign for your trouble.’
He had three ladies with him, beautiful ones,
with nothink on their heads, and only capes
on their bare shoulders; and he had white
kids on, and his regular Opera togs, too. I
liked him very much, and as he was going to
give me somethink the ladies says&mdash;‘Oh, give
him somethink extra!’ It was pouring with
rain, and they couldn’t get a cab; they were
all engaged, but I jumped on the box of one
as was driving along the line. Last Saturday
Opera night I made fifteen pence by the gentlemen
coming from the Opera.</p>

<p>“After the Opera we go into the Haymarket,
where all the women are who walk the streets
all night. They don’t give us no money, but
they tell the gentlemen to. Sometimes, when
they are talking to the gentlemen, they say,
‘Go away, you young rascal!’ and if they are
saucy, then we say to them, ‘We’re not talking
to you, my doxy, we’re talking to the gentleman,’&mdash;but
that’s only if they’re rude, for if
they speak civil we always goes. They knows
what ‘doxy’ means. What is it? Why that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
they are no better than us! If we are on the
crossing, and we says to them as they go by,
‘Good luck to you!’ they always give us somethink
either that night or the next. There are
two with bloomer bonnets, who always give us
somethink if we says ‘Good luck.’ Sometimes
a gentleman will tell us to go and get them a
young lady, and then we goes, and they general
gives us sixpence for that. If the gents is
dressed finely we gets them a handsome girl;
if they’re dressed middling, then we gets them
a middling-dressed one; but we usual prefers
giving a turn to girls that have been kind to
us, and they are sure to give us somethink
the next night. If we don’t find any girls
walking, we knows where to get them in the
houses in the streets round about.</p>

<p>“We always meet at St. Martin’s steps&mdash;the
‘jury house,’ we calls ’em&mdash;at three o’clock
in the morning, that’s always our hour. We
reckons up what we’ve taken, but we don’t
divide. Sometimes, if we owe anythink where
we lodge, the women of the house will be
waiting on the steps for us: then, if we’ve got
it, we pay them; if we haven’t, why it can’t be
helped, and it goes on. We gets into debt,
because sometimes the women where we live
gets lushy; then we don’t give them anythink,
because they’d forget it, so we spends it ourselves.
We can’t lodge at what’s called model
lodging-houses, as our hours don’t suit them
folks. We pays threepence a-night for lodging.
Food, if we get plenty of money, we buys for
ourselves. We buys a pound of bread, that’s twopence
farthing&mdash;best seconds, and a farthing’s
worth of dripping&mdash;that’s enough for a pound
of bread&mdash;and we gets a ha’porth of tea and
a ha’porth of sugar; or if we’re hard up, we
gets only a penn’orth of bread. We make our
own tea at home; they lends us a kittle, teapot,
and cups and saucers, and all that.</p>

<p>“Once or twice a-week we gets meat. We
all club together, and go into Newgate Market
and gets some pieces cheap, and biles them at
home. We tosses up who shall have the
biggest bit, and we divide the broth, a cupful
in each basin, until it’s lasted out. If any of
us has been unlucky we each gives the unlucky
one one or two halfpence. Some of us is
obliged at times to sleep out all night; and
sometimes, if any of us gets nothink, then the
others gives him a penny or two, and <i>he</i> does
the same for us when <i>we</i> are out of luck.</p>

<p>“Besides, there’s our clothes: I’m paying
for a pair of boots now. I paid a shilling off
Saturday night.</p>

<p>“When we gets home at half-past three in
the morning, whoever cries out ‘first wash’
has it. First of all we washes our feet, and we
all uses the same water. Then we washes our
faces and hands, and necks, and whoever
fetches the fresh water up has first wash; and
if the second don’t like to go and get fresh,
why he uses the dirty. Whenever we come in
the landlady makes us wash our feet. Very
often the stones cuts our feet and makes them
bleed; then we bind a bit of rag round them.
We like to put on boots and shoes in the daytime,
but at night-time we can’t, because it
stops the tumbling.</p>

<p>“On the Sunday we all have a clean shirt
put on before we go out, and then we go and
tumble after the omnibuses. Sometimes we
do very well on a fine Sunday, when there’s
plenty of people out on the roofs of the busses.
We never do anythink on a wet day, but only
when it’s been raining and then dried up. I
have run after a Cremorne bus, when they’ve
thrown us money, as far as from Charing-cross
right up to Piccadilly, but if they don’t throw
us nothink we don’t run very far. I should
think we gets at that work, taking one Sunday
with another, eightpence all the year round.</p>

<p>“When there’s snow on the ground we puts
our money together, and goes and buys an old
shovel, and then, about seven o’clock in the
morning, we goes to the shops and asks them
if we shall scrape the snow away. We general
gets twopence every house, but some gives
sixpence, for it’s very hard to clean the snow
away, particular when it’s been on the ground
some time. It’s awful cold, and gives us chilblains
on our feet; but we don’t mind it when
we’re working, for we soon gets hot then.</p>

<p>“Before winter comes, we general save up
our money and buys a pair of shoes. Sometimes
we makes a very big snowball and rolls
it up to the hotels, and then the gentlemen
laughs and throws us money; or else we pelt
each other with snowballs, and then they
scrambles money between us. We always go
to Morley’s Hotel, at Charing-cross. The
police in winter times is kinder to us than in
summer, and they only laughs at us;&mdash;p’rhaps
it is because there is not so many of us about
then,&mdash;only them as is obligated to find a
living for themselves; for many of the boys
has fathers and mothers as sends them out in
summer, but keeps them at home in winter
when it’s piercing cold.</p>

<p>“I have been to the station-house, because
the police always takes us up if we are out at
night; but we’re only locked up till morning,&mdash;that
is, if we behaves ourselves when we’re
taken before the gentleman. Mr. Hall, at
Bow-street, only says, ‘Poor boy, let him go.’
But it’s only when we’ve done nothink but
stop out that he says that. He’s a kind old
gentleman; but mind, it’s only when you have
been before him two or three times he says so,
because if it’s a many times, he’ll send you for
fourteen days.</p>

<p>“But we don’t mind the police much at
night-time, because we jumps over the walls
round the place at Trafalgar-square, and they
don’t like to follow us at that game, and only
stands looking at you over the parrypit.
There was one tried to jump the wall, but he
split his trousers all to bits, and now they’re
afraid. That was Old Bandy as bust his
breeches; and we all hate him, as well as
another we calls Black Diamond, what’s general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
along with the Red Liners, as we calls the
Mendicity officers, who goes about in disguise
as gentlemen, to take up poor boys caught
begging.</p>

<p>“When we are talking together we always
talk in a kind of slang. Each policeman we
gives a regular name&mdash;there’s ‘Bull’s Head,’
‘Bandy Shanks,’ and ‘Old Cherry Legs,’ and
‘Dot-and-carry-one;’ they all knows their
names as well as us. We never talks of crossings,
but ‘fakes.’ We don’t make no slang
of our own, but uses the regular one.</p>

<p>“A broom doesn’t last us more than a week
in wet weather, and they costs us twopence
halfpenny each; but in dry weather they are
good for a fortnight.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Young Mike’s Statement.</span></h5>

<p>The next lad I examined was called Mike.
He was a short, stout-set youth, with a face
like an old man’s, for the features were hard
and defined, and the hollows had got filled up
with dirt till his countenance was brown as
an old wood carving. I have seldom seen so
dirty a face, for the boy had been in a perspiration,
and then wiped his cheeks with his
muddy hands, until they were marbled, like
the covering to a copy-book.</p>

<p>The old lady of the house in which the boy
lived seemed to be hurt by the unwashed appearance
of her lodger. “You ought to be
ashamed of yourself&mdash;and that’s God’s truth&mdash;not
to go and sluice yourself afore spaking to
the jintlemin,” she cried, looking alternately
at me and the lad, as if asking me to witness
her indignation.</p>

<p>Mike wore no shoes, but his feet were as
black as if cased in gloves with short fingers.
His coat had been a man’s, and the tails
reached to his ankles; one of the sleeves was
wanting, and a dirty rag had been wound
round the arm in its stead. His hair spread
about like a tuft of grass where a rabbit has
been squatting.</p>

<p>He said, “I haven’t got neither no father
nor no mother,&mdash;never had, sir; for father’s
been dead these two year, and mother getting
on for eight. They was both Irish people,
please sir, and father was a bricklayer. When
father was at work in the country, mother
used to get work carrying loads at Covent-garden
Market. I lived with father till he
died, and that was from a complaint in his
chest. After that I lived along with my big
brother, what’s ’listed in the Marines now.
He used to sweep a crossing in Camden-town,
opposite the Southampting Harms, near the
toll-gate.</p>

<p>“He did pretty well up there sometimes,
such as on Christmas-day, where he has took
as much as six shillings sometimes, and never
less than one and sixpence. All the gentlements
knowed him thereabouts, and one or
two used to give him a shilling a-week regular.</p>

<p>“It was he as first of all put me up to sweep
a crossing, and I used to take my stand at St.
Martin’s Church.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see anybody working there, so I
planted myself on it. After a time some other
boys come up. They come up and wanted to
turn me off, and began hitting me with their
brooms,&mdash;they hit me regular hard with the
old stumps; there was five or six of them; so
I couldn’t defend myself, but told the policeman,
and he turned them all away except me,
because he saw me on first, sir. Now we are
all friends, and work together, and all that we
earns ourself we has.</p>

<p>“On a good day, when it’s poured o’ rain
and then leave off sudden, and made it nice
and muddy, I’ve took as much as ninepence;
but it’s too dry now, and we don’t do more
than fourpence.</p>

<p>“At night, I go along with the others
tumbling. I does the cat’en-wheel [probably
a contraction of Catherine-wheel]; I throws
myself over sideways on my hands with my
legs in the air. I can’t do it more than four
times running, because it makes the blood to
the head, and then all the things seems to
turn round. Sometimes a chap will give me
a lick with a stick just as I’m going over&mdash;sometimes
a reg’lar good hard whack; but it
ain’t often, and we general gets a halfpenny or
a penny by it.</p>

<p>“The boys as runs after the busses was the
first to do these here cat’en-wheels. I know
the boy as was the very first to do it. His
name is Gander, so we calls him the Goose.</p>

<p>“There’s about nine or ten of us in our
gang, and as is reg’lar; we lodges at different
places, and we has our reg’lar hours for meeting,
but we all comes and goes when we likes,
only we keeps together, so as not to let any
others come on the crossings but ourselves.</p>

<p>“If another boy tries to come on we cries
out, ‘Here’s a Rooshian,’ and then if he won’t
go away, we all sets on him and gives him a
drubbing; and if he still comes down the next
day, we pays him out twice as much, and
harder.</p>

<p>“There’s never been one down there yet as
can lick us all together.</p>

<p>“If we sees one of our pals being pitched
into by other boys, we goes up and helps him.
Gander’s the leader of our gang, ’cause he can
tumble back’ards (no, that ain’t the cat’en-wheel,
that’s tumbling); so he gets more tin
give him, and that’s why we makes him cap’an.</p>

<p>“After twelve at night we goes to the Regent’s
Circus, and we tumbles there to the
gentlemen and ladies. The most I ever got
was sixpence at a time. The French ladies
never give us nothink, but they all says, ‘Chit,
chit, chit,’ like hissing at us, for they can’t
understand us, and we’re as bad off with them.</p>

<p>“If it’s a wet night we leaves off work about
twelve o’clock, and don’t bother with the Haymarket.</p>

<p>“The first as gets to the crossing does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
sweeping away of the mud. Then they has in
return all the halfpence they can take. When
it’s been wet every day, a broom gets down to
stump in about four days. We either burns
the old brooms, or, if we can, we sells ’em
for a ha’penny to some other boy, if he’s flat
enough to buy ’em.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Gander&mdash;The “Captain” of the Boy
Crossing-Sweepers.</span></h5>

<p>Gander, the captain of the gang of boy crossing-sweepers,
was a big lad of sixteen, with a
face devoid of all expression, until he laughed,
when the cheeks, mouth, and forehead instantly
became crumpled up with a wonderful
quantity of lines and dimples. His hair was
cut short, and stood up in all directions, like
the bristles of a hearth-broom, and was a light
dust tint, matching with the hue of his complexion,
which also, from an absence of washing,
had turned to a decided drab, or what
house-painters term a stone-colour.</p>

<p>He spoke with a lisp, occasioned by the loss
of two of his large front teeth, which allowed
the tongue as he talked to appear through the
opening in a round nob like a raspberry.</p>

<p>The boy’s clothing was in a shocking condition.
He had no coat, and his blue-striped
shirt was as dirty as a French-polisher’s rags,
and so tattered, that the shoulder was completely
bare, while the sleeve hung down over
the hand like a big bag.</p>

<p>From the fish-scales on the sleeves of his
coat, it had evidently once belonged to some
coster in the herring line. The nap was all
worn off, so that the lines of the web were
showing like a coarse carpet; and instead of
buttons, string had been passed through holes
pierced at the side.</p>

<p>Of course he had no shoes on, and his black
trousers, which, with the grease on them, were
gradually assuming a tarpaulin look, were
fastened over one shoulder by means of a
brace and bits of string.</p>

<p>During his statement, he illustrated his account
of the tumbling backwards&mdash;the “caten-wheeling”&mdash;with
different specimens of the
art, throwing himself about on the floor with
an ease and almost grace, and taking up so
small a space of the ground for the performance,
that his limbs seemed to bend as though
his bones were flexible like cane.</p>

<p>“To tell you the blessed truth, I can’t say
the last shilling I handled.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you go a-believing on him,” whispered
another lad in my ear, whilst Gander’s head
was turned: “he took thirteenpence last night,
he did.”</p>

<p>It was perfectly impossible to obtain from
this lad any account of his average earnings.
The other boys in the gang told me that he
made more than any of them. But Gander,
who is a thorough street-beggar, and speaks
with a peculiar whine, and who, directly you
look at him, puts on an expression of deep
distress, seemed to have made up his mind,
that if he made himself out to be in great want
I should most likely relieve him&mdash;so he would
not budge an inch from his twopence a-day,
declaring it to be the maximum of his daily
earnings.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he continued, with a persecuted tone
of voice, “if I had only got a little money, I’d
be a bright youth! The first chance as I get
of earning a few halfpence, I’ll buy myself
a coat, and be off to the country, and I’ll
lay something I’d soon be a gentleman then,
and come home with a couple of pounds in my
pocket, instead of never having ne’er a farthing,
as now.”</p>

<p>One of the other lads here exclaimed,
“Don’t go on like that there, Goose; you’re
making us out all liars to the gentleman.”</p>

<p>The old woman also interfered. She lost
all patience with Gander, and reproached him
for making a false return of his income. She
tried to shame him into truthfulness, by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Look at my Johnny&mdash;my grandson, sir,
he’s not a quarther the Goose’s size, and yet
he’ll bring me home his shilling, or perhaps
eighteenpence or two shillings&mdash;for shame on
you, Gander! Now, did you make six shillings
last week?&mdash;now, speak God’s truth!”</p>

<p>“What! six shillings?” cried the Goose&mdash;“six
shillings!” and he began to look up at the
ceiling, and shake his hands. “Why, I never
heard of sich a sum. I did once <i>see</i> a half-crown;
but I don’t know as I ever touched e’er
a one.”</p>

<p>“Thin,” added the old woman, indignantly,
“it’s because you’re idle, Gander, and you don’t
study when you’re on the crossing; but lets the
gintlefolk go by without ever a word. That’s
what it is, sir.”</p>

<p>The Goose seemed to feel the truth of this
reproach, for he said with a sigh, “I knows I
am fickle-minded.”</p>

<p>He then continued his statement,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I can’t tell how many brooms I use; for as
fast as I gets one, it is took from me. God
help me! They watch me put it away, and
then up they comes and takes it. What kinds
of brooms is the best? Why, as far as I am concerned,
I would sooner have a stump on a dry
day&mdash;it’s lighter and handier to carry; but on
a wet day, give me a new un.</p>

<p>“I’m sixteen, your honour, and my name’s
George Gandea, and the boys calls me ‘the
Goose’ in consequence; for it’s a nickname
they gives me, though my name ain’t spelt with
a <i>har</i> at the end, but with a <i>h’ay</i>, so that I ain’t
Gand<i>er</i> after all, but Gand<i>ea</i>, which is a sell
for ’em.</p>

<p>“God knows what I am&mdash;whether I’m
h’Irish or h’<i>I</i>talian, or what; but I was christened
here in London, and that’s all about it.</p>

<p>“Father was a bookbinder. I’m sixteen
now, and father turned me away when I was
nine year old, for mother had been dead before
that. I was told my right name by my brother-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>in-law,
who had my register. He’s a sweep,
sir, by trade, and I wanted to know about my
real name when I was going down to the
<i>Waterloo</i>&mdash;that’s a ship as I wanted to get
aboard as a cabin-boy.</p>

<p>“I remember the fust night I slept out
after father got rid of me. I slept on a gentleman’s
door-step, in the winter, on the
15th January. I packed my shirt and coat,
which was a pretty good one, right over my
ears, and then scruntched myself into a doorway,
and the policeman passed by four or five
times without seeing on me.</p>

<p>“I had a mother-in-law at the time; but
father used to drink, or else I should never
have been as I am; and he came home one
night, and says he, ‘Go out and get me a few
ha’pence for breakfast,’ and I said I had never
been in the streets in my life, and couldn’t;
and, says he, ‘Go out, and never let me see
you no more,’ and I took him to his word, and
have never been near him since.</p>

<p>“Father lived in Barbican at that time, and
after leaving him, I used to go to the Royal
Exchange, and there I met a boy of the name
of Michael, and he first learnt me to beg, and
made me run after people, saying, ‘Poor boy,
sir&mdash;please give us a ha’penny to get a mossel
of bread.’ But as fast as I got anythink, he
used to take it away, and knock me about
shameful; so I left him, and then I picked up
with a chap as taught me tumbling. I soon
larnt how to do it, and then I used to go
tumbling after busses. That was my notion
all along, and I hadn’t picked up the way of
doing it half an hour before I was after that
game.</p>

<p>“I took to crossings about eight year ago,
and the very fust person as I asked, I had a
fourpenny-piece give to me. I said to him,
‘Poor little Jack, yer honour,’ and, fust of all,
says he, ‘I haven’t got no coppers,’ and then
he turns back and give me a fourpenny-bit.
I thought I was made for life when I got that.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t working in a gang then, but all by
myself, and I used to do well, making about a
shilling or ninepence a-day. I lodged in Church-lane
at that time.</p>

<p>“It was at the time of the Shibition year
(1851) as these gangs come up. There was
lots of boys that came out sweeping, and that’s
how they picked up the tumbling off me, seeing
me do it up in the Park, going along to the
Shibition.</p>

<p>“The crossing at St. Martin’s Church was
mine fust of all; and when the other lads
come to it I didn’t take no heed of ’em&mdash;only
for that I’d have been a bright boy by now,
but they carnied me over like; for when I
tried to turn ’em off they’d say, in a carnying
way, ‘Oh, let us stay on,’ so I never took no
heed of ’em.</p>

<p>“There was about thirteen of ’em in my
gang at that time.</p>

<p>“They made me cap’an over the lot&mdash;I
suppose because they thought I was the best
tumbler of ’em. They obeyed me a little. If
I told ’em not to go to any gentleman, they
wouldn’t, and leave him to me. There was
only one feller as used to give me a share of
his money, and that was for larning him to
tumble&mdash;he’d give a penny or twopence, just
as he yearnt a little or a lot. I taught ’em all
to tumble, and we used to do it near the
crossing, and at night along the streets.</p>

<p>“We used to be sometimes together of a
day, some a-running after one gentleman, and
some after another; but we seldom kept together
more than three or four at a time.</p>

<p>“I was the fust to introduce tumbling backards,
and I’m proud of it&mdash;yes, sir, I’m proud
of it. There’s another little chap as I’m larning
to do it; but he ain’t got strength enough
in his arms like. (‘Ah!’ exclaimed a lad in
the room, ‘he <i>is</i> a one to tumble, is Johnny&mdash;go
along the streets like anythink.’)</p>

<p>“He is the King of the Tumblers,” continued
Gander&mdash;“King, and I’m Cap’an.”</p>

<p>The old grandmother here joined in. “He
was taught by a furreign gintleman, sir, whose
wife rode at a circus. He used to come here
twice a-day and give him lessons in this here
very room, sir. That’s how he got it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” added another lad, in an admiring
tone, “see him and the Goose have a race!
Away they goes, but Jacky will leave him a
mile behind.”</p>

<p>The history then continued:&mdash;“People liked
the tumbling backards and forards, and it got
a good bit of money at fust, but they is getting
tired with it, and I’m growing too hold, I fancy.
It hurt me awful at fust. I tried it fust under
a railway arch of the Blackwall Railway; and
when I goes backards, I thought it’d cut my
head open. It hurts me if I’ve got a thin cap
on.</p>

<p>“The man as taught me tumbling has gone
on the stage. Fust he went about with swords,
fencing, in public-houses, and then he got engaged.
Me and him once tumbled all round
the circus at the Rotunda one night wot was
a benefit, and got one-and-eightpence a-piece,
and all for only five hours and a half&mdash;from
six to half-past eleven, and we acting and
tumbling, and all that. We had plenty of
beer, too. We was wery much applauded
when we did it.</p>

<p>“I was the fust boy as ever did ornamental
work in the mud of my crossings. I used to
be at the crossing at the corner of Regent-suckus;
and that’s the wery place where I
fust did it. The wery fust thing as I did was
a hanker (anchor)&mdash;a regular one, with turn-up
sides and a rope down the centre, and all.
I sweeped it away clean in the mud in the
shape of the drawing I’d seen. It paid well,
for I took one-and-ninepence on it. The next
thing I tried was writing ‘God save the Queen;’
and that, too, paid capital, for I think I got
two bob. After that I tried We Har (V. R.)
and a star, and that was a sweep too. I never
did no flowers, but I’ve done imitations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
laurels, and put them all round the crossing,
and very pretty it looked, too, at night. I’d
buy a farthing candle and stick it over it, and
make it nice and comfortable, so that the
people could look at it easy. Whenever I see
a carriage coming I used to douse the glim
and run away with it, but the wheels would
regularly spile the drawings, and then we’d
have all the trouble to put it to rights again,
and that we used to do with our hands.</p>

<p>“I fust learnt drawing in the mud from a
man in Adelaide-street, Strand; he kept a
crossing, but he only used to draw ’em close
to the kerb-stone. He used to keep some soft
mud there, and when a carriage come up to
the Lowther Arcade, after he’d opened the
door and let the lady out, he would set to
work, and by the time she come back he’d
have some flowers, or a We Har, or whatever
he liked, done in the mud, and underneath
he’d write, ‘Please to remember honnest hindustry.’</p>

<p>“I used to stand by and see him do it, until
I’d learnt, and when I knowed, I went off and
did it at my crossing.</p>

<p>“I was the fust to light up at night though,
and now I wish I’d never done it, for it was
that which got me turned off my crossing, and
a capital one it was. I thought the gentlemen
coming from the play would like it, for it looked
very pretty. The policeman said I was destructing
(obstructing) the thoroughfare, and
making too much row there, for the people
used to stop in the crossing to look, it were so
pretty. He took me in charge three times on
one night, cause I wouldn’t go away; but he
let me go again, till at last I thought he would
lock me up for the night, so I hooked it.</p>

<p>“It was after this as I went to St. Martin’s
Church, and I haven’t done half as well there.
Last night I took three-ha’pence; but I was
larking, or I might have had more.”</p>

<p>As a proof of the very small expense which
is required for the toilette of a crossing-sweeper,
I may mention, that within a few
minutes after Master Gander had finished his
statement, he was in possession of a coat, for
which he had paid the sum of fivepence.</p>

<p>When he brought it into the room, all the
boys and the women crowded round to see the
purchase.</p>

<p>“It’s a very good un,” said the Goose. “It
only wants just taking up here and there; and
this cuff putting to rights.” And as he spoke
he pointed to tears large enough for a head to
be thrust through.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen that coat before, sum’ares,” said
one of the women; “where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“At the chandly-shop,” answered the Goose.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The “King” of the Tumbling-Boy
Crossing-Sweepers.</span></h5>

<p>The young sweeper who had been styled
by his companions the “King” was a pretty-looking
boy, only tall enough to rest his
chin comfortably on the mantel-piece as he
talked to me, and with a pair of grey eyes that
were as bright and clear as drops of sea-water.
He was clad in a style in no way agreeing with
his royal title; for he had on a kind of dirt-coloured
shooting-coat of tweed, which was
fraying into a kind of cobweb at the edges and
elbows. His trousers too, were rather faulty,
for there was a pink-wrinkled dot of flesh at
one of the knees; while their length was too
great for his majesty’s short legs, so that they
had to be rolled up at the end like a washerwoman’s
sleeves.</p>

<p>His royal highness was of a restless disposition,
and, whilst talking, lifted up, one after
another, the different ornaments on the mantel-piece,
frowning and looking at them sideways,
as he pondered over the replies he should
make to my questions.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the grandmother’s apartment
the “king” was absent, his majesty
having been sent with a pitcher to fetch some
spring-water.</p>

<p>The “king” also was kind enough to favour
me with samples of his wondrous tumbling
powers. He could bend his little legs round
till they curved like the long German sausages
we see in the ham-and-beef shops; and when
he turned head over heels, he curled up his
tiny body as closely as a wood-louse, and then
rolled along, wabbling like an egg.</p>

<p>“The boys call me Johnny,” he said; “and
I’m getting on for eleven, and I goes along
with the Goose and Harry, a-sweeping at St.
Martin’s Church, and about there. I used, too,
to go to the crossing where the statute is, sir,
at the bottom of the Haymarket. I went along
with the others; sometimes there were three
or four of us, or sometimes one, sir. I never
used to sweep unless it was wet. I don’t go
out not before twelve or one in the day; it
ain’t no use going before that; and beside, I
couldn’t get up before that, I’m too sleepy.
I don’t stop out so late as the other boys; they
sometimes stop all night, but I don’t like that.
The Goose was out all night along with Martin;
they went all along up Piccirilly, and
there they climbed over the Park railings and
went a birding all by themselves, and then
they went to sleep for an hour on the grass&mdash;so
they says. I likes better to come home to
my bed. It kills me for the next day when I
do stop out all night. The Goose is always
out all night; he likes it.</p>

<p>“Neither father nor mother’s alive, sir, but
I lives along with grandmother and aunt, as
owns this room, and I always gives them all
I gets.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I makes a shilling, sometimes
sixpence, and sometimes less. I can never
take nothink of a day, only of a night, because
I can’t tumble of a day, and I can of a night.</p>

<p>“The Gander taught me tumbling, and he
was the first as did it along the crossings. I
can tumble quite as well as the Goose; I can
turn a caten-wheel, and he can’t, and I can go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
further on forards than him, but I can’t tumble
backards as he can. I can’t do a handspring,
though. Why, a handspring’s pitching yourself
forards on both hands, turning over in front,
and lighting on your feet; that’s very difficult,
and very few can do it. There’s one little
chap, but he’s very clever, and can tie himself
up in a knot a’most. I’m best at caten-wheels;
I can do ’em twelve or fourteen times running&mdash;keep
on at it. It just <i>does</i> tire you, that’s
all. When I gets up I feels quite giddy. I
can tumble about forty times over head and
heels. I does the most of that, and I thinks
it’s the most difficult, but I can’t say which
gentlemen likes best. You see they are anigh
sick of the head-and-heels tumbling, and then
werry few of the boys can do caten-wheels on
the crossings&mdash;only two or three besides me.</p>

<p>“When I see anybody coming, I says,
‘Please, sir, give me a halfpenny,’ and touches
my hair, and then I throws a caten-wheel, and
has a look at ’em, and if I sees they are laughing,
then I goes on and throws more of ’em.
Perhaps one in ten will give a chap something.
Some of ’em will give you a threepenny-bit or
p’rhaps sixpence, and others only give you a
kick. Well, sir, I should say they likes tumbling
over head and heels; if you can keep it
up twenty times then they begins laughing,
but if you only does it once, some of ’em will
say, ‘Oh, I could do that myself,’ and then they
don’t give nothink.</p>

<p>“I know they calls me the King of Tumblers,
and I think I can tumble the best of
them; none of them is so good as me, only
the Goose at tumbling backards.</p>

<p>“We don’t crab one another when we are
sweeping; if we was to crab one another, we’d
get to fighting and giving slaps of the jaw to
one another. So when we sees anybody coming,
we cries, ‘My gentleman and lady coming
here;’ ‘My lady;’ ‘My two gentlemens;’ and
if any other chap gets the money, then we says,
‘I named them, now I’ll have halves.’ And if
he won’t give it, then we’ll smug his broom or
his cap. I’m the littlest chap among our lot,
but if a fellow like the Goose was to take my
naming then I’d smug somethink. I shouldn’t
mind his licking me, I’d smug his money and
get his halfpence or somethink. If a chap as
can’t tumble sees a sporting gent coming and
names him, he says to one of us tumblers,
‘Now, then, who’ll give us halves?’ and then
we goes and tumbles and shares. The sporting
gentlemens likes tumbling; they kicks up
more row laughing than a dozen others.</p>

<p>“Sometimes at night we goes down to
Covent Garden, to where Hevans’s is, but not
till all the plays is over, cause Hevans’s don’t
shut afore two or three. When the people
comes out we gets tumbling afore them. Some
of the drunken gentlemens is shocking spiteful,
and runs after a chap and gives us a cut
with the cane; some of the others will give
us money, and some will buy our broom off us
for sixpence. Me and Jemmy sold the two of
our brooms for a shilling to two drunken gentlemens,
and they began kicking up a row, and
going before other gentlemens and pretending
to sweep, and taking off their hats begging,
like a mocking of us. They danced about with
the brooms, flourishing ’em in the air, and
knocking off people’s hats; and at last they
got into a cab, and chucked the brooms away.
The drunken gentlemens is always either jolly
or spiteful.</p>

<p>“But I goes only to the Haymarket, and
about Pall Mall, now. I used to be going up
to Hevans’s every night, but I can’t take my
money up there now. I stands at the top of
the Haymarket by Windmill-street, and when
I sees a lady and gentleman coming out of the
Argyle, then I begs of them as they comes
across. I says&mdash;‘Can’t you give me a ha’penny,
sir, poor little Jack? I’ll stand on my nose for
a penny;’&mdash;and then they laughs at that.</p>

<p>“Goose can stand on his nose as well as
me; we puts the face flat down on the ground,
instead of standing on our heads. There’s
Duckey Dunnovan, and the Stuttering Baboon,
too, and two others as well, as can do it; but
the Stuttering Baboon’s getting too big and fat
to do it well; he’s a very awkward tumbler.
It don’t hurt, only at larning; cos you bears
more on your hands than your nose.</p>

<p>“Sometimes they says&mdash;‘Well, let us see
you do it,’ and then p’raps they’ll search in
their pockets, and say&mdash;‘O, I haven’t got any
coppers:’ so then we’ll force ’em, and p’raps
they’ll pull out their purse and gives us a little
bit of silver.</p>

<p>“Ah, we works hard for what we gets, and
then there’s the policemen birching us. Some
of ’em is so spiteful, they takes up their belt
what they uses round the waist to keep their
coat tight, and’ll hit us with the buckle; but
we generally gives ’em the lucky dodge and
gets out of their way.</p>

<p>“One night, two gentlemen, officers they
was, was standing in the Haymarket, and
a drunken man passed by. There was snow on
the ground, and we’d been begging of ’em, and
says one of them&mdash;‘I’ll give you a shilling if
you’ll knock that drunken man over.’ We was
three of us; so we set on him, and soon had
him down. After he got up he went and told
the policemen, but we all cut round different
ways and got off, and then met again. We
didn’t get the shilling, though, cos a boy
crabbed us. He went up to the gentleman,
and says he&mdash;‘Give it me, sir, I’m the boy;’
and then we says&mdash;‘No, sir, it’s us.’ So, says
the officer&mdash;‘I sharn’t give it to none of you,’
and puts it back again in his pockets. We
broke a broom over the boy as crabbed us, and
then we cut down Waterloo-place, and afterwards
we come up to the Haymarket again,
and there we met the officers again. I did a
caten-wheel, and then says I&mdash;‘Then won’t
you give me un now?’ and they says&mdash;‘Go
and sweep some mud on that woman.’ So I
went and did it, and then they takes me in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
pastry-shop at the corner, and they tells me to
tumble on the tables in the shop. I nearly
broke one of ’em, they were so delicate. They
gived me a fourpenny meat-pie and two penny
sponge-cakes, which I puts in my pocket, cos
there was another sharing with me. The lady
of the shop kept on screaming&mdash;‘Go and fetch
me a police&mdash;take the dirty boy out,’ cos I was
standing on the tables in my muddy feet, and
the officers was a bursting their sides with
laughing; and says they, ‘No, he sharn’t
stir.’</p>

<p>“I was frightened, cos if the police had
come they’d been safe and sure to have took
me. They made me tumble from the door to
the end of the shop, and back again, and then
I turned ’em a caten-wheel, and was near
knocking down all the things as was on the
counter.</p>

<p>“They didn’t give me no money, only pies;
but I got a shilling another time for tumbling
to some French ladies and gentlemen in a
pastry-cook’s shop under the Colonnade. I
often goes into a shop like that; I’ve done it
a good many times.</p>

<p>“There was a gentleman once as belonged to
a ‘suckus,’ (circus) as wanted to take me with
him abroad, and teach me tumbling. He had
a little mustache, and used to belong to Drury-lane
play-house, riding on horses. I went to
his place, and stopped there some time. He
taught me to put my leg round my neck, and
I was just getting along nicely with the splits
(going down on the ground with both legs
extended), when I left him. They (the splits)
used to hurt worst of all; very bad for the
thighs. I used, too, to hang with my leg round
his neck. When I did anythink he liked, he
used to be clapping me on the back. He
wasn’t so very stunning well off, for he never
had what I calls a good dinner&mdash;grandmother
used to have a better dinner than he,&mdash;perhaps
only a bit of scrag of mutton between
three of us. I don’t like meat nor butter, but
I likes dripping, and they never had none
there. The wife used to drink&mdash;ay, very much,
on the sly. She used when he was out to
send me round with a bottle and sixpence to
get a quartern of gin for her, and she’d take
it with three or four oysters. Grandmother
didn’t like the notion of my going away, so
she went down one day, and says she&mdash;‘I
wants my child;’ and the wife says&mdash;‘That’s
according to the master’s likings;’ and then
grandmother says&mdash;‘What, not my own child?’
And then grandmother began talking, and at
last, when the master come home, he says to
me&mdash;‘Which will you do, stop here, or go
home with your grandmother?’ So I come
along with her.</p>

<p>“I’ve been sweeping the crossings getting
on for two years. Before that I used to go
caten-wheeling after the busses. I don’t like
the sweeping, and I don’t think there’s e’er a
one of us wot likes it. In the winter we has
to be out in the cold, and then in summer we
have to sleep out all night, or go asleep on
the church-steps, reg’lar tired out.</p>

<p>“One of us’ll say at night&mdash;‘Oh, I’m sleepy
now, who’s game for a doss? I’m for a doss;’&mdash;and
then we go eight or ten of us into a
doorway of the church, where they keep the
dead in a kind of airy-like underneath, and
there we go to sleep. The most of the boys
has got no homes. Perhaps they’ve got the
price of a lodging, but they’re hungry, and
they eats the money, and then they must lay
out. There’s some of ’em will stop out in the
wet for perhaps the sake of a halfpenny, and
get themselves sopping wet. I think all our
chaps would like to get out of the work if
they could; I’m sure Goose would, and so
would I.</p>

<p>“All the boys call me the King, because I
tumbles so well, and some calls me ‘Pluck,’
and some ‘Judy.’ I’m called ‘Pluck,’ cause
I’m so plucked a going at the gentlemen!
Tommy Dunnovan&mdash;‘Tipperty Tight’&mdash;we
calls him, cos his trousers is so tight he can
hardly move in them sometimes,&mdash;he was the
first as called me ‘Judy.’ Dunnovan once
swallowed a pill for a shilling. A gentleman
in the Haymarket says&mdash;‘If you’ll swallow
this here pill I’ll give you a shilling;’ and
Jimmy says, ‘All right, sir;’ and he puts it
in his mouth, and went to the water-pails near
the cab-stand and swallowed it.</p>

<p>“All the chaps in our gang likes me, and
we all likes one another. We always shows
what we gets given to us to eat.</p>

<p>“Sometimes we gets one another up wild,
and then that fetches up a fight, but that isn’t
often. When two of us fights, the others stands
round and sees fair play. There was a fight
last night between ‘Broke his Bones’&mdash;as we
calls Antony Hones&mdash;and Neddy Hall&mdash;the
‘Sparrow,’ or ‘Spider,’ we calls him,&mdash;something
about the root of a pineapple, as we was
aiming with at one another, and that called up
a fight. We all stood round and saw them at
it, but neither of ’em licked, for they gived in
for to-day, and they’re to finish it to-night.
We makes ’em fight fair. We all of us likes
to see a fight, but not to fight ourselves. Hones
is sure to beat, as Spider is as thin as a wafer,
and all bones. I can lick the Spider, though
he’s twice my size.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Street where the Boy-Sweepers
lodged.</span></h5>

<p>I was anxious to see the room in which the
gang of boy crossing-sweepers lived, so that I
might judge of their peculiar style of house-keeping,
and form some notion of their principles
of domestic economy.</p>

<p>I asked young Harry and “the Goose” to
conduct me to their lodgings, and they at
once consented, “the Goose” prefacing his
compliance with the remark, that “it wern’t
such as genilmen had been accustomed to, but
then I must take ’em as they was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys led me in the direction of Drury-lane;
and before entering one of the narrow
streets which branch off like the side-bones
of a fish’s spine from that long thoroughfare,
they thought fit to caution me that I was not
to be frightened, as nobody would touch me,
for all was very civil.</p>

<p>The locality consisted of one of those narrow
streets which, were it not for the paved cartway
in the centre would be called a court.
Seated on the pavement at each side of the
entrance was a costerwoman with her basket
before her, and her legs tucked up mysteriously
under her gown into a round ball,
so that her figure resembled in shape the
plaster tumblers sold by the Italians. These
women remained as inanimate as if they had
been carved images, and it was only when a
passenger went by that they gave signs of life,
by calling out in a low voice, like talking to
themselves, “Two for three haarpence&mdash;herrens,”&mdash;“Fine
hinguns.”</p>

<p>The street itself is like the description given
of thoroughfares in the East. Opposite neighbours
could not exactly shake hands out of
window, but they could talk together very
comfortably; and, indeed, as I passed along,
I observed several women with their arms
folded up like a cat’s paws on the sill, and
chatting with their friends over the way.</p>

<p>Nearly all the inhabitants were costermongers,
and, indeed, the narrow cartway seemed
to have been made just wide enough for a truck
to wheel down it. A beershop and a general
store, together with a couple of sweeps,&mdash;whose
residences were distinguished by a
broom over the door,&mdash;formed the only
exceptions to the street-selling class of inhabitants.</p>

<p>As I entered the place, it gave me the notion
that it belonged to a distinct coster
colony, and formed one large hawkers’ home;
for everybody seemed to be doing just as
he liked, and I was stared at as if considered
an intruder. Women were seated on
the pavement, knitting, and repairing their
linen; the doorways were filled up with bonnetless
girls, who wore their shawls over
their head, as the Spanish women do their
mantillas; and the youths in corduroy and
brass buttons, who were chatting with them,
leant against the walls as they smoked their
pipes, and blocked up the pavement, as if they
were the proprietors of the place. Little children
formed a convenient bench out of the kerb-stone;
and a party of four men were seated on
the footway, playing with cards which had
turned to the colour of brown paper from long
usage, and marking the points with chalk upon
the flags.</p>

<p>The parlour-windows of the houses had
all of them wooden shutters, as thick and
clumsy-looking as a kitchen flap-table, the
paint of which had turned to the dull dirt-colour
of an old slate. Some of these shutters
were evidently never used as a security for the
dwelling, but served only as tables on which
to chalk the accounts of the day’s sales.</p>

<p>Before most of the doors were costermongers’
trucks&mdash;some standing ready to be wheeled
off, and others stained and muddy with the
day’s work. A few of the costers were dressing
up their barrows, arranging the sieves of
waxy-looking potatoes&mdash;and others taking the
stiff herrings, browned like a meerschaum with
the smoke they had been dried in, from the
barrels beside them, and spacing them out in
pennyworths on their trays.</p>

<p>You might guess what each costermonger had
taken out that day by the heap of refuse swept
into the street before the doors. One house
had a blue mound of mussel-shells in front of
it&mdash;another, a pile of the outside leaves of
broccoli and cabbages, turning yellow and slimy
with bruises and moisture.</p>

<p>Hanging up beside some of the doors were
bundles of old strawberry pottles, stained red
with the fruit. Over the trap-doors to the
cellars were piles of market-gardeners’ sieves,
ruddled like a sheep’s back with big red letters.
In fact, everything that met the eye
seemed to be in some way connected with the
coster’s trade.</p>

<p>From the windows poles stretched out, on
which blankets, petticoats, and linen were drying;
and so numerous were they, that they
reminded me of the flags hung out at a Paris
fête. Some of the sheets had patches as big
as trap-doors let into their centres; and the
blankets were&mdash;many of them&mdash;as full of holes
as a pigeon-house.</p>

<p>As I entered the court, a “row” was going
on; and from a first-floor window a lady, whose
hair sadly wanted brushing, was haranguing a
crowd beneath, throwing her arms about like
a drowning man, and in her excitement thrusting
her body half out of her temporary rostrum
as energetically as I have seen Punch lean
over his theatre.</p>

<p>“The willin dragged her,” she shouted, “by
the hair of her head, at least three yards into
the court&mdash;the willin! and then he kicked
her, and the blood was on his boot.”</p>

<p>It was a sweep who had been behaving in
this cowardly manner; but still he had his
defenders in the women around him. One
with very shiny hair, and an Indian kerchief
round her neck, answered the lady in the
window, by calling her a “<span class="lock">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> old cat;”
whilst the sweep’s wife rushed about, clapping
her hands together as quickly as if she was
applauding at a theatre, and styled somebody
or other “an old wagabones as she wouldn’t
dirty her hands to fight with.”</p>

<p>This “row” had the effect of drawing all
the lodgers to the windows&mdash;their heads popping
out as suddenly as dogs from their kennels
in a fancier’s yard.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">The Boy-Sweepers’ Room.</span></h5>

<p>The room where the boys lodged was scarcely
bigger than a coach-house; and so low was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
the ceiling, that a fly-paper suspended from a
clothes-line was on a level with my head, and
had to be carefully avoided when I moved
about.</p>

<p>One corner of the apartment was completely
filled up by a big four-post bedstead, which
fitted into a kind of recess as perfectly as if it
had been built to order.</p>

<p>The old woman who kept this lodging had
endeavoured to give it a homely look of comfort,
by hanging little black-framed pictures,
scarcely bigger than pocket-books, on the
walls. Most of these were sacred subjects,
with large yellow glories round the heads;
though between the drawing representing the
bleeding heart of Christ, and the Saviour
bearing the Cross, was an illustration of a
red-waistcoated sailor smoking his pipe. The
Adoration of the Shepherds, again, was matched
on the other side of the fireplace by a portrait
of Daniel O’Connell.</p>

<p>A chest of drawers was covered over with a
green baize cloth, on which books, shelves,
and clean glasses were tidily set out.</p>

<p>Where so many persons (for there were about
eight of them, including the landlady, her
daughter, and grandson) could all sleep,
puzzled me extremely.</p>

<p>The landlady wore a frilled nightcap, which
fitted so closely to the skull, that it was evident
she had lost her hair. One of her eyes was
slowly recovering from a blow, which, to use
her own words, “a blackgeyard gave her.”
Her lip, too, had suffered in the encounter,
for it was swollen and cut.</p>

<p>“I’ve a nice flock-bid for the boys,” she
said, when I inquired into the accommodation
of her lodging-house, “where three of them
can slape aisy and comfortable.”</p>

<p>“It’s a large bed, sir,” said one of the boys,
“and a warm covering over us; and you see
it’s better than a regular lodging-house; for,
if you want a knife or a cup, you don’t have to
leave something on it till it’s returned.”</p>

<p>The old woman spoke up for her lodgers,
telling me that they were good boys, and very
honest; “for,” she added, “they pays me
rig’lar ivery night, which is threepence.”</p>

<p>The only youth as to whose morals she
seemed to be at all doubtful was “the Goose,”
“for he kept late hours, and sometimes came
home without a penny in his pocket.”</p>


<h4><i>B. The Girl Crossing-Sweepers.</i></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Girl Crossing-Sweeper sent out by
her Father.</span></h5>

<p>A little girl, who worked by herself at her own
crossing, gave me some curious information on
the subject.</p>

<p>This child had a peculiarly flat face, with a
button of a nose, while her mouth was scarcely
larger than a button-hole. When she spoke,
there was not the slightest expression visible
in her features; indeed, one might have fancied
she wore a mask and was talking
behind it; but her eyes were shining the
while as brightly as those of a person in a
fever, and kept moving about, restless with her
timidity. The green frock she wore was fastened
close to the neck, and was turning into
a kind of mouldy tint; she also wore a black
stuff apron, stained with big patches of gruel,
“from feeding baby at home,” as she said.
Her hair was tidily dressed, being drawn
tightly back from the forehead, like the buy-a-broom
girls; and as she stood with her hands
thrust up her sleeves, she curtseyed each
time before answering, bobbing down like a
float, as though the floor under her had suddenly
given way.</p>

<p>“I’m twelve years old, please sir, and my
name is Margaret <span class="lock">R&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and I sweep a crossing
in New Oxford-street, by Dunn’s-passage,
just facing Moses and Sons’, sir; by the Catholic
school, sir. Mother’s been dead these
two year, sir, and father’s a working cutler,
sir; and I lives with him, but he don’t get
much to do, and so I’m obligated to help him,
doing what I can, sir. Since mother’s been
dead, I’ve had to mind my little brother and
sister, so that I haven’t been to school; but
when I goes a crossing-sweeping I takes them
along with me, and they sits on the steps close
by, sir. If it’s wet I has to stop at home and
take care of them, for father depends upon
me for looking after them. Sister’s three and
a-half year old, and brother’s five year, so he’s
just beginning to help me, sir. I hope he’ll
get something better than a crossing when he
grows up.</p>

<p>“First of all I used to go singing songs in
the streets, sir. It was when father had no
work, so he stopped at home and looked after
the children. I used to sing the ‘Red, White,
and Blue,’ and ‘Mother, is the Battle over?’
and ‘The Gipsy Girl,’ and sometimes I’d get
fourpence or fivepence, and sometimes I’d have
a chance of making ninepence, sir. Sometimes,
though, I’d take a shilling of a Saturday
night in the markets.</p>

<p>“At last the songs grew so stale people
wouldn’t listen to them, and, as I carn’t read,
I couldn’t learn any more, sir. My big brother
and father used to learn me some, but I never
could get enough out of them for the streets;
besides, father was out of work still, and we
couldn’t get money enough to buy ballads with,
and it’s no good singing without having them
to sell. We live over there, sir, (pointing to
a window on the other side of the narrow
street).</p>

<p>“The notion come into my head all of itself
to sweep crossings, sir. As I used to go up
Regent-street I used to see men and women,
and girls and boys, sweeping, and the people
giving them money, so I thought I’d do the
same thing. That’s how it come about.
Just now the weather is so dry, I don’t go to
my crossing, but goes out singing. I’ve learnt
some new songs, such as ‘The Queen of the
Navy for ever,’ and ‘The Widow’s Last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
Prayer,’ which is about the wars. I only go
sweeping in wet weather, because then’s the
best time. When I am there, there’s some
ladies and gentlemen as gives to me regular.
I knows them by sight; and there’s a beer-shop
where they give me some bread and
cheese whenever I go.</p>

<p>“I generally takes about sixpence, or sevenpence,
or eightpence on the crossing, from
about nine o’clock in the morning till four in
the evening, when I come home. I don’t
stop out at nights because father won’t let
me, and I’m got to be home to see to baby.</p>

<p>“My broom costs me twopence ha’penny,
and in wet weather it lasts a week, but in dry
weather we seldom uses it.</p>

<p>“When I sees the busses and carriages
coming I stands on the side, for I’m afeard of
being runned over. In winter I goes out and
cleans ladies’ doors, general about Lincoln’s-inn,
for the housekeepers. I gets twopence a
door, but it takes a long time when the ice is
hardened, so that I carn’t do only about two or
three.</p>

<p>“I carn’t tell whether I shall always stop at
sweeping, but I’ve no clothes, and so I carn’t
get a situation; for, though I’m small and
young, yet I could do housework, such as
cleaning.</p>

<p>“No, sir, there’s no gang on my crossing&mdash;I’m
all alone. If another girl or a boy was to
come and take it when I’m not there, I should
stop on it as well as him or her, and go shares
with ’em.”</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Girl Crossing-Sweeper.</span></h5>

<p>I was told that a little girl formed one of
the association of young sweepers, and at my
request one of the boys went to fetch her.</p>

<p>She was a clean-washed little thing, with a
pretty, expressive countenance, and each time
she was asked a question she frowned, like a
baby in its sleep, while thinking of the answer.
In her ears she wore instead of rings loops of
string, “which the doctor had put there because
her sight was wrong.” A cotton velvet
bonnet, scarcely larger than the sun-shades
worn at the sea-side, hung on her shoulders,
leaving exposed her head, with the hair as
rough as tow. Her green stuff gown was hanging
in tatters, with long three-cornered rents
as large as penny kites, showing the grey lining
underneath; and her mantle was separated
into so many pieces, that it was only held
together by the braiding at the edge.</p>

<p>As she conversed with me, she played with
the strings of her bonnet, rolling them up as
if curling them, on her singularly small and
also singularly dirty fingers.</p>

<p>“I’ll be fourteen, sir, a fortnight before next
Christmas. I was born in Liquorpond-street,
Gray’s Inn-lane. Father come over from Ireland,
and was a bricklayer. He had pains in
his limbs and wasn’t strong enough, so he give
it over. He’s dead now&mdash;been dead a long
time, sir. I was a littler girl then than I am
now, for I wasn’t above eleven at that time.
I lived with mother after father died. She
used to sell things in the streets&mdash;yes, sir, she
was a coster. About a twelvemonth after
father’s death, mother was taken bad with the
cholera, and died. I then went along with both
grandmother and grandfather, who was a
porter in Newgate Market; I stopped there
until I got a place as servant of all-work. I
was only turned, just turned, eleven then. I
worked along with a French lady and gentleman
in Hatton Garden, who used to give me
a shilling a-week and my tea. I used to go
home to grandmother’s to dinner every day.
I hadn’t to do any work, only just to clean the
room and nuss the child. It was a nice little
thing. I couldn’t understand what the French
people used to say, but there was a boy working
there, and he used to explain to me what
they meant.</p>

<p>“I left them because they was going to a
place called Italy&mdash;perhaps you may have
heerd tell of it, sir. Well, I suppose they must
have been Italians, but we calls everybody,
whose talk we don’t understand, French. I
went back to grandmother’s, but, after grandfather
died, she couldn’t keep me, and so I
went out begging&mdash;she sent me. I carried
lucifer-matches and stay-laces fust. I used to
carry about a dozen laces, and perhaps I’d sell
six out of them. I suppose I used to make
about sixpence a-day, and I used to take it
home to grandmother, who kept and fed me.</p>

<p>“At last, finding I didn’t get much at begging,
I thought I’d go crossing-sweeping. I
saw other children doing it. I says to myself,
‘I’ll go and buy a broom,’ and I spoke to another
little girl, who was sweeping up Holborn,
who told me what I was to do. ‘But,’ says
she, ‘don’t come and cut up me.’</p>

<p>“I went fust to Holborn, near to home, at
the end of Red Lion-street. Then I was
frightened of the cabs and carriages, but I’d
get there early, about eight o’clock, and sweep
the crossing clean, and I’d stand at the side
on the pavement, and speak to the gentlemen
and ladies before they crossed.</p>

<p>“There was a couple of boys, sweepers at
the same crossing before I went there. I went
to them and asked if I might come and sweep
there too, and they said Yes, if I would give
them some of the halfpence I got. These was
boys about as old as I was, and they said, if I
earned sixpence, I was to give them twopence
a-piece; but they never give me nothink of
theirs. I never took more than sixpence, and
out of that I had to give fourpence, so that I
did not do so well as with the laces.</p>

<p>“The crossings made my hands sore with
the sweeping, and, as I got so little, I thought
I’d try somewhere else. Then I got right down
to the Fountings in Trafalgar-square, by the
crossing at the statey on ’orseback. There
were a good many boys and girls on that crossing
at the time&mdash;five of them; so I went along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
with them. When I fust went they said,
‘Here’s another fresh ’un.’ They come up to
me and says, ‘Are you going to sweep here?’
and I says, ‘Yes;’ and they says, ‘You mustn’t
come here, there’s too many;’ and I says,
‘They’re different ones every day,’&mdash;for they’re
not regular there, but shift about, sometimes
one lot of boys and girls, and the next day
another. They didn’t say another word to me,
and so I stopped.</p>

<p>“It’s a capital crossing, but there’s so many
of us, it spiles it. I seldom gets more than
sevenpence a-day, which I always takes home
to grandmother.</p>

<p>“I’ve been on that crossing about three
months. They always calls me Ellen, my
regular name, and behaves very well to me.
If I see anybody coming, I call them out as
the boys does, and then they are mine.</p>

<p>“There’s a boy and myself, and another
strange girl, works on our side of the statey,
and another lot of boys and girls on the other.</p>

<p>“I like Saturdays the best day of the week,
because that’s the time as gentlemen as has
been at work has their money, and then they
are more generous. I gets more then, perhaps
ninepence, but not quite a shilling, on
the Saturday.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a threepenny-bit give to me, but
never sixpence. It was a gentleman, and I
should know him again. Ladies gives me less
than gentlemen. I foller ’em, saying, ‘If you
please, sir, give a poor girl a halfpenny;’ but
if the police are looking, I stop still.</p>

<p>“I never goes out on Sunday, but stops at
home with grandmother. I don’t stop out at
nights like the boys, but I gets home by ten
at latest.”</p>

that “by reducing prices it extends the market, and so,
causing a greater demand for the commodities, induces a
greater quantity of employment,” would also be an
argument in favour of over population, since this, by
cheapening labour, must have the same effect as machinery
on prices, and, consequently (according to the above
logic), induce a greater quantity of employment! But
granting that machinery really does benefit the labourer
in cases <i>where the market, and therefore the quantity of
work, is largely extensible</i>, surely it cannot but be an injury
in those callings where <i>the quantity of work is fixed</i>. Such
is the fact with the sawing of wood, the reaping of corn,
the threshing of corn, the sweeping of the streets, &amp;c.,
and hence the evil of mechanical labour applied to such
trades.</p></div>

comes a long interval of “no returns,” and after 1839 we
have the numbers for only <i>three months</i> in each year,
from 1840 up to 1843; in the first annual Report (1848)
these returns for one quarter in each year are continued

according to Parker’s Glossary of Architecture, was
“the wall or screen at the back of an altar, seat, &amp;c.;
it was usually ornamented with panelling, &amp;c., especially
behind an altar, and sometimes was enriched with a profusion
of niches, buttresses, pinnacles, statues, and other
decorations, which were often painted with brilliant
colours.
</p>
<p>
“The open fire-hearth, frequently used in ancient
domestic halls, was likewise called a reredos.
</p>
<p>
“In the description of Britain prefixed to Holinshed’s
‘Chronicles,’ we are told that formerly, before chimneys
were common in mean houses, ‘each man made his fire
against a reredosse in the hall, where he dined and dressed
his meat.’”
</p>
<p>
The original word would appear to be <i>dosel</i> or <i>rere-dosel</i>;
for Kelham, in his “Norman Dictionary,” explains
the word <i>doser</i> or <i>dosel</i> to signify a hanging or canopy of
silk, silver, or gold work, under which kings or great
personages sit; also the back of a chair of state (the
word being probably a derivative of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dorsum</i>,
the back. <i>Dos</i>, in slang, means a <i>bed</i>, a “dossing crib”
being a sleeping-place, and has clearly the same origin).
A <i>rere-dos</i> or <i>rere-dosel</i> would thus appear to have been a
<i>screen</i> placed <i>behind</i> anything. I am told, that in the old
houses in the north of England, erections at the back of
the fire may, to this day, occasionally be seen, with an
aperture behind for the insertion of plates, and such
other things as may require warming.
</p>
<p>
A correspondent says there is “a ‘reredos,’ or open
fire-hearth, now to be seen in the extensive and beautiful
ruins of the Abbey of St. Agatha, in the North
Riding of Yorkshire. The ivy now hangs over and
partially conceals this reredos; but its form is tolerably
perfect, and the stones are still coloured by the
action of the fire, which was extinguished, I need
hardly say, by the cold water thrown on such places by
Henry VIII.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> It has been notorious for many years, that flowers
will not bloom in any natural luxuriance, and that fruit
will not properly ripen, in the heart of the city. Whilst
this is an unquestionable fact, it is also a fact, that
greatly as suburban dwellings have increased, and truly
as London may be said to have “gone into the country,”
the greater quantity of the large, excellent, unfailing,
and cheap supply of the fruits and vegetables in the
London “green” markets are grown within a circle of
from ten to twelve miles from St. Paul’s. In the course
of my inquiries (in the series of letters on Labour and
the Poor in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>) into the supply, &amp;c.,
to the “green markets” of the metropolis, I was told by
an experienced market-gardener, who had friends and
connections in several of the suburbs, that he fancied,
and others in the trade were of the same opinion, that
no gardening could be anything but a failure if attempted
within “where the fogs went.” My informant explained
to me that the fogs, so peculiar to London, did not
usually extend beyond three or four miles from the
heart of the city. He was satisfied, he said, that
within half a mile or so of this reach of fog the gardener’s
labours might be crowned with success. He
knew nothing of any scientific reason for his opinion,
but as far as a purely London fog extended (without
regard to any mist pervading the whole country as well
as the neighbourhood of the capital), he thought it was
the boundary within which there could be no proper
growth of fruit or flowers. That the London fog has its
<i>limits</i> as regards the manifestation of its greatest density,
there can be no doubt. My informant was frequently
asked, when on his way home, by omnibus drivers and
others whom he knew, and met on their way to town a
few miles from it: “How’s the fog, sir? <i>How far?</i>”
</p>
<p>
The extent of the London fog, then, if the information
I have cited be correct, may be considered as indicating
that portion of the metropolis where the
population, and consequently the smoke, is the thickest,
and within which agricultural and horticultural labours
cannot meet with success. “The nuisance of
a November fog in London,” Mr. Booth stated to
the Smoke Committee, “is most assuredly increased
by the smoke of the town, arising from furnaces and
private fires. It is vapour saturated with particles
of carbon which causes all that uneasiness and pain in
the lungs, and the uneasy sensations which we experience
in our heads. I have no doubt of the density of
these fogs arising from this carbonaceous matter.”
</p>
<p>
The loss from the impossibility of promoting vegetation
in the district most subjected to the fog is nothing,
as the whole ground is already occupied for the thousand
purposes of a great commercial city. The matter is,
however, highly curious, as a result of the London
smoke.
</p>
<p>
Concerning the frequency of fogs in the district of the
immediate neighbourhood of the metropolis, it is stated
in Weale’s “London,” that fogs “appear to be owing, 1st,
to the presence of the river; and, 2ndly, to the fact that
the superior temperature of the town produces results
precisely similar to those we find to occur upon rivers
and lakes. The cold damp currents of the atmosphere,
which cannot act upon the air of the country districts,
owing to the equality of their specific gravity, when
they encounter the warmer and lighter strata over the
town, displace the latter, intermixing with it and condensing
the moisture. Fogs thus are often to be observed
in London, whilst the surrounding country is
entirely free from them. The peculiar colour of the
London fogs appears to be owing to the fact that, during
their prevalence, the ascent of the coal smoke is impeded,
and that it is thus mixed with the condensed moisture
of the atmosphere. As is well known, they are often so
dense as to require the gas to be lighted in midday, and
they cover the town with a most dingy and depressing
pall. They also frequently exhibit the peculiarity of
increasing density after their first formation, which
appears to be owing to the descent of fresh currents
of cold air towards the lighter regions of the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
“They do not occur when the wind is in a dry quarter,
as for instance when it is in the east; notwithstanding
that there may be very considerable difference in the
temperature of the air and of the water or the ground.
The peculiar odour which attends the London fogs has
not yet been satisfactorily explained; although the uniformity
of its recurrence, and its very marked character,
would appear to challenge elaborate examination.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Of the derivation of the word <i>Sewer</i> there have been
many conjectures, but no approximation to the truth.
One of the earliest instances I have met with of any detailed
mention of sewers, is in an address delivered by a
“Coroner,” whose name does not appear, to “a jury of
sewers.” This address was delivered somewhere between
the years 1660 and 1670. The coroner having first spoken
of the importance of “Navigation and Drayning” (draining),
then came to the question of sewers.
</p>
<p>
“Sewars,” he said, “are to be accounted your
grand Issuers of Water, from whence I conceive
they carry their name (<i>Sewars quasi Issuers</i>). I shall
take his opinion who delivers them to be Currents of
Water, kept in on both sides with banks, and, in some
sense, they may be called a certain kind of a little or
small river. But as for the derivation of the word Sewar,
from two of our English words, <i>Sea</i> and <i>Were</i>, or, as
others will have it, <i>Sea</i> and <i>Ward</i>, give me leave, now I
have mentioned it, to&mdash;leave it to your judgments.
</p>
<p>
“However, this word <i>Sewar</i> is very famous amongst
us, both for giving the title of the Commission of
Sewars itself, and for being the ordinary name of most
of your common water-courses, for Drayning, and therefore,
I presume, there are none of you of these juries
but both know&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“1. What Sewars signify, and also, in particular,

<p>
“2. What they are; and of a thing so generally
known, and of such general use.”

<p>
The Rev. Dr. Lemon, who gave the world a work on
“English Etymology,” from the Greek and Latin, and
from the Saxon and Norman, was regarded as a high
authority during the latter part of the last century,
when his quarto first appeared. The following is his
account, under the head “Sewers”&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Skinn. rejects Minsh’s. deriv. of ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">olim scriptum

Fr. Gall. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eauier</i>? if he had, he would have found it distorted
ab <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὑδωρ</span>, <i>aqua</i>; <i>sewers</i> being a species of <i>aqueduct</i>:&mdash;Lye,
in his Add., gives another deriv., viz. ‘ab
Iceland. <i>sua</i>, <i>colare</i>; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut existimo; ad quod referre
vellem</span> <i>sewer</i>; <i>cloaca</i>; per <i>sordes</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbis ejiciuntur</span>:’&mdash;the
very word <i>sordes</i> gives me a hint that <i>sewer</i> may be
derived à <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">‘Σαιρω</span>, <i>vel</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σαροω</span>, <i>verro</i>: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nempe quia</span> <i>sordes</i>,

slop, dirt, &amp;c.</i>”
</p>
<p>
But these are the follies of learning. Had our lexicographers
known that the vulgar were, as Dr. Latham
says, “the conservators of the Saxon language” with us,
they would have sought information from the word
“shore,” which the uneducated, and, consequently, unperverted,
invariably use in the place of the more polite
“sewer”&mdash;the common <i>sewer</i> is always termed by them
“the common <i>shore</i>.” Now the word <i>shore</i>, in Saxon, is
written <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">score</i> and <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scor</i> (for <i>c</i> = <i>h</i>), and means not only
a bank, the land immediately next to the sea, but a
<i>score</i>, a tally&mdash;for they are both substantives, made from
the verb <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sceran</i> (p. <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scear</i>, <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scær</i>, pp. <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scoren</i>, <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gescoren</i>), to
<i>shear</i>, cut off, <i>share</i>, divide; and hence they meant, in the
one case, the division of the land from the sea; and in
the other, a division cut in a piece of wood, with a view
to counting. The substantive <i>scar</i> has the same origin;
as well as the verb to <i>score</i>, to cut, to gash. The Scandinavian
cognates for the Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scor</i> may be cited as
proofs of what is here asserted. They are, Icel., <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">skor</i>, a
notch; Swed., <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">skâra</i>, a notch; and Dan., <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">skaar</i> and
<i>skure</i>, a notch, an incision. It would seem, therefore,
that the word <i>shore</i>, in the sense of <i>sewer</i> (Dan., <i lang="da" xml:lang="da">skure</i>;
Anglice, <i>shure</i>, for <i>k</i> = <i>h</i>), originally meant merely a
<i>score</i> or incision made in the ground, a <i>ditch</i> sunk with
the view of carrying off the refuse-water, a watercourse,
and consequently a drain. A sewer is now a covered
ditch, or channel for refuse water.</p></div>

in another, full one quarter of wheat more, and one load

“With regard to the fertilizing properties of this
preparation, M. Maxime Paulet, in his work entitled

fertilizing qualities of various descriptions of manure,
the value of each being determined by the quantity of
nitrogen it contains. Taking for a standard good
farm-yard dung, which contains on an average 4 per
1000 of nitrogen, and assuming that 10,000 kilogrammes
(about 22,000 lbs. English) of this manure
(containing 40 kilogrammes of nitrogen) are necessary
to manure one hectare (2&frac12; acres nearly) of land,

“M. Paulet estimates the loss of the ammoniacal
products contained in the fæcal matters when they
are withdrawn from the cesspools, by the time they
have been ultimately reduced into poudrette, at from
80 to 90 per cent.
</p>
<p>
“I have not been able to meet with an analysis of
the matters found in the fixed and movable cesspools
of Paris, but in the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cours d’Agriculture</span>,’ of M. le
Comte de Gasparin, I find an analysis by MM.
Payen and Boussingault of some matter taken from
the cesspools of Lille, and in the state in which it is
ordinarily used in the suburbs of that city as manure.
This matter was found to contain on the average 0·205
per cent of nitrogen, and thus by the rule observed
in drawing up the above table, 19,512 kilogrammes of
it would be necessary to produce the same effect upon
one hectare of land as the other manures there mentioned.
The wide difference between this quantity
and that (1333 kilogrammes) stated for the mixed
human excrements in their undiluted state, would
lead to the conclusion that a very large proportion of
water was present in the matter sent from Lille,
unless we are to attribute a portion of the difference to
the accidental circumstance of the bad quality of this
matter. It appears that this is very variable, according
to the style of living of the persons producing it.
‘Upon this subject,’ M. Paulet says, ‘the case of an
agriculturist in the neighbourhood of Paris is cited,
who bought the contents of the cesspools of one of the
fashionable restaurants of the Palais Royal. Making
a profitable speculation of it, he purchased the matter
of the cesspools of several barracks. This bargain,
however, resulted in a loss, for the produce from this
last matter came very short of that given by the first.’
</p>
<p>
“Poudrette weighs 70 kilogrammes the hectolitre
(154 lbs. per 22 gallons), and the quantity usually
spread upon one hectare of land (2&frac12; acres nearly) is
1750 kilogrammes, being at the rate of about 1540 lbs.
per acre English measure. It is cast upon the land by
the hand, in the manner that corn is sown.
</p>
<p>
“Poudrette packed in sacks very soon destroys
them. This is always the case, whether it is whole
or has been newly prepared.
</p>
<p>
“A serious accident occurred in 1818, on board a
vessel named the <i>Arthur</i>, which sailed from Rouen
with a cargo of poudrette for Guadaloupe. During
the voyage a disease broke out on board which carried
off half the crew, and left the remainder in a deplorable
state of health when they reached their destination.
It attacked also the men who landed the cargo; they
all suffered in a greater or less degree. The poudrette
was proved to have been shipped during a wet season,
and to have been exposed before and during shipment,
in a manner to allow it to absorb a considerable
quantity of moisture. The accident appears to have
been due to the subsequent fermentation of the mass
in the hold&mdash;increased to an intense degree by the
moisture it had acquired, and by the heat of a tropical
climate.
</p>
<p>
“M. Parent du Châtelet, to whom the matter was
referred, recommended that to guard against similar
accidents in future, the poudrette intended for exportation,
in order to deprive it entirely of humidity,
should be mixed with an absorbent powder, such as
quicklime, and that it should be packed in casks to
protect it from moisture during the voyage.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> “It is in the upper basins,” adds the Reports,
“that the first separation of the liquids and solids
takes place, the latter falling to the bottom, and the
former gradually flowing off through a sluice into the
lower basins. This first separation, however, is by no
means complete, a considerable deposit taking place
in the lower basins. The mass in the upper basins,
after three or four years, then appears like a thick
mud, half liquid, half solid; it is of depth varying
from 12 to 15 feet. In order entirely to get rid of the
liquids, deep channels are then cut across the mass,
by which they are drained off, when the deposit soon
becomes sufficiently stiff to permit of its being dug
out and spread upon the drying-ground, where, to
assist the desiccation, it is turned over two or three
times a-day by means of a harrow drawn by a horse.
</p>
<p>
“The time necessary for the requisite desiccation
varies a good deal, according to the season of the year,
the temperature, and the dry or moist state of the
atmosphere. Ere yet it is entirely deprived of humidity,
the matter is collected into heaps, varying in
size usually from 8 to 10 yards high, and from 60
to 80 yards long, by 25 or 30 yards wide. These
heaps or mounds generally remain a twelvemonth
untouched, sometimes even for two or three years;
but as fast as the material is required, they are
worked from one of the sides by means of pickaxes,
shovels, and rakes; the pieces separated are then
easily broken and reduced to powder, foreign substances
being carefully excluded. This operation,
which is the last the matter undergoes, is performed
by women. The poudrette then appears like a mould
of a grey-black colour, light, greasy to the touch, finely
grained, and giving out a particular faint and nauseous
odour.
</p>
<p>
“The finer particles of matter carried by the liquids
into the lower basins, and there more gradually deposited
in combination with a precipitate from the
urine, yield a variety of poudrette, preferred, by the
farmers, for its superior fertilizing properties. In this
case the drying process is conducted more slowly and
with more difficulty than in the other, but more completely.
</p>
<p>
“In general the poudrette is dried with great difficulty;
it appears to have an extreme affinity for
water; few substances give out moisture more slowly,
or absorb it more greedily from the air.
</p>
<p>
“A good deal of heat is generated in the heaps of
desiccated matter. This is always sensible to the touch,
and sometimes results in spontaneous combustion.
</p>
<p>
“The intensity of this heat is not in proportion to
the elevation of temperature of the atmosphere. It is
promoted by moisture. The only means of extinguishing
the fire when it is once developed is to turn over the
mass from top to bottom, in order to expose it to the
air. Water thrown upon it, unless in very large quantities,
would only increase its activity.”</p></div>

that of a London cesspool. If the dwellers in a

averaged between seven and eight, as in London, the
cesspool contents in Paris would, at the above rate,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
